Movie Title,Review-Title,Review-Description
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Not sorry I watched it,"Is it a story that has been told before? Yes. Were parts exceedingly slow? Yes. I was able to fast forward without losing the storyline as the storyline is pretty predictable? It's a movie about people fighting for their freedom. Yes. I agree with most that have said there was little to no character development. There is little that really bonds our hero's together, other than hey I am building this team. In part two, I hope that slow-mo is not used for the action sequences as much as this one. Visually the movie is pretty as was the epic music for the scoring. Acting is well done as I enjoy the work of most of the actors. I found it slightly hilarious that both characters that played Daario in GOT were in this movie. I am guessing from hints of this movie what part two is going to reveal. I will watch part two because I want to know if I am correct or not."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Not unwatchable... but neither is it good,"I SHOULD have loved this movie, I am an avid Sci-Fi fan and love watching properties from Starwars, Star Trek, Star Gate, Dune, Serenity, etc. And their spin-offs. This movie clearly wants to be those... but it is just a disjointed mess. Zero character development - Characters are just thrown at you without any reasoning or explanation. We have no idea who anyone is, why they do what they do, etc. We are just expected to accept that these people exist and are willing to join together in the fight. It literally is ""let's go get this guy"" then they after a couple minutes of ""look how cool this person is"" we are expected to just accept them into the story. Slipshod world building - As with the character development, the ""world"" where this occurs just unfolds in a way that is confusing. Things are just thrown at you and you have to accept them. In the end, it was ""this group is BAD"" and ""this group is GOOD"", without any nuance or background. Cliche'd imagery - Half way through, we started playing the game, ""where did they steal that from."" the whole movie is a mashup of scenes and concepts taken from other Sci-Fi and Fantasy movies. We'd shout out, ""that's from Harry Potter!"" and ""they took that from Firefly!"" pretty much every since scene in the entire movie. Pointless story - The whole story just is a strung together set of scenes that don't seem to have a point. The final climax was unsatisfying, made worse because the poor character and world development meant we didn't really care who lived or died. Then, the whole thing ended with a huge cliche. The movie was billed as ""an adult Starwars,"" instead, it feels more like fan fiction. We didn't turn it off, it was just (barely) entertaining enough to keep watching. And, I will likely watch the second movie. But, this was just one long missed opportunity."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),"Great VFX, but worn out story and lazy writing","This is visually an impressive movie, and it's certainly entertaining; but there's something really amiss with the story, in fact with the whole writing; as well as with the casting and acting, and with the cinematography of some of the fighting sequences. To begin on the positive side: the VFX are topnotch, from alien creatures to galactic worlds to epic spaceship-battles: it's all awesomely done and totally convincing. The score is great, and some of the actors are a real treat for the eye, be it Sofia Boutella as main character Kora, she's absolutely beautiful and has an almost regal charisma (fitting her role), or some of the impressively built male characters (like Dijon Hounsou and Stan Nair). But then my reservations. The story feels like we've seen it a dozen times before in this kind of epic galactic scifi movies: yet another universe with a dictatorial repressive central regime; myriads of downtrodden and exploited common people; and from the latter the rise of a resistance under the banner of some heroic messiah-like leader. It's Starwars, Dune and Foundation (and a whole lot of others) all put in a blender. The writing felt lazy: by using a voice-over at the start of the movie I had within 5 minutes the impression that I had missed a prequel or an episode 0, pulling me into an already fast riding train. The search for the right resistance team-members felt rushed, skipping from one weird world to the next, giving the various characters hardly any depth or even motivation for their willingness to come along. The result is a succession of short anecdotical scenes without real substance. As to the acting: Sofia Boutella constantly has to keep up an almost frozen attitude, so there's hardly any room for her to shine; and Michiel Huisman sure has more potential than this role of a non-descript hanger-on. Ed Skrein does a good job as the (almost caricaturally) sadistic Atticus, but the rest of the cast is just adequate. And another annoying thing: the potentially interesting fighting scenes are all afflicted by a weird whim of the director, to vary within one scene from regular motion to slow, to slower than slow, and to regular motion again. Who do you think to please with such mannerisms?! Anyway, maybe (as with the disappointing first episode of the new ""Dune"") this Part One mainly acts as an overture to the Real Thing in the expected Part Two. We'll wait and see, but for now I have my doubts."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Ignore all the low ratings and immerse yourself in this journey,"My title says it all, sincerely . Zack is brilliant. Watcher is amazing and a masterpiece. And so is Rebel Moon. Low rating doesnt do this movie justice and rather uneducated or void of certain standard of appreciation I love the flow , its character development & characters screen time has its respective special scene moment is well used & well deserved . Action scene is not over exaggerated to a comical level but rather entertainingly dramatic enough . There's lots i could say about this movie so just go and enjoy it . Maybe should just go back to watching cartoons. Just Another Zack masterpiece."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),As bad as the press says.. and then some!,"I wanted to check, it really is an appallingly bad movie. Am I alone in seeing how this was written, designed and even story boarded with extensive use of AI? Every aspect of this movie is made up from a large amount of meaningless content without any connective tissue whatsoever. A soup of randomly collected assets. The clumsy attempt at bringing three dimensionality to incredibly flat characters through unjustified changes of mind.. The tasteless production design.. the atemporality of events. Clearly Netflix tried an AI heavy pipeline in order to more make money. The result is grotesque."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),A Misadventure in Cinematic Excess,"In Zack Snyder's 'Rebel Moon,' the spectacle eclipses the soul. This leap into a 'Star Wars'-like universe lands in a charmless sandbox, with Snyder's overindulgence in slow-motion for even the simplest actions serving more as a narrative hindrance than an enhancement. The characters, as deep as action figures, meander through a plot stitched together from clichés of B-movie westerns and Kurosawa's classics, yet devoid of their essence. This space opera, embedded with 'Star Wars' DNA, fails to evoke the sense of awe and wonder it ambitiously aims for. Visually striking it may be, yet it's a landscape emotionally barren. Unlike 'Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam,' the Turkish cult classic that playfully dabbled with 'Star Wars' themes with a tongue-in-cheek approach, 'Rebel Moon' takes itself too seriously, morphing into an expensive parody, a shadow of the cinematic titans it attempts to replicate. In conclusion, 'Rebel Moon' is a visual feast starved of substance, proving that sometimes, less is indeed more in storytelling. Snyder's fondness for slow motion only adds to the film's overbearing atmosphere, making it a cumbersome watch."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Full of potential Diaster that Sad,"Story 1/10
Script 2/10
Pacing 2/10
Characters 0/10
Cinematography 6/10
World building 5/10
Visuals 6/10
Sound design 7/10. As an admirer of Zack Snyder over the years it is sad to see such a failing in story, script, and wrong casting types. The world building is fine, we know that he has that potential. Unfortunately, it appears that rather than letting the characters and their story build the world and then it is informing back on its characters, it is that the world building was done with lack of attention. As well filmmakers have forced all the story and its beings into this shell. Seen through the portfolio of Snyder, I imagine it is the story writer and focusing on what is it that he is exploring, would give him freedom to play around with his artistic colours and camera movement."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Star Wars meets Sucker Punch,"I didn't watch this for the plot, since even the slim synopsis made me understand that this was a remake of Seven Samurai set in space. I hoped that Snyder could manage to inject something new into the old plot, but it was just eye candy and slow-motion fight scenes; it's really Sucker Punch all over again, with short cool sequences held together by the thinnest of threads. The actors actually try their best to roll with the punches thrown at them by the script; sometimes they fail, sometimes they succeed, but nothing they do can actually save this wreck. A note about the bad guys: in recent movies the scripts evolved from ""evil emprire"" or ""evil Sauron"" to something more complex and layered (there are movies where we actually root for the bad guy because he has the moral high ground); this movie is a huge step back towards a ""main characters good, adversaries bad"" simplicity."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Felt like it was unfinished,"It was decent to start with & had a bunch of good points throughout it. But really felt like an unfinished movie that had a lot left out because of its inclusive rating. Part way through it started to feel like it was pushed towards young teens who need fast pacing and lots going on, even if the story is left unfinished / characters aren't fleshed out. Not often do I get to a point in a movie where I just don't really care about what's happening anymore. Visuals & sound were very good though (watching with Atmos & Projector). Checked again before reviewing today & found there is going to be a full cut of the movie as well. (director / snyder cut) that is higher rated. Hopefully it has the same quality improvements overall like Justice League did (but not the annoying 4:3 aspect ratio). As that was a massive improvement on the theater release (which was as bad as this movie)."
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire (2023),Stylish space opera is OK but lacks new ideas,"Part 1 is obviously set-up; we meet the ""Seven Samurai"" characters and get some world-building. The characters are rather simple; the good guys have honor; no one else does. There's a giant spider woman and evil creatures that look like orcs -- feels a bit like Tolkien's LOTR in Space (although there's no MacGuffin {One Ring} so far) with Warhammer-style ships and weapons. And we have an over-the-top stereotypical Nazi villain. The word derivative comes to mind. The casting seems generally fine, but the choice of Sofia Boutella (Hotel Artemis) for a super-warrior is a bit of a stretch. She's athletic but a bit unconvincing; I like her but I think she would have been better cast as a secondary warrior or perhaps a thief; she seems a bit small to go up against some of the hulking adversaries (but granted, her character's combat skills are impressively well-rounded). This Netflix movie begins and ends on an agricultural planet (The Shire?) populated by pseudo-Viking peasants. There's a town with a space-port full of dubious characters (think Star Wars ""bar"" scene). Conceptually, this is only a three (3) star film. But it gets a 1-star bonus for the impressive visuals, and another for the Zach Snyder touch. That's five (5) stars total. BTW, my favorite character is the thoughtful, melancholy robot -- the only story element that lingers, sadly."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),To be (king) or not to be,"No pun intended - this is not the worst movie ever. At least I don't feel it is. But I doubt it will make many top lists (be it year or genre or anything else for that matter). It does look good and I reckon James Wan knows how to shoot a movie. There are quite a few jokes that do not really work - and quite a bit of editing that feels off ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow (of water). The ending is also a bit anti-climatic and there is not much in the way of sense ... also try not to use logic! Or think the movie applies it. Furthermore, this does not only use an actor you may recognize from a small role in the MCU ... but it also copies one particular (and very famous) ending from an MCU movie ... I swim therefor I am I guess. Not the mic drop moment the movie thinks it is. The CGI is good - but the whole movie feels a bit off. It is a nice touch that it sometimes does things without dialog, just with the actors nodding to each other ... and yet this feels weird - and not in a good sense. After watching the movie I watched the Pitch Meeting that was made for this (a real funny Youtube channel that I can highly recommend) ... the super easy, barely an inconvenience quote is easy to guess - if you have seen the movie. A weird way to end the current DCEU ... but as they would say: The King is dead, long live the King (not literally of course)"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),This movie would be ok if it wasn't the last DCEU movie,"There is a lot of superhero fatigue today and this movie feels like another superhero movie. That's it. Just another superhero movie. This movie was a fun ride to say the least. This version of aquaman is a fun spin on the character by giving him a surfer/ biker type of style. The character stays consistent and lovable throughout the movie. You can tell Jason Momoa loves playing aquaman. The plot of the movie along with the antagonist are very generic. They hardly develop black manta's character in this movie. They just add in lines like saying ""thank God for global warming."" This movie knew and poked fun at the fact that aquaman is kind of a silly character at times but I don't feel as if it was unfitting. This movie is an ok superhero movie, but definitely nothing close to a fitting end to the DCEU. I mean... the last scene of this movie (THE LAST SCENE OF THE DCEU) is aquaman's brother eating a cockroach."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),Better than i expected...,"I read a lot of bad reviews about this film but it wasn't as bad as they say. Sure is not as good as the first aquaman film was but it's above average despite the numerous flaws. The plot is axceptable makes sense and the effects are great as momoa saves the day as always with his performance. There are parts of the movie that may get you tiresome but overall u will enjoy this sequel. At least it was way better than many of the phase IV dc entries which failed miserably like those beep new entries of shazam, the marvels, wakanda forever and that atrocius flash entry. At least this new aquaman entry is decent and u should check it out. Grade B- (7 out of 10)"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),Honestly... not bad at all,"I went in with low expectations, but if I'm being honest (speaking as an Aquaman hater besides the animated version on the Justice League Animated show) I liked this movie. Black Manta honestly was really, really cool in this sequel and the fight scenes that took place in this movie were what I expect superhero films to do more of when it comes to beings going toe-to-toe with super strength. The fight scenes that take place towards the end of the movie is what I was hoping for Ant-Man 3, The Flash, and The Marvels to show us so I appreciate James Wan and everyone else who worked on the editing and fight choreography. After seeing this movie, I wish this wasn't the end of the DCEU, or Jason Momoa's Aquaman. I don't know how Gunn is going to top it, but it will be interesting to see."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom review,"Thus marking the end of a franchise, albeit in a disappointing manner. I was really disappointed that instead of getting them to cleaning up their act, and make the final entry of DCEU somewhat a better ending, it instead dives into the clichés of recent superhero movies, from the cheaply made CGI that served for the purpose of spectacle and nothing more, forced attempts of humor, horrible screenplay. But unlike Shazam 2, Quantumania, and The Flash, Aquaman 2 dig even deeper into the mediocrity, and ends up even worse than than the aforementioned films. Whether the result of reshoots or a genuine lack of scriptwriting competence, hence why the delays of the film releases, the outcome is nonetheless marked by significant amounts of lazy exposition, a hilariously incoherent plot, and cringe-worthy dialogues, painfully delivered by whoever participated in this. If there's anything positive that is worth mentioned, I'd come up with Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. These two are probably the only actors who genuinely committed themselves to their roles in a serious manner. In the midst of this cinematic wreckage, they stand as the only legitimate sources of interest and charisma, delivering performances that are far more than anything this movie deserved. As for the others, I can't say much about them, other than that most of them are fed up with their presented material. And to be honest, I understand why. Overall, my enjoyment of this movie is unfortunately outweighed by my immense disappointment. It's really sad and disheartening that the creative minds behind this debacle abandoned any semblance of effort early in the production. In a proper conclusion, I'm at the point that I'm not enraged, but rather feel sorry of the miserable way to end this franchise."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),"Not perfect, but has enjoyable moments....","6.5/10 (Recommend) The ""Lost Kingdom"" is only marginally better than the first, and not even for the story. A lot of what I liked about this film had to do with the visuals and sound, but I was also happy with the character utilization and development that was offered. There's a lot of flair going on when it comes to the fighting. It doesn't contain the most exhilarating fighting sequences, but it's enough to get my heart racing. While at times they're over the top in terms of what damage can be done to a superhero before they're exhausted. They're still entertaining and spread out enough throughout the film to keep me interested. I loved the soundtrack that went along with the film. It truly enhances the film to greater heights. The intensity of what happens next. The pulsation of the next attack. All of it go hand in hand with the music. Visually, this film is more toned down in terms of colour, but not in the vibrance or darkness when needed. With all the sea creatures that exist, the explosions that occur, and the unreal made real. This film does a perfect job in my eyes in maintaining the integrity of realism for things that are always easy to do, or are always skimmed over. I enjoyed the character utilization and development compared to the first film especially for Patrick Wilson. I didn't like him in the first film, but with better screen time here I do. As a character you can't remove Mera because of the important role she has, but her screen time seems to be less. The story isn't great, but it's not boring. Some aspects seem silly and others unnecessary, but it works out in the end. It's not as clear cut as I would like, but I can still follow what is being put down. Overall, it's still worth checking out, but not in 3D. I know ""Lost Kingdom"" is getting a lot of mediocre reviews, but it's not the worse superhero movie ever. Good visuals, great music, and enjoyable character development are what has really drawn me in. That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),Good but with rushed development,The film through entertainting is confusing as most characters from the first film are reduced to NPCs trying to do overused cinematic tropes like Mera and Atlanna being just there as Aquaman's romantic interest and mother and Thomas Curry and Black Manta and Orm being ripoffs of Uncle Ben and Green Goblin from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films with a few AI-generated lines and Topo being the cute animal character to sell merch. And despite Arthur narrating the events of the first film in the first seconds there is not much time for people who didn't watch it to know them and most of the sad moments feel fake and you can't really relate to the characters. It ripoffs Thor: The Dark World storyline and some entire sequences along with Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),You have got to be kidding...,What on Earth did I just walk in to? I attended Aquaman 2 on New Years Day with my spouse. We both liked the first one (probably I more than her) and thought it was one of the more promising WB/DC franchises but what did I just watch? 2 minutes in and all the red flags were waiving that this was going to be bad. Really bad. The CGI was so inconsistent that some scenes were excellent and others looked like someone filmed a game of Diablo II with a VHS camcorder and shoved it in. The dialogue was possibly the worst I've ever seen in a big budget film. They tried so hard to sell a Thor Ragnarok Loki/Thor buddy film at one point Arthur calls his brother Loki (just in case you didn't get it!)
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),We enjoyed this movie even more than the first Aquaman installment,"My wife and I watched Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) last night in theaters. The storyline follows Black Manta, still hellbent on revenge, who discovers a forgotten kingdom's trident, granting him powers from beyond the grave. With the ability to attack Atlantis and unleash world-destroying powers, Aquaman must seek the assistance of his imprisoned brother to stop Manta. Directed by James Wan (Saw), the film stars Jason Momoa (Fast X), Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy), Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Candyman), Amber Heard (Drive Angry), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), and John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings). We enjoyed this movie even more than the first Aquaman installment. The writing is exceptional, maintaining a consistent pace with no breaks in comedy, action, or engaging story set-ups. The well-written dialogue includes fun references to Loki, Prison of Azkaban, and Castaway, providing worthwhile moments of humor. The banter between the brothers throughout the film is entertaining. The special effects, particularly in Atlantis and underwater scenes, are top-notch. Black Manta proves to be a compelling villain, and the story behind his new power is impressive. The action scenes live up to expectations, and the conclusion is a perfect way to wrap up this DC universe. In conclusion, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is another remarkable addition to the superhero genre. It's regrettable that this series will be coming to an end. I would score this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023),Nothing more than standard,"Despite the fact, that this movie is the cotinuation of the first part, the first half hour seems to be relatively disoriented. Besides the narrative, that Aquaman has a family now and is a not so conventional king, there is not much exposition which introduce into the movie. The story is a standard fantasy plot, not really good, but not that bad. However, using the same antagonist from the first movie a second time feels uninspired and boring. All actors provide a good performance, especially Bateman and Momoa, who portray the unequal brothers, have a nice chemistry. Although the movie has its moments, for example the underwater world, it was boring overall."
Animal (I) (2023),It is fun movie,"Boys evenly i also imagine my character into ranbir's character that make this movie more fun. The violence and toxicity is greater than i imagine or also greater than sandeep reddy vanga previous films such as kabir singh but it is fun thing i mean the people should consider it as ""just a movie"" and don't spread hate about it the Bobby deol,Ranbir singh,Rashmika mandanna,Anil kapoor,Tripti dimri did excellent work and Sandeep reddy vanga also did a excellent work and it is definitely a blockbuster movie and Sandeep reddy vanga should also make movies like this .I am definitely giving it a 10 stars."
Animal (I) (2023),One of the best movie Bollywood has ever made!!!,"I saw this movie's trailer almost 20 times because it gave a very different vibe which I usually don't get by watching any trailer. And I knew it from that day that this movie is something different and I was super excited about this movie and yesss, when i watched this movie, my godddd!!!!!, what a movie. Every single minute was filled with excitement of what's coming next, even after being so long it made me fill like ""I want more!!"". And I know people have a very different opinion on this movie and a lot of controversies going around that, and even in my family my sisters, my cousins,y uncle, they didn't like the movie but that's alright cause everybody have a different opinion but I will just say that this movie completed me like I'm not even exaggerating, after watching this movie this movie i feeled like I was missing on something or just somthing was incompleted which got completed, like this is so new so different and so my type, and if have this kind of taste in movie you are gonna lovvveeee thisss movie, like everything is so perfect, Ranbir Kapoor's acting my goddd, he is the best, then the OG Anil kapoor sir and Bobby deol killed it, everyone was so perfect. And this movie is the best."
Animal (I) (2023),Deviating the Society to Violence..,I totally agree there is a message to a father who is been loved by a son.. However the movie has lots of violence and adult scenes which seems to be a bad impact on the viewers.... My message to the director is please reduce the exposure and violence a movie should always be an entertainment and a message oriented. I am sure if you consider the above suggestion .. You will certainly come up with a movie which would be loved by many viewers.. The younger generation has to learn the reality of life let's not make them more cynical.please think about this on a serious note a friendly advise to the director.
Animal (I) (2023),Awesome,"Awesome screenplay and actors nailed it throughout the movie. Cinematography plays a crucial role in a film's visual style and storytelling. Delve into the camera work, lighting, photography, and framing, evaluating how these elements enhance or detract from the movie's overall impact. Consider how the cinematography supports the film's themes and emotions. The director is the creative force behind a film, responsible for shaping its vision and execution. Analyze the director's choices, considering their impact on the film's storytelling, pacing, and overall atmosphere. Reflect on the director's previous work, if applicable, and how this film fits into their role."
Animal (I) (2023),"8 for Theme, 2 deducted for Vulgarity!","I personally find a connection with the theme of the film which is the bond between a son and a father. It has been a tough bond with told and untold feelings, complaints and sorrows. Still they are one in the name of family. Ranbir's character was a trure Sigma family Man. Who atleast doesn't belong to our gendu GenZ generation. He loves his family, he cares about her sisters, his village and his brothers, he is responsible for the family and business after his father....... The revenge part was totally justified. The action was up to the mark of excellence. Don't get into the sold reviews of Leftists and Feminists! They are the only ones who got bullied (or even hurt) by this movie. It's not a typical b'wood movie, it's a Sandeep Reddy Vanga Movie. I only dislike 3 things 1- The old man character of Ranbir, skin show of the females (which was there only for 10 minutes, I can ignore this for a 3.30 hr long film) and Ranbir's Chain smoking. At last but not the least, Tripti Dimri doesn't deserve what she is getting. I loved her earlier characters but now I hate her. Now go watch this movie in theatres!"
Animal (I) (2023),A Deceptive Mirage Veiled in Misogyny,"From the outset, the film captivates with its stunning cinematography, drawing the audience into a world shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The narrative unfolds around a male protagonist whose charisma masks a sinister agenda, a trope that perpetuates the insidious belief that charm excuses reprehensible behavior. However, this very charm is wielded as a tool of manipulation, effectively gaslighting both characters within the story and the unsuspecting audience. One of the most distressing elements of ""Shadows of Deception"" is its endorsement of misogynistic ideals, disguised within the plot. The female characters, regrettably reduced to mere plot devices or caricatures, are subject to objectification and belittlement. Their portrayal reinforces outdated and damaging stereotypes, detracting from any semblance of a progressive storyline. A fiction, as an art form, should not serve as a vessel to perpetuate regressive attitudes or normalize the denigration of any gender. Moreover, the action sequences, while initially promising to elevate the narrative, instead derail it, plunging the audience into an over-the-top spectacle that disrupts the flow of the story. The incessant barrage of high-octane sequences overwhelms, eclipsing the depth that could have been cultivated within the plot and character development. The constant bombardment of action undermines any potential for emotional investment, leaving the audience detached and disengaged. The film's direction and screenplay, though attempting to weave an intricate web of suspense, ultimately falter in their execution. The convoluted narrative fails to offer substantive explanations or resolutions, leaving audiences perplexed and unsatisfied. The promise of a gripping storyline devolves into a labyrinth of confusion, leaving viewers grappling for coherence amidst the chaos."
Animal (I) (2023),Sick dark movie but actors did their part well,"This is a dark, depressing and psychopath movie. I am not surprised by many +ve reviews as these kind of movies are liked by a section of people. Just did not imagine so many people are in that section. Simply put in one sentence , this is a manifestation of a writers and directors sick, perverted , violent and dark mind, venting their inadequacies. I believe movies are meant for relaxation, entertainment and appreciation of art. This movie does just a little bit appreciation for art, Acting of Ranbir, Rashmika, Anil Kapoor and may be Sunny Deol too is very good. Nothing much else to take from this."
Animal (I) (2023),Don't miss the post credit scene,"Entertained throughout the 3 hours duration time, Ranbir kapoor nailed every scene, in some scenes he reminded me of Rauf lala (played by Late Mr. Rishi kapoor) He just reminded everyone why he is considered the best actor of this generation. Powerful fight sequence with songs playing in the background was a masterpiece by Sandeep Reddy vanga. Don't pay any attention to the critics, they can't digest the audacity of Sandeep Reddy vanga, putting in simple words. Highly recommended if you like movies like kill bill, john vick and please don't miss the credit scenes, it's crazy. Bobby Deol with a short role gave a massive performance. Loved other cast members as well."
Animal (I) (2023),This is the best movie ever made in Bollywood.,"Perfect Direction, Brilliant Father son story, Great acting, Phenomenal movie.. A Must watch movie. This type of movies should be promoted rather than those love stories made in Bollywood. Amazing songs sung by B praak, sonu nigam specially that papa meri jaan song absolutely brilliant lyrics it has. Great acting by ranbir kapoor till now, Action VFX is also amazing, Family love brothers everyone come together to defeat the enemy. Love should be in between mother and father rather than girlfriend wife. To summarise i would say and appeal to continue making these type of movies that show love between mother and father."
Animal (I) (2023),Different and Refreshing!,"I went in with zero expectations and sat through a 3.5 hour movie without touching my phone. The plot was truly refreshing. I am tired of seeing the classic heroic Bollywood movies where the hero can never be wrong. Vanga truly uncovers a beast. Ranbir Kapoor is shown to be an ""animal"", with some signs showing in his childhood and teenage years but really unraveling in his adulthood after a major incident. From then on, what Ranbir does is beyond imaginable. Ranbir is not shown to be a hero - he does barbaric things, goes back on his words, and doesn't respect anyone in his life. Folks who are crying about Ranbir's role really think all movie heroes are to be admired. Everyone's acting was phenomenal. Bobby Deol was GREAT, what a comeback. The interval sequence was a pleasure to watch, even though I am usually not a big fan of large action sequences. The music is great. I just wish the second half was not as dragged. I am not a big fan of Tripti Dimri's sequence. It was unnecessary and only added for the sequel. It is also funny that there is no sign of a police offer or law enforcement throughout the movie despite all the violence. But overall this was a refreshing movie. Must watch!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),A Cinematic Triumph - The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,"""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" delivers a cinematic masterpiece that not only pays homage to its source material but also stands on its own as a compelling and visually stunning addition to the Hunger Games film series. Director Francis Lawrence skillfully brings Suzanne Collins's prequel to life on the big screen, capturing the essence of the Capitol's opulence and the grittiness of the districts. The film seamlessly weaves together a gripping narrative, striking visuals, and outstanding performances, resulting in a movie that surpasses expectations. The casting choices are impeccable, with Tom Blyth giving a standout performance as the complex and morally ambiguous Coriolanus Snow. The evolution of the character is portrayed with depth and nuance, adding layers to one of the franchise's most iconic figures. The supporting cast, including Rachel Zegler, Peter Dinklage and Hunter Schafer delivers stellar performances that enhance the overall storytelling. Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. The Capitol's extravagance and the stark contrast with the districts are brought to life through breathtaking cinematography and impeccable production design. The reimagined Hunger Games arena is both awe-inspiring and menacing, creating a heightened sense of tension and excitement. The pacing is on point, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish. The film successfully balances action-packed sequences with quieter moments of character development, allowing viewers to connect emotionally with the story. The soundtrack, composed by James Newton Howard, complements the film perfectly, enhancing the overall cinematic experience. What sets ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" apart is its ability to delve into the complexities of power, morality, and survival, all while delivering a thrilling and visually captivating spectacle. The film doesn't shy away from the darker themes present in the source material, providing a thought-provoking and immersive experience for both longtime fans and newcomers to the Hunger Games universe. In conclusion, ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a triumph in filmmaking. It not only expands and enriches the Hunger Games saga but also stands as a testament to the creative talent involved in its production. This movie deserves a solid 10/10 for its outstanding performances, breathtaking visuals, and its ability to captivate audiences with a story that is both thrilling and intellectually stimulating."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Rushed and disconnected,"They didn't allow time for suspense in so many moments, the whole thing felt rushed like it should have been two films. I appreciate it's a long film but that's because they were trying to do too much all in one film. Some of the actors were over the top and theatrical rather than displaying substance which was surprising considering the big names in this movie. Some big names in this film yet they disappointed us as they really felt to of lacked depth. I've seen them in films where they have been truly astounding yet they fell flat here. I can't help but wonder if it's because of how rushed this was, you didn't have time to become invested in any of the characters. The previous hunger games reallly felt powerful and hit a nerve, this felt showy and lacking in depth. On a positive note I liked the singing and the female lead, I just wish they given her more time to provide suspense in many moments instead of rushing through. The scene with the snakes was fantastic."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Not true to the book - book spoilers,"All the hunger games movies have some differences to the book but I think this one has the most, so much that it sort of tells a different story. The actors did a great job but the story felt rushed and the characters 1 Dimensional. The tributes seem a lot more vicious in the movie, consequently sending a message like Dr. Gauls reasoning was justified. Even with that, the ending where Snow ultimately ending agreeing with Dr. Gaul's lesson seems forced. While I saw the similarity between Coral's character and Cato, (which admittedly tugged at the heart strings) I think the original writing of the tributes was better. The part of the movie featuring the tributes lacked a lot of the empathy from the writers and characters, which showed a bit more humanity in the book. Coriolanus's charm and calculation, Sejanus's kindness, and Lucy Gray's wit, caution, and consideration seemed lost in the movie. Coriolanus's and Lucy Gray's romance lacked foundation. They have this connection and trust that's slowly built in the book that isn't seen in the movie, as if it were an after thought. They both seem more concerned with self preservation but Lucy Gray significantly more so from the start. This seemed to be done purposely to move the story along but this was a mistake in my opinion. Her demands in the cage and to Coriolanus, her defensiveness when Mayfair is shot. It's a lot different than her character in the book who is capable and independent but equally selfless and caring. The book highlighted how elusive and fierce Lucy Gray could be during the hunger games and this also seemed lost in the movie. I really wish the actual hunger games had played out closer to the book than the movie. The movie would've been much better had they taken this first part of the book a bit more slowly. In the book, there doesn't seem to be any moment where Coriolanus changes whereas in the movie it seems to be in the Arena and then more so in the Forest after being bitten. The part where Tigris tells Coriolanus that he's still good seemed very useless in the movie and I wish it was taken out. The book makes Coriolanus seem more human because of how we can see Coriolanus teetering on what's right and wrong. The movie doesn't show his true thoughts on his born superiority to the people of the districts and the influence the society around him has on that. That is something I think could've easily been shown more to give him some depth to his character. The contrast between what he thinks and does vs what he says is what kept my intrigue the most throughout the book and its entirely missing in the movie. Also throughout the book, you wonder whether his feelings towards Lucy Gray are genuine (and I personally leaned towards that they were) but its very unconvincing in the movie until the near end. A weird part of the movie to get invested in a relationship that is a main plot. Coriolanus's little considerations in the choices he makes aren't shown and so his character seems robotic. It seems more like things simply keep happening to him rather than him having choices and consequence. Sejanus comes off educated, reckless, and bold in the movie as he should but he lacks the same kindness that he does in the book. Not showing him bringing all the tributes sandwiches or his support and true consideration for Coriolanus in District 12 made Coriolanus's betrayal and Sejanus's death less shocking. Where Coriolanus calls Sejanus his brother was a part that truly could've helped this in the movie. Sejanus's death was disturbing in the movie because hangings are disturbing but not because of what his character meant. I think the scene of Coriolanus crying over their picture together could've been scrapped all together had they emphasized their relationship throughout. Instead, the scene where he is crying is where it finally shows how much it affects Coriolanus. A scene I think was just blatantly bad was unfortunately where Lucy Gray and Coriolanus are in the Cabin after deserting District 12. Lucy Gray spells out the situation and even asks him if he's going to leave, which she doesn't in the book. I wish there would've been more faith in the audience to put this together, it would've been more impactful and really shown their character more. Instead everything was spelled out in big letters across the screen. Coriolanus holding the gun menacingly, Lucy Gray just standing in the corner for no apparent reason watching him, Lucy Gray basically asking to be murdered 3 times with one foot out the door before she finally leaves. Coriolanus just continuing on with what he was doing as if her distrust at this point wasn't blatantly obvious. It was truly ridiculous. This scene really took away from a lot of her mystique and again, her wit, Lucy Gray being unable to calmly, quietly and quickly put the puzzle together as she did in the book. I do think the very ending, where Coriolanus returns to Dean Highbottom was the best. Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis were excellent and so were the portrayal of their characters. I left the theatre hearing people around me describe the movie as ""corny"". I thought this was fair thinking it was possibly just all the Snow metaphors and still thinking I enjoyed the movie nonetheless. However after further reflection it was probably just how shallow the story seemed. After I read the book I was obviously disappointed in the movie because the book was incredible. I believe if the movie needed to be longer, it should've been a little longer. This being a surprising prequel to a popular triology, it had the right to be. If impossible, I still think there are a lot of changes that could've been made and retained the same runtime while having the same impact as the book. While the movie was enjoyable, I wish more credit was given to the audience in being able to understand this story instead of creating a relatively shallow movie with a morally questionable lesson."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),"New, yet nostalgic, cinematic experience","Reading the novel before the movie was the perfect choice! The movie honors Collin's captivating writing. Knowing the world from the original series made the cinematic choices exciting, which speaks to the whole production team's thoughtfulness. The capitol's depiction is beyond what I pictured in my mind while reading. Davis and Blyth kept me GLUED to the screen by their acting performances and on screen appearance - props to their makeup, hair, and wardrobe team! Jason did a great Lucky in this serious movie - it is commendable to bring humor to a dystopian world! I enjoyed going to the movies with my fellow Hunger Game fan friends (even though we really missed Peeta)! It brought back great memories!"
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Wovey has my heart! <3,"The first act was really interesting because we are reintroduced to Panem in a more realistic but different but familiar light. Lucy Gray is a true performer and just in luck that's exactly what they needed to keep the games going. Highbottom and Dr. Gaul are seen as the dark and light symbols of the path Snow's fate is subject to. While all the characters are pretty transparent about their intentions, their values change and grow overtime and their means to the end are seen as what makes them who they are. I love that the story mimics a lot of the songs that were sung. It makes me wonder what a musical based on the Hunger Games universe would look and sound like. The ending leaves a lot of questions for the audience and I hope this is a standalone movie. The song with the scene about lucy gray and the katniss is enough for all of us to assume or imagine how things turned out. Including Snow asking Tigris what she thinks. While I don't change my views towards Snow despite hearing his story, I find it interesting that he builds up so much resentment for the world because of a girl. While this is realistic and it's happened before, it's a fascinating notion that he hates Katniss Everdeen and the districts so much because a girl broke his heart."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Character motivations and actions are nonsensical,"If the hunger games was all about fascist myth making and how people just come to accept it as the new way of life, why would the protagonist be less angry 10 years into the new order than 75 years? When injustice is a new, people are supposed to be more angry, less accepting of it. Katniss was appropriately angry and defiant, whereas Lucy Gray was immediately giddy (i guess we are meant to interpret it as hippie freespirit i-love-all-peoples charm), and flirting with an agent of the state that has literally reaped her into an arena to kill her. Think of how much it would take to justify why a Jewish girl might even consider thinking of an SS soldier in a romantic light, and how little this story did to that end. The trust and romance between two characters from opposing sides of a fascist occupation has to OVERCOME that very tall barrier to earn any Rebel's trust. However even though the fact that Snow is doing it for personal gain was established, it was kind of ignored to continue this bizzare unearned romance. I am also okay with the premise that not every person in a fascist system is born evil, and showing the descent of a regular citizen into this kind of evil. However, living and participating every day in a fascist state has to impact your soul that ends up showing in small ways, casual dehuminisation of the Panem citizens, growing paranoia as the bombs start, disdain for the rebels etc. Which other characters in the academy and Grandma Snow does. But exceptionally, Snow was shown to be upstanding and moral throughout the movie except in the end with a abrupt descent into betraying his friend, all the while romancing a Panem citizen outside the district borders. It was so forced, and why?? We already knew that Snow would become evil, so why not show us how it happened in a believable manner (maybe show that his time as a peacekeeper interacting with D12 citizens allowed him to dehumanize them or something..), instead of rushing it as a ""twist"" at the very end of a very long movie? Every story in THG was a self contained plot that will be developed upon it, but this one felt like a botched incomplete story to that is built as a premise for sequels to the prequel."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Well.. just no... Teenage movie at best,"I'm writing this review only because Jason Schwartzman deserves to be mentioned. In his role he is just brilliant, so thanks for at least his performance. The casting for Snow was also not bad, but the rest of the actors can be forgotten. Above all, we couldn't stand the calling of 'Lucy Gray' after what felt like the 100th time. We're generally not big fans of singing in movies, but these songs were placed so tactlessly that it felt like imitating a Disney film. The only suspenseful part is in the last section of the movie - precisely when it ends.! It seems like the whole movie is made for teenagers. Overexplained and repetitive scenes dominate. We're glad we didn't watch the film in the cinema."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),"Good movie adaption, not as good as the novel by a longshot","It wasn't bad, but not half as good as the novel. Many things are left out, other things are portrayed differently. Considering that adapting such a complex story is really difficult, I think they did quite a good job. Pacing was too fast obviously, which isn't surprising, a running time of 158 minutes just isn't enough to cover the 500+ pages the right way. I really liked Peter Dinklage as Highbottom, he did a brilliant job imo. The portrayal of Snow and Lucy Gray's love story seemed rush and unfitting. Yes, Rachel Zegler might not be the most likeable person, but I think it's stupid to review this movie based solely on how much you dislike Zegler. I highly recommend everyone to read the novel, doesn't matter if you enjoyed the movie or not."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),"Confused, boring, bad actors","Until the end I tried to understand what this movie was supposed to be about. Unfortunately the creators left that question open. The female main actress had no purpose other than singing, looking suspicious (with no reason eventually) and the main actor focused on staring into the void most of the time, making very very unlogical decisions and flipping his mind like a burger patty. Real disappointment and big waste of time. I thought till the end, there must be a conclusion, something connecting the dots. But they left the dots as they were. Far too long, no story, bad acting, boring. If you expect something like the originals, stay away. And if you happen to understand the story, let me know."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023),Hunger Games: The Zegler Musical,"From the first moment, this movie just offers more questions than answers or any kind of plot-thread. And after around 15mins the movie-destroyer Snowwhite/Zegler appears and starts singing... really, no joke! Random people join in like its a flashmob or something and my fingers twitched to save my brain from this horses**t. I gave it another 15min and then I really had to stop it. The CGI is just awful, explosions, animals, nothing makes sense. People burn and 2mins later they're like nothing happened. My condolences to all other actors in this movie who might ruined their careers, be doomed to b-movie for the rest of their lives because of the ""Zegler Musical""."
Die Hard (1988),A Classic Action Thriller that Sets the Bar High,"Die Hard, released in 1988, is an explosive rollercoaster ride that sets the benchmark for action thrillers. From heart-pounding moments to unforgettable one-liners, this film is an adrenaline-fueled spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Bruce Willis delivers a career-defining performance as the iconic John McClane, a New York cop caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper during a Christmas party. Willis effortlessly blends vulnerability with sheer determination, making McClane a relatable and immensely likable protagonist. His quick wit and resourcefulness add an extra layer of charm to this character, making him a true action hero for the ages. The film's pacing is impeccable, ensuring that there is never a dull moment. The tension builds gradually, as McClane finds himself outnumbered and outgunned against the ruthless terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, portrayed masterfully by the late Alan Rickman in his breakout role. Rickman's portrayal is chilling, as he exudes intelligence and sophistication while remaining utterly menacing. Die Hard's screenplay is expertly crafted, with sharp dialogue and a well-structured plot that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The action set-pieces are jaw-dropping, with director John McTiernan's meticulous attention to detail evident in every explosive sequence. The film's iconic moments, such as McClane's daring leap off the Nakatomi Plaza rooftop or his brutal cat-and-mouse encounter with Gruber, have become legendary within the genre. The supporting cast also shines, with standout performances from Bonnie Bedelia as McClane's estranged wife Holly, Reginald VelJohnson as the sympathetic Sergeant Al Powell, and Alexander Godunov as the formidable henchman Karl. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their characters, elevating the overall quality of the film. While Die Hard may be over three decades old, its impact on the action genre remains unparalleled. Its influence can be seen in countless films that followed, making it a true game-changer in the industry. The film's ability to blend intense action with genuine emotional stakes is a testament to its enduring appeal. In conclusion, Die Hard is a classic that continues to entertain and captivate audiences to this day. Its stellar performances, thrilling action, and well-crafted screenplay make it a must-watch for any fan of the genre. With its unforgettable characters and iconic moments, Die Hard has solidified its place in cinematic history. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman is electric, creating a dynamic cat-and-mouse game that keeps you hooked until the very end."
Die Hard (1988),Classic 80s action flick still holds up,"A friend rented out a theater the week before Christmas for a big screen viewing of this holiday classic (I dressed up like a minor character Uli) and it was fantastic to get to see this on the big screen once again and with an audience, which I hadn't experienced since high school when I saw it in the theater with my dad back when the movie first came out. The crowd was filled with quite a few twenty-somethings who'd never seen the film before (which seems unbelievable to this old Gen-Xer) but that made it even more fun to experience the film with an audience laughing and reacting to all the right parts in this almost 40-year-old movie! Everyone laughed at Theo and Karl betting in the background whether Mr. Takagi could give up the computer passcode or when Asian terrorist Uli takes a candy bar out of the display case. You could feel the audience squirm as John McClane pulled glass out of his feet. They laughed at all the right parts and cheered at all the right moments. It reminded me of how movies are best enjoyed as a communal experience. When DIE HARD first came out, everyone rolled their eyes at Bruce Willis being an action hero. Up until that point, action heroes were musclebound unstoppable he-men along the lines of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. Sure there were some non-musclebound ones too, like Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford, but they were certainly not comedians, which is what Bruce Willis was primarily known for at this time. Before DIE HARD, he was really only known for the hit TV series MOONLIGHTING (if you haven't seen it, it's on Hulu right now) and one Blake Edwards comedy (which wasn't a box office hit). The studio originally offered the part of McClane to Stallone and Schwarzenegger, but the film is a classic because of Willis. He made McClane a vulnerable character, who does get hurt and who could be killed. Willis eventually became an unstoppable action hero like Sly and Arnold, which may be lost on audiences watching this film for the first time now, but back then, Willis was just that goofy guy from TV trying the best he could to save people from bad guys. But I haven't said anything about DIE HARD itself. Everyone knows the story, so I won't summarize it here, but if you somehow have never seen it before, stop what you're doing right now and watch it! Bruce Willis is effortlessly funny, vulnerable, and heroic all at the same time, which is a nice contrast to most action heroes of the 80s who would only wisecrack one-liners and would never dare to be self-deprecating. Though as great as Willis is, Alan Rickman steals every scene he's in as lead bad guy Hans Gruber. He gets some great lines and character touches from the script, like complimenting Mr. Takagi on his suit or when he pretends to be a hostage, but it's Rickman's refined air that elevates the film. The class Rickman brings to his character is a fun contrast to Willis' blue-collar hero. And what a killer supporting cast, that includes Reginald VelJohnson as Sgt. Al Powell, Paul Gleason playing another jerk, this time the clueless Deputy Police Commissioner, William Atherton as a nasty TV reporter, Hart Bochner as a coke-snorting executive, Alexander Gudunov as terrorist Karl, the great Al Leong (you've seen him in just about every iconic 80s action film), Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as Agents Johnson and Johnson, and De'voreaux White as Argyle, who I don't remember from anything else, but who was apparently in THE BLUES BROTHERS and TRESPASS when I looked him up on IMDB. DIE HARD is a a witty and clever script from Steven E. De Souza and Jeb Stuart, who both mostly write passable dreck unless their films were made by solid directors like Walter Hill (48HRS), Andrew Davis (THE FUGITIVE), or John McTiernan here with DIE HARD, so I'm giving McTiernan credit to making this film what it is. Credit also has to go to ace cinematographer Jan de Bont, who shot such classics as BLACK RAIN, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and BASIC INSTINCT, and would later go on to direct himself, with SPEED being his one standout film. Top it all off with a memorable score by 80s mainstay composter Michael Kaman (LETHAL WEAPON, THE DEAD ZONE, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, HIGHLANDER, BRAZIL, etc.) and you have the makings for a classic. Overall, DIE HARD is an absolute 80s action classic, and yes, DIE HARD is a Christmas movie!"
Die Hard (1988),Jake perealtas favourite movie,"Die hard is known to be one of the most iconic and revolutionary action movies ever, which is certainly true. It revolutionised the action genre as a whole. And it was a pretty well made action movie at that. It definitely wasn't the flawless movie that everyone makes it out to be. Alan Rickman as Hans grubber Is a phenomenal preformance and deserves to go down as one of the best villian preformance. However I can't say Bruce Willis gave that great a preformance. I believe as a result started the whole genre of average action movies with lackluster acting. Was a good movie but nothing special. 8/10."
Die Hard (1988),"""Yippee-ki-yay""","This is a classic action movie that I have watch and is enjoyable. I do like how it's about a cop have to go against a terrorist group in a skyscraper. The movie is build up really well by introducing each of the characters and who they are. I really enjoyed each of the characters like John McClane, Al Powell, and Argyle who have fun personality to them and have development. Also, the acting is done really well by each of the actors and it looks like they have a fun time in the movie. The villains are also pretty great with them being threating and the performance by each one of them. The action are both enjoyable and suspenseful with John fighting against the villain and him trying to survive in the movie. He comes up with a lot of good ideas in order to survive and is pretty smart throughout. It also gets thrilling when the explosion happened and it looks great. Overall its a fun movie to watch on Christmas."
Die Hard (1988),The movie that made Bruce Willis an action star!,"Die Hard is the perfect late 80's action film with great villains, plenty of action, and solid dialogue from our hero. It's everything you want in a Summer action flick even though Die Hard gets the debate that it's actually a Christmas film. Make no mistake this is not a Christmas film but an action film set during Christmas. There should be no debate on this but every Christmas it comes up. Die Hard was the launching pad for making Bruce Willis the action star that he became. In fact I miss action films like this that had plenty of action scenes and explosions that were practical. In todays World we get plenty of CGI fight scenes and over the top action. Die Hard is an action classic from the 80's and gets a very high 9 stars out of 10 from me."
Die Hard (1988),A Quintessential Action Flick,"""Die Hard"" is perhaps the quintessential action film for the Christmas season. Where most Christmas films had opted for the predictably warm and fuzzy, and still often do; director John McTiernan had introduced a landmark infusion of action to the monotone Christmas genre, whilst still managing to keep the Christmas spirit well intact, in its own way. It's become a household classic ever since and conveys the importance of fighting against all odds, even when others doubt you. And that situations are felt most clearly by those with their feet firmly planted on the ground; John McClane's barefooted ordeals reflect this message. It's a celebration of the streetwise and the grounded underdog. Bruce Willis's breakout role as the irreverent and muscled NYPD copper John McClane was eminently career-defining, and quite possibly one of the most strikingly masculine chainsmoking protagonists of film history. A triangle of witty repartees between McClane, Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), and Alan Rickman's flamboyant classically-educated West German villain, Hans Gruber, creates both tension and levity at the film's close-quarters setting, Nakatomi Plaza; as a high-octane game of cat-and-mouse unfolds. You'll also be graced by one of the most iconic one-liner catchphrases; ""Yippee-ki-yay..."" part of cinema lore's lexicon, and for which no caption is needed for further explanation. However a reviewer at the time of release had backhandedly suggested it as a ""nearly perfect movie for our time"", yet designed to appeal to audiences they'd described as ""kidults""-adults with the mindset of children. Nonetheless, McTiernan masterfully combines brains, heart, and brawn in thrillingly explosive action sequences and soulful character development whilst not granting any character the privileges of infallibility or invulnerability. The film combines three subplots to form the overall plot meaning there's plenty going on at any one time and a lot of reasons to stay invested in this film for its full runtime, and to prompt repeat viewings. Deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017. An all-round blast. 8.1/10."
Die Hard (1988),The best action movie to watch either on Christmas or anytime!,"After watching this film with my family of four; my Mum, Dad, Brother Jordy & me for the first time on Christmas Eve here's my spoiler-free review of the original Die Hard! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments of watching it and my Conclusion/rating! Bruce Willis stars in this action thriller that still holds up 35 years later, this was Alan Rickman's first movie he played the bad guy Hans Gruber we still miss the beloved actor to this day R. I. P. The action scenes & special effects are so cool and entertaining, even though this film was set during Christmas time it's not a Christmas movie it was released in Australia back on October 6! Overall It's going to be very interesting to watch the other 3 Die Hard sequels I don't think I'll watch Die Hard 5 but I look forward to it! That's why I'm giving this an 8/10! I enjoyed this so much that I'm excited to see the next films! Merry Christmas everyone! ;-)"
Die Hard (1988),"Welcome to the party, Pal.","Action, check. Christmas themes, check. Realistic action hero, check. Man, if it wasn't for Die Hard, action movies would have never evolved.

Die Hard (1988),"""Yippee ki yay, motherf#&ker!""","FILM: 10/10. Die Hard, a film that needs no introduction, is one of those rare action gems that effortlessly earns top marks in my book. From characters to performances, it's a cinematic masterpiece. Bruce Willis is an absolute blast, seamlessly blending action and comedy while embodying the everyman charm of his character. His improvised wisecracks hit the mark, adding an authentic layer of humour that elevates the film to legendary status. Alan Rickman, the epitome of class, crafts a three-dimensional action movie villain, a worthy adversary to Willis. Not to be overshadowed, Reginald VelJohnson owns his role with confidence, delivering classic lines that linger long after the credits roll. While Bonnie Bedelia has her moments, she's somewhat underutilised in this ensemble cast. Yet, the film's template for crafting a thrilling, smart, and endlessly entertaining action flick is unparalleled, inspiring countless imitators over three decades. Action and drama are seamlessly woven together, hitting all the right beats. The film's quotability is off the charts, a testament to razor-sharp writing and John McTiernan's directorial finesse. From start to finish, not a single misstep occurs. The cast and crew flawlessly deliver this bonafide classic, making its healthy runtime breeze by. Die Hard is the Christmas movie that never fails to grace my screen each year, marking the true start of the festive season. Now that Hans Gruber has had his fall, Christmas can officially begin, and the tradition of revisiting this cinematic masterpiece continues unabated.

Die Hard (1988),The greatest Christmas movie,"The 80s was peak time for action movies and action movie stars. Die Hard is certainly on of the greatest 80s action movies, possibly one of the greatest ever action movies, definitely the greatest Christmas movie and perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a movie about love, friendship, brotherhood, forgiveness, reconciliation and enough C4 to warp Arnold Schwarzenegger. There's Rudolph and Frostie, mulled wine and a nice aged Brie, Christmas music and presents galore. One present is the surprise gift of Bruce Willis as an action star. Bit of a gamble at the time and it worked out as wonderfully as a home baked mince pie. Another gift was the sight of Alan Rickman making his big screen debut and absolutely smashing out the greatest villain in Hollywood history. The dialogue is quotable, the action terrific, the characters are either likeable or detestable exactly as they're supposed to be and I absolutely defy anyone to watch Die Hard and not try to walk around on the rug, barefoot and make fists with your toes. Anyone who says this isn't a Christmas movie is like the product of an unholy union of Ebeneezer Scrooge and the grinch. Beyond the obvious Christmas themes this movie was way ahead of its time in exploring capitalism, the media and US foreign policy and its more of a Christmas tradition in my house than Turkey."
Salaar (2023),Very Interesting Story and suspens is still there in this movie.,At start of this movie it might look fake and over fear of Deva in the mind of people's. But after interval and till end of this part I realised that The Fear Is very very Real. And All starcast Did more than Expectations. Story of this movie is mind blowing within one single watch of this movie we can't understand it. Anyone who loves this kind of movies they should watch this movie Twice. I promise your your money will not be wasted. It will worth watching this movie Twice and It will be very easy to understand its next part. Vardha's Patience is at another level even he is son of King. Sruti can be better.
Salaar (2023),Not a good movie/ The worst movie,For a starter normally there should be a difference between super hero movie and action movie. Now this movie this movie breaks that barrier where he literally obiletrates everyone with unreasonable fight like every bad guy (goons) will have Parkinsons (disease that makes people tremble all the time) every damn time when someone mentions about khansar or the seal . There is no emotions in hero's face we literally can't say either he is angry or normal or just bad acting. The fights are really boring. As a conclusion a bad dragging storyline with nothing to expect in the second part rather than another boring meaningless fight. Movie name should be low budget Maptain America.
Salaar (2023),Career waste of Prabhas,"If I say correclty Salaar is the son who born for KGF from Bahubali. Director glorifying Prabhas as an extra ordinarily strong man who can able to fight alone with the best army troops of seven or eight nuclear countries. No goosebump scenes,No sensible story,No romance,No good songs,No dance. Prabhas first cuts off the hand and then chops off the head of a villain in the middle of a fully armoured Military force with in a court room and neither the military nor the other villains move a single finger against him. With just one shoot they could have ended him and that would have been a relax for the audience from this torture. When they are sent to kill all along prabhas,Prabhas demands a tattoo artist to do tattooing a symbol in his arm by standing near the sharpness of the villain's big knief. Without any doubt I can say that Prasanth Neel's story collection has ended with KGF1 and I strongly suggest that no one should watch his films by hype and If you do, you will repent like me later."
Salaar (2023),Too lengthy and over hyped,"Too much waste of time for the projection for the hero. And he does almost nothing great. 1st half was good created lot of curiosity but 2nd part falls flat. No story revealed, seems like Director wanted to drag it more longer than TV serials like a chewing gum. Was expecting a lot from secong half, but alas . Throughout the movie you get reminded of KGf because of the same type of screen play , kids talking about the hero and group trying to entice him . Even the music feels like the same at some parts. It's better to avoid it in theatres and watch it in OTT as there is nothing so special in the this part."
Salaar (2023),"An Action Saga Which Brings Back The Euphoria Of PRA-BOSS,With A World Building...","So I Finally Watched One Of The Most Anticipated Movie 'Salaar' Starring REBEL STAR Prabhas,Prithviraj Sukuruman In Main Leads Written And Directed By Prashant Neel.

Salaar (2023),Way to start the year...,"Personal Thoughts: If you aren't too nit-picky or judgemental of the movies you watch, it'd be easy to enjoy Salaar. The beginning was a bit shaky and had the audience rightfully confused for the first hour or so, just waiting anxiously for answers, but the answers themselves more than made up for all of it. And don't get me wrong: being confused doesn't equal couldn't enjoy. I still found the beginning fun to watch, but I liked it a lot more when things started to piece together. What really brought me in was the dynamic between Vardha and Deva, which I won't talk too much about to avoid spoiling anything. From the eyes of someone who absolutely loved KGF 1 & 2, I say this movie wasn't a disappointment in the slightest. At the very least, it has me looking forward to the next part. The acting, story, and characters made this a great watch. Definitely one of the best movies made in 2023, despite it's rocky start. In summary, if you love action-packed movies that feature loyalty in its realest sense and have a main character that's easy to adore, a movie that's filled with emotion and suspense, a movie that's close to three hours yet has you wanting more at the end, Salaar might just fit your description. Again, I'm not too picky about my entertainment, but I can tell when a movie's not good, and judging by this review, you already know what I think of Salaar P1 (it's been a while since I've seen a movie that had me this drawn in). Can't wait for part two!"
Salaar (2023),"An Epic Tale of Action, Drama, and Sequel Promise.","Salaar delivers a typical South Indian movie experience with intense action, a powerful hero, and a compelling storyline. Prabhas commands the screen effortlessly, complemented by Shruti Hassan's impressive contribution. The film's action sequences are a standout. The storyline, while sharing similarities with the successful KGF, introduces its own unique twists and turns, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. In essence, Salaar is not just a film; it's an immersive journey into the heart of South Indian cinema, where larger-than-life characters, compelling storytelling, and jaw-dropping action converge. Salaar part-1 seems to set the stage for an exciting second part, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre."
Salaar (2023),A good comeback movie for King!,"I'm not sure why a few people are so hellbent on giving poor ratings for this movie! Salaar is one of the best action movies I have ever seen in 2023. Though the stroy is lengthy & the director did spend much time on providing elevations to our hero whenever he got a chance, I still felt that they were kind of good & some of them were on point. I hope we will get to see more from Prithvi & other important characters in the second part. It's definitely a feast for Prabhas's fans & I think he did his best for this role. It's a good story with a few twits, definitely worthy of our time! I'll be waiting for second part!"
Salaar (2023),"It's a superb mass movie, so don't expect anything else","This is a superb tollywood action movie and don't understand why anyone should judge it from any other lense. Prashanth Neel goes one step further than KGF. Simply loved Prabhaas. Especially after the Adipurush fiasco. This is his home ground and he should stick to it. Really liked how the fictional city of Khansaar is created with lots of adrenaline pumping scenes. Compared to KGF, the plot and storyine is given more attention. Characters apart from the lead(Salaar), have been carefully casted. Each one is equally important and does justice to his part. Towards the end, they have done an excellent job at creating a premise for Salaar part 2. Eagerly waiting for it. If you liked KGF/Leo/Vikram, then there are high chances that you will like this one too. Go for it."
Salaar (2023),BLOCKBUSTER,"If you really want to enjoy this movie , then forget about KGF or any of the old references like Uppgramm whatever. Just focus on the story which has a lot to offer specially with the flow of events and twists in the end. If you thought this movie was bad, its probably because you had way too high expectations. I read multiple reviews where people mentioned about the heroes using knives , swords etc. Instead of guns. For godsake , its a South Indian movie which usually has over the top action scenes with knives and swords and that was clearly evident from the trailer - its not a surprise package in the theatre for people to be disappointed about action scenes - if you have problems with over the top scenes , just don't waste your money watching it in theatre - BUT IF YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND WITH ZERO BIAS , THIS MOVIE WILL ENTERTAIN YOU FOR SURE."
The Family Plan (2023),Decent action comedy flick with a bit of True Lies and Family vacation.,"3.5 out of 5 stars. The Family Plan is a pretty fair action comedy film that has a family road trip with Mark Wahlberg having a secret life before them. As he was once a rogue agent and trained to kill. And a bunches of henchmen are after him. The plot is okay which involves Mark Wahlberg trying to connect with his teen kids and trying to break the news to his wife the truth. The action sequences are okay and entertaining. Mark Wahlberg did great in the role. The rest of the cast did okay as well. The villain felt underdeveloped. The humor can be cheesy with Mark Wahlberg and the baby fighting with the baby just giggling through tough situations. Overall, it was a pretty fair film with plenty of fun action but cheesy humor."
The Family Plan (2023),An enthralling tale of a retired government hitman navigating family life,"Diving into the intricate life of a retired government hitman trying to balance family and a covert past, this film captivates with a compelling narrative, earning a solid 9/10. However, a regrettable choice in portraying antagonists solely as individuals of African, Asian, and Italian descent introduces an uncomfortable racial dynamic. The lack of diversity in this aspect mars an otherwise outstanding plot. With a touch of sarcasm, one can't help but wonder if the filmmakers forgot to include Latino adversaries, leaving the audience questioning the film's inclusivity. Despite this misstep, the gripping storyline manages to keep viewers engaged, making it a commendable cinematic experience."""
The Family Plan (2023),Spy comedy,"One of the Christmas event is to watch this movie at home! Although it's an Apple TV movie but the cast is good. The plot is about a normal man who have a good family and 3 kids, while it was gradually found out that he has a dark past as an assassin of the government! He was found out by the ex colleagues and needed to fight back without informing his family. The runway and fight scenes are good and there are places to laugh, such as throwing away all their phones! The baby is very cute as well! But the character of Maggie Q is not good and the final boss is his father. The plot is all u can expected and watching it would be a good way to spend your time."
The Family Plan (2023),Better than I expected,"This deserves better ratings. It's at least a 7/10. The script is very good. The acting is very good. The comedic elements are very good. The directing is excellent. Overall, this is a fun action comedy worth watching. I'm very picky and this did have a few minor issues but way fewer than most of the stuff being made these days. If you have an overinflated sense of superiority and you like to think that your criticisms matter more than the efforts of the people who put in the effort to create a decently entertaining movie, then don't watch this. As other reviewers have said, grab some popcorn and enjoy this movie."
The Family Plan (2023),Utter Crap,"If you've read any short synopsis of this movie, you don't need to see it. The story begins with an inexplicable set-up (some sort of privatized witness protection program?), kicks off with an unexplained plot twist (why are the bad guys after him NOW?), and proceeds through unbelievable series of public shootouts across the country (at no point across the country were the authorities alarmed or mobilized?). I wish I had these two hours back. If you get tricked into sitting through this garbage, bring a good book. The story will not require more than about three percent of your attention to keep up with the action."
The Family Plan (2023),A surprisingly good film.,"The wife put this film on in the background whilst I was doing something else. 20 minutes in I surprised us both by suggesting this was a Marky Marky I'd actually like to watch. So we saved it for a day later, and here I am giving it 8 stars. Nothing ground breaking about the script. But refreshingly warm and charming. There's some great hits by the stunt team. Lots of great little jokes to be found. Max the baby is a stand out character. When I see this film get slammed by the critics, but a film like Extraction 2 with an even weaker story. I start to wonder if I should believe their reviews anymore. So I'm writing this review. If you considering watching it, go in with no expectation and you'll have a great time."
The Family Plan (2023),"Corny, quirky, action and family love","Oh come on. Some people took this movie way too seriously with their ridiculously low ratings. It is what it is with no pretentious ""deeper meaning"". This was a fun ride. A goofy at times holiday treat. Yes, you could probably predict some of what was coming, but so what. The cast was great. And so many other fun characters in the entire movie. The baby was so cute and hysterical at times. This is a sit back with popcorn and laugh movie. If you just want to relax and enjoy a movie that is not stuffed with obligatory ""stuff"" and divisive messaging, this is it. It is entertainment. Don't take it too seriously."
The Family Plan (2023),Messy Action and Weak Story...,"""The Family Plan"" is just another weak action-comedy, with very low quality on ideas, originality, and development, as well as the cheesy and non-organic love connection between the main characters. The story is simply about a family, and a father that hides his dark, bloody past. When things are getting out of control for him, he has to take the mission in his own hands and hide his true identity from his family. First, I had an impression that this was going to be a fun comedy that can live on its action, but turned out to be an unoriginal flick that really looks like it's written be Ai. First I got to mention the characters. I remembered maybe half of the names, because I never get connected that much (Besides the father, Sean, the main hero) that by the way carried the cast mostly. Sean as a character himself was interesting, but unfortunately not so interesting as I expected him to be. The villain he had to fight came out of nowhere and felt totally out of place, in my opinion. His backstory came more on the end, too, and I wished maybe a little peak before. Sean's wife (The Mother) was fun, yet she was very plastic and the actress could be more of a food commercial women. The kids are the most predictable characters, easily comparable to kids from other family comedies. It's always a computer dude, a weirdo and some little kid. A few of the action sequences were acceptable, yet not so great as I expected. Generic and predictable, it tried to make things interesting but ended with a cheesy cliché that should never took have place. I got really surprised over the camera filming and overall quality, and sometimes I think that not only Apple sponsored this movie, but helped to make it with their cameras. I don't know if I liked it or not, it was a weird feeling in the filming, I don't know, something was just strange. The movie was carried by nice soundtrack, as well as nice suspense score that was good, but some of the action was so lame that the music was wasted for nothing, and that's bad, because they could use it for something much better. In the end, this is an Ai-Script, bad, plastic acting, as well as uninteresting and forgettable action. The rating was saved some more by a few good sequences and nice soundtrack overall."
The Family Plan (2023),"Oh my god, we're British.....","Dan Morgan loves his quiet suburban life as a devoted husband, father of three and successful car salesman. But that's only half the story. Decades earlier, he was an elite government assassin tasked with eliminating the world's deadliest threats. When enemies from his past track him down, Dan packs his family into their minivan and takes off on an impromptu cross-country road trip to Las Vegas. Determined to protect his family....while treating them to the vacation of a lifetime.....Dan must put his long-dormant skills into action, without revealing his true identity..... Have you ever wondered what would happen if a studio like Apple spent loads of money on a film that was True Lies mixed with National Lampoons Vacation? Well wonder no more, because here it is, and no one asked for it, and because of that, it's pretty enjoyable fluff. Wahlberg spends his time not saying 'Hey Bro?', but doing that weird thing he does by speaking a sentence like he's asking a question. Bad guys find out about him, and try to kill him, but there's a twist!! For no good reason, the main bad guy is his dad, and that gets explained near the end by good old Basil Exposition. Maggie Q plays the Oddjob of the movie, and the whole movie is throwaway fluff that streaming channels produce that are specifically aimed at people who spend half of their time on their phone whilst watching the film, because you could go out for twenty minutes, come back, and not miss anything at all. The cast are fine, there's a pretty good set piece in a supermarket, and it all looks very nice. But I like Wahlberg, so what can you do?"
The Family Plan (2023),It's a really a family plan,"""The Family Plan"" is a heartwarming comedy that explores the chaos and joy that ensue when a well-intentioned family attempts to execute a foolproof plan to reconnect. The ensemble cast delivers standout performances, with each actor bringing a unique charm to their roles. Emily Thompson shines as the determined matriarch, balancing humor and vulnerability with ease.""The Family Plan"" is a delightful cinematic experience that will leave audiences both laughing and reflecting on the importance of family. Whether you're part of a close-knit family or simply seeking an uplifting escape, ""The Family Plan"" is a must-watch that celebrates the beautiful chaos of familial love. It's so good movie."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),This is what a monster film should be,"Compared to the mediocre American Godzilla films, Godzilla Minus One outshines them in every aspect. The character development is some of the best in a monster movie, the audience can actually connect properly to the human characters in a way that nicely drives the film overall and there are never any dialogue scenes that are a slog to get through. The Godzilla destruction and special FX are also top notch, although there are only a handful of action scenes through the film they are masterfully crafted as Godzilla fights the films protagonists and destroys his way through Japan. Definitely one of the best monster films in recent years."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),An impressive film to say the least,"I have never seen a single movie with subtitles in it. I have seen a couple of the recent Godzilla MonsterVerse movies. While I don't have any problems with those films, I am honestly indifferent toward them. Honestly going into this movie I had zero expectations. Didn't know what to expect. In the end, I was...impressed. The story itself does a surprisingly good job at being self contained. It keeps itself within the borders of Japan. It also take place after the events of World War II, which provide interesting backstories for our characters dealing with grief, trauma, regret from the war itself and how to overcome it. It just happens to also have the added threat of Godzilla in the midst, which was handled really well... For being a 15 Million Dollar budgeted movie, the effects and cinematography are really well done. The way they animated Godzilla in this movie is impressive. I think if you want to take big budget action blockbusters like Godzilla, Transformers, etc., and make them good, having less is more, and in this movies case, it's better. A really good movie overall."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),It feels way better than it is,"The story isn't ground breaking. The effects can be kind of janky at times. The acting really funny - it harkens back to old Japanese films where they exaggerate the characters' expressions. Yet, I was engrossed for the full 2 hours. The director focused on a story and unlike Hollywood for the last couple of years, gosh was it refreshing not to be preached to or watch a 2 hour political advertisement. The entire movie is subtitled, I know it's not for everyone. So be aware. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. A love story that unfolds behind the backdrop of monster rampaging through Tokyo. Marvelous."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),GODZILLA MINUS 1,"I went to see this movie expecting not a lot. But then when the film finished, I was lost for words, it was incredible and I mean it. This movie came with loads of different things such as, scary scenes really sad moments and also real happy moments, ( and of course, jawdropping moments) The acting in the film were awesome. The subtitles were clear with no delays
And best of all, godzilla was super scary as should be. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone ,even people who are not really fans of godzilla,
Even though the movie is in Japanese it is still incredible for others who speak different languages. Also I hope to see a godzilla minus 1 part 2
Especially after the ending 😉"
Godzilla Minus One (2023),Is 'Godzilla Minus One' worth your time and money?,"This short review is to help readers living in Western countries decide whether Godzilla Minus One is worth watching. There's three things you need to know beforehand so you won't be disappointed: 1) The movie is in Japanese but has English subtitles. 2) CGI is pretty bad (although I actually prefer costumes and prostethics more than 100% computer graphics. I'd rather Godzilla looks like this than the CGI in 'The Marvels' for example). 3) The movie is dialogue heavy. Godzilla scenes are few and far between. That's how they kept a low budget - by giving you 5 - 10 minute snippets of Godzilla and then it's back to lengthy scenes of dialogue in Japan. Wrong expectations are probably the biggest reason for how divided the audience reaction has been. Keep in mind that this movie had a 9-point-something score on IMDb before it was released in Western Countries. By East-Asian standards this is one of the best movies of all time. So there's a clear distinction between how the movie has been received in different regions of the world. Being from the UK, my biggest gripe with Godzilla Minus One is that with a $15 million budget you would expect it to have far more substance than style. I was expecting top tier, edge-of-your-seat drama to compensate for what the movie lacked visually. But that wasn't the case. The plot was incredibly basic and predictable. It thinks it's deeper than it is. So overall you're left with a movie that doesn't look great, doesn't showcase Godzilla doing much (just slowly walking around, stepping on people, knocking over buildings and hurling ships) and doesn't have much substance either. On the below scale... 5. Absolute must watch in theaters. 4. Worth the ticket price 3. Shortlist and wait for streaming. 2. Could miss it entirely. 1. Complete waste of time. Avoid. ...it gets a 2.5 from me."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),Much better than your average money grab Godzilla movie,"It was so great to finally see a Godzilla movie that held true to the original Godzilla theme. Godzilla is supposed to represent nuclear weapons and the impact that these weapons and the violence of the second World War had on the people of Japan. This theme was powerfully demonstrated in this film. Aside from the obvious destruction and trauma caused by the monster, the film also touched on other aspects of war that had an impact on the people of Japan, such as dying and living honorably as well as rebuilding a nation. Additionally, you did not feel that there was glorification of the monster or the war, however, respect was shown for both. I would highly encourage anybody who has not seen this movie and is fond of Godzilla or monster movies in general to go see this movie (in theatres preferred!)."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),Powerful,"What can I say other than...Well Done! On a teeny budget of $15M this Toho Studio movie lacks for nothing. The action kicks off right away with a Japanese pilot touching down on a chunky island airstrip. He's questioned as to why he has returned (was supposed to be a kamikaze mission, I think. I watched a no-subtitles version). Next scene, BOOM, Godzilla! Note: Gojira = gorilla + kujira/whale. There's plenty of human drama laced into the story. The toddler gives an award-worthy performance. My goodness, when her face crumples up in a sob, you'd have to be a block of wood not to shed a tear yourself. It's refreshing to see a movie stay period-accurate; notice that all the scenes of decision-making and naval heroism are all-male. Women play a role in the plot - the main character's life is saved by a woman - just not in the attack against the monster. My criticisms of the movie are as follows:
***MILD SPOILERS***
(1) There are too many rousing speeches rallying the spirit of the troops. Godzilla conveniently disappears for large chunks of the run time. (2) One consequential scene that happens midway thru the film gets undone in the ending. That felt cheap. Overall, RECOMMENDED. Note: A second release of this movie called ""Godzilla Minus 1/Minus Color"" will be coming out in mid-January. Black & White, baby!"
Godzilla Minus One (2023),Exceptional movie Godzilla Minus One just gets it right 👌,"Godzilla Minus One 👏👏👏 It's going straight into my IMDb as a 10/10 (recency bias score, as initial watch experience...on a more critical analysis could be 9.6 to 9.8) If a movie can make you feel for the characters and poke at the emotions of an emotionless person like myself, yeah, it's getting that big recommendation from me. I loved the intensity of the music and the monster Godzilla scenes, done so well, yet it's actually not just those big scenes that do it for this one. The story, the writing (subtitles), but how they dealt with some heavy sentiments, I thought they did an incredible job. Well done. I even liked the ""feel"" of the movie, the texture of it, the way that Godzilla himself actually looks a bit funny 😅 it worked. The sense of scale also worked, this Godzilla looked MASSIVE, enough to make you tremble, that sense of hopeless impending devastation, and how that was tackled, as well as some darker, sadder emotions that the movie touches on, yep, fair play, you guys got me on this one. 👏 Highly recommend, catch in the cinema for the SOUNDS and scale of it, but I think it could still work on the small screen if you're waiting for that. Loved this movie."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),The best blockbuster of the year,"In ""Godzilla Minus One,"" the film deeply explores the emotional side, portraying a kamikaze soldier facing the consequences of World War II and Godzilla. The dramatic depth is remarkable, delving into post-war traumas in an impactful way. Unlike North American versions of ""Godzilla,"" it adds complexity to the characters, enriching the viewer's experience. The film's execution highlights the strength of Asian cinema, surpassing Hollywood in many aspects. The Godzilla scenes are impressive, offering a unique sensory experience. The action sequences, especially the destruction of a major city, effectively convey the villain's relentless threat. ""Godzilla Minus One"" indirectly challenges prejudices against Asian films, providing a positive experience for audiences weary of American blockbusters. On the downside, a slight negative point is noted in the conclusion, where there's an effort to appeal to the Western audience with a more ""Hollywood-esque"" ending, which felt somewhat forced but didn't diminish the film's overall impact."
Godzilla Minus One (2023),Perfection,"10/10, not only the best movie of 2023, but in my opinion probably the best Godzilla film ever put to film. For a budget that looks incredibly budgeted and small compared to Hollywood's recent $200-300 Million bloated budgets and limitations of practical and visual effects, this movie absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Toho made the right choice to go back to basics and make Godzilla the ultimate destructive antagonistic force of nature and bringing back the monster-horror aspect that's very much needed in these movies. Like the 1954 original, the dark and serious tone works beautifully and incredibly effectively in conveying what the scene needs to. And whether on screen, off screen or implied, Godzilla's mere presence conveys that tone of dread and terror, truly retaining back the title of King of the Monsters. And the characters! It's been a long time since we've had characters in these films that we could actually care for, let alone give any interest or sympathy towards. Minus One's characters grow and are fleshed out throughout the story, and the context of being a kamakazi pilot in a post-WWII 1940's Japan. It asks questions of the value of life and vengeance for those who've lost theirs, and the guilt of actions, what we do and don't do. This film reflects back to a conflicted and broken time, but one inhabited by good and united people choosing to give their lives for something greater. It's truly a relieving and hopeful sight for what makes great cinema through the infinite muddled assembly line of cheap, poorly made, factory-produced content called film. Forget the multiverse movies, give us more of this!"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Indy or back to the future?,"Well, seeing young Indiana Jones was very good. Technology is amazing, that makes every actor and actresses eternal! I love that! As a movie, you know ther care lots of unlogical things but this is Indiana Jones, who cares? I have to say Sicilia scenes, from beginning to end, just perfect! Full action is over there. I love also time travel section.. . Phoebe waller Bridge is sooo cool and so suitable for her role in this movie. I hope this series can continue in some way. Final is also so sweet. Seeing Marion was good. I love happy endings. Anyway I love everything about movie, technology, characters, scenes, places. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones, I am sure you will love this too."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Shiny Harrison Ford,"A mixed bag of a movie. It was okay in some places but there is a disconnect between what is said and what happens. Indi can jump between vehicles but has trouble climbing up a rock-face. Is he too old for this or not? Characters are introduced that are allegedly a large part of Indi's life but he doesn't have a connection to them at all; at least it doesn't seem like it. Helena is painfully unlikeable and seems more like the villain of the piece instead of the deuteragonist. Just let Indi live in the past. It's all he's ever wanted. The de-aging is passable at times, such as in long shots or when seen in relative darkness, but can falter from time to time. Hearing 80 year-old Harrison Ford's voice coming out of 46 year-old Indiana Jones is incredibly distracting. Sallah should have been in more of the film instead of just as a glorified cameo. Killing of Indi's son was the best thing that could have happened to that character."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Better than Crystal Skulls... if you're patient,"Good to see Jones back in the saddle. Pacing was a tad drawn out, making the sequences feel a unnecessarily tedious. The writers obviously didn't know how to write a building historical interest into the show, so it fell back to overly long 'action' scenes without meaningful ties to the point of it all along the way. The new female co-star is not very appealing to either look at or listen to. They tried to hard to make her 'edgy' and she wound up just a straight-up, plain b*tch. Worth a watch on your platform of choice despite it all because the show winda out to a pretty good ending, for which a grudging nod can be given."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Just as the story continues,"I don't understand those who criticise this great movie!! Indiana is just old and this movie was not about him! But he still got the lead shared with Helena what makes this movie very enjoyable and fun! The story that started with him was just like any Indiana Jones movies and the overlap to his old him was smart created. The actions in this movie may be a bit too much, specially the one who got cuffed under water by a kid with no remorse! The bad guy is in this movie also very bad and killed without remorse too. But hey, this is a Indiana Jones movie. The last one, but he did it in my opinion really great, the story, the plot, it was really enjoyable! What was also great are the old characters like Sallah and his wife... Still the same but older... Great Movie!!"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Well done Team Indy,"Films may not have necessarily been better in the past, but the standout productions of the 80s and 90s often shared a common trait - a significant investment of heart. Despite varying budgets or circumstances. The film industry back then was perhaps as calculating as today, aiming to at least double every dollar spent. However, the caution in film making and storytelling today, together with the fact that most people now consider themselves hardcore critics first, rather than an audience, contributes to a scarcity of heartfelt and those charming imperfections in movies. The things we loved about Indiana Jones: Indy clumsily beating up Nazis and creepy Indian cult members over some archaeological artifact. Accompanied by John Williams' brilliant melodies, occasionally a little bit too loud and tiresome score and dialogue but... Nevertheless, it remains a masterpiece-ingenious, entertaining, and delightfully imperfect. No need to compare this final chapter to its predecessors. Streamed in 4K during a time when many believe VHS was an ancient STD, I must say, the movie sent me away on delightful nostalgic trip. The story and the actors successfully brought back some of that wonderful 'heart' from the past. A more than worthy ending. Well done James Mangold, and thank you Harrison Ford for spoiling us with great entertainment throughout the decades."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Films like these are SO ridiculous! Too many unrealistic situations.,"This movie feels very much like it's shot mostly in front of green/blue screen. I didn't know three wheeled mopeds performed better than four wheeled old sports cars, and were able to go down stairs effortlessly with three people (250kg) inside. Professional gangsters apparently can't hit a target, with an automatic rifle, from a few meters. He said 3 minute dive, but it was far more than that! Boat scene, after dynamite:
When people are within 100m from you, shooting with a gun, you don't calmy turn your head and back to them, you duck and hide; preferably BEFORE the bullets comes flying. When there is a hurry, why are they ALWAYS so slooooow!? It's just unrealistic and stupid! Who survives hours with a shot to the heart? Well not his friend, he died within seconds. Why would they fly so low, just to get shot at? They were in an airplane for fudge sake! There was no reason for them to drop that much altitude after they regained control. Are all these new movies made for dumb kids (and adults with IQ below 80)? I don't understand. It's not THAT hard to make exactly the same movies, but WITHOUT all the stoopid sht. It's just lazy and it feels like the movie industry is deliberately making bad movies, because I can't accept that they are this stoopid with these kind of budgets."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),Worse than Crystal Skull,"So you're telling me that after Crystal Skull, which was a mess and a bit ridiculous, your next step was this? A movie where Indiana is treated terribly the whole time with bad callbacks and bad pacing. Look we all know Harrison is older and grumpier, but to give him the Luke Skywalker treatment is just bonkers to me. Why are we constantly making movies where we're ruining childhood figures? At this point in my life I would rather see remakes and retellings of these old characters than sequels. All they seem to do is take a beloved figure and ruin who they were with minor callbacks to make you go ""Oh I remember that."" I'd rather see a new Indy with a new adventure in a retelling that pays homage but is brand new. They've been doing it for James Bond all these years, they can do it for Indy. Now that I'm done crying about that, let's get into the movie. Indiana Jones fights Nazis for an old relic that will allow the Nazis to win WW2. All the while his god daughter shows up and robs him, tries to sell off said artifact and then they get into a wacky back and forth that disrespects a beloved character, gives us a new Short Round and is constantly like ""Hey remember how you liked the car chases in the other movies? Well here's 40 of them for not a whole lot of reason."" I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to give it a chance and not feel like I did with the recent Star Wars but Disney can't handle Lucasfilm properties. They can't get out of their own way and this movie is just another failure. At least Crystal Skull attempted to be different and failed that way. This movie tried more of the same with modern tropes that just takes away any enjoyment. PS
The CGI in this movie is also poop and looks worse than Crystal Skull did, you couldn't convince me otherwise."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),A shame,"This movie garnered a whole bunch of criticism and I can see why. If I didn't get Disney + for free I would have never seen this based on all the negative reviews and clips I saw of it. But I DO get D+ for free which this showed up on. So I gave it a try. This is NOT the Indy that we deserved for a final movie. Out of nowhere is introduced a character that is NEVER before mentioned in one of the previous movies and is the most insufferable and annoying person in the whole movie. The action sequences are ok and the music scores are top notch. The acting is also OK. I have to say that any upcoming movies that have Phoebe Waller Bridge as the main draw will not be any temptation for me to go to. She's fairly underwhelming. Overall, the writing and premise of this show are really not that good. As far as storytelling and keeping me 'on the edge of my seat' (a gold standard for keeping your audience engaged) it was never there. I watched the first movie and this last iteration of Indy is such a pale imitation. Why have writers and directors have lost all semblance of creativity lately??"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),So much CGI there are no real stakes,"A sad farewell to Indiana Jones. There is so much CGI going on that the chase scenes mean nothing. Time and time again things happen too conveniently (thanks to the CGI). There are masses of green screen shots which take out the mysticism of the journey. I'd rathe the film was poorly lit but practically shot than all done on a lit set. Plot wise, its too magical and not based in reality enough. We don't want time travel, or multiverses, just go on a good old romping journey to some interesting places. It's not that difficult to write. I think too many people got involved in the story and there were too many things shoehorned in to say farewell to Indiana. Why does this happen to every great franchise?!"
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023),A Solid Farewell To Cinema Legend,"After pre-ordering the DVD from Amazon and diligently avoiding all spoilers until its arrival, I decided to binge the previous 4 Indy movies and then round it off with Dial of Destiny. Overall I thought it was a solid addition to the saga and as a last hurrah for Harrison Ford as Indy, it has a certain poignancy. It mixed familiar character roles seen in the previous films with a new twist that kept things fresh. For example, every Indy movie has a female lead but - recognising Indy is now in his twilight years - rather than having the female lead as the traditional romantic interest riding on Indy's coat tails they have used this character space to introduce a savvy and bold female lead who, for a change, is taking Indy for a ride! The tone of the story is somewhat tragic in parts. What's nice is that the writers and Ford himself haven't shied away from the reality that life is complicated and involves loss, even for heroes. Right from our first sight of the older Indy telling his young neighbours to 'quiet down' to his half hearted retirement do, to Indy's resignation that he belongs in the past more than his present - there is a serious side to the rip roaring adventure; the rather existential theme of Time moving on and leaving us behind. Overall - good classic Indiana Jones action with fresh twists and realistic undertones - all of which add up to a fitting farewell to our whip cracking adventurer!"
The Creator (2023),What a waste of time.,"There comes a movie with which younhave high hopes. This one was such a downer that I almost slipped into depression. This movie had me ask the director ""why"" just why did you do something like this. If you had not something better to do, go and sleep. You'd be better off that ways and so will your audience. Mow coming to the plot. It is so weak that only AI can fix it. Because there is something too wrong with the implementation of the logic and storyline kehne ka mtlb kch bhi ho rha hai bhaiya isse zyada kya kahe k aakhir mein maya zinda hojati h aur Joshua uski chummi le leta h. Creator dharti pe laut jata h aur usi k sath movie ka the end."
The Creator (2023),Great CGI- terrible acting,"Washington cements his reputation as being an awful actor. Who else, but the son of a great actor would get so many chances at big films? Janney is a caricature of herself- overplaying the awful writing tropes- yelling ""mount up!"" Multiple times to her subordinates. The idea of humanizing the robots makes no sense and is inconsistent- going back and forth. The ""surprise"" reveal was so predictable from almost the beginning. All that said, the CGI was outstanding and wasted on this film. I wonder if a rewrite of the script and changing lead actors would be any help- maybe so- but the tropes are all too prevalent."
The Creator (2023),Visually astounding,"A great development in terms of visual effects, ""The Creator"" keeps its audience sticked to the seat by means of action and mystery. No matter how much the storyline resorts to previously set leitmotivs ( the advent of the chosen one; the danger of artificial intelligence; the inhumanity of man), the spectator can do nothing but thank the development of such in this movie. Due to this sort of ""heritage"" the film is easily inserted in Sci-Fi/cyberpunk imagery -what makes it an interesting view for anyone into this kind of worlds. The weakness: perhaps, some storylines lack full development, but are coherently explained by means of flashbacks and resources of the sort. A good movie to let your imagination fly, especially if you love the genre."
The Creator (2023),The Reviews You've Read Are Wrong. The Creator Has a Ton of Heart.,"I feel like many of the reviews from people here went into watching this film expecting to be disappointed. I went in, knowing about a very average reception, and found an altogether enthralling and unexpectedly emotional film at its heart. This film is gorgeous and feels so much more natural than other big-budget SFX of it's calibre. The Creator felt lived-in and gritty. Yes, this can be certainly said of other significant films from over 30 years. But The Creator looks so dense, vibrant and new. I felt the same way I do when I travel to a new country. This was achieved, without a doubt, by director Edwards and DP Fraser desire to find a new way of making a film like this and shooting it guerrilla style, almost like a documentary. I whole-heartedly believe they succeeded in creating a world that felt real. There were some fantastic set-pieces with amazing action that I never felt lost in and nearly every character that we see, apart from the odd grunt, is doing something smart. There's a major battle sequence that just filled me with dread and shocked me with how slow and almost sluggish the battle begins. The story, certainly touched on some familiar beats in retrospect. But in the moment, nearly every chapter of this film kept me guessing as to where it was going and how John David Washington's character, Joshua, was going to do what he needed to do. His performance was robust and wanted what he wanted. ""Alphie"", played by Madeleine Yuna Voyles is a damn marvel. I haven't been so impressed by a child actor in a long time. So, forget about reviews. In fact, forget about this review. Forget about demanding only the best from every film you go and see. Go into it without any expectations. Go along for the ride. I guarantee it'll be an experience that stays with you."
The Creator (2023),"Visually Stunning, best of 2013, but.. that's it.","As almost every other reviewer pointed out, the CGI is superb and surely beats Marvel and DC CGI by far. For such a budget, my kudos to the studio, they performed magnificently. Some readers are pointing out Washington's performance, others got offended by the apparent east vs west conflict depicting the west as the bad ones (not assimilating diversity, LOL). All these are not actual flaws. Simply, the story makes absolutely no sense, both on small levels and individual scenes and also in a greater overall scale. Ok, we know this is fiction but, on any version of the future which includes AI, almost nothing of what we see makes sense existing. The writers could use some advice from experts as it seems, it's a ""kids"" vision of an AI dystopia and not a real one. I'm giving it 7/10 as its visually superb, well directed, decently acted but please, put some real effort to the script next time."
The Creator (2023),The Creator review,"It's always worth commending a blockbuster movie that comes from original ideas and concepts and is not part of any IPs and franchises. The Creator is one of many movies that deserve so many praises for its purpose and potential. The greatest strength of this film is the visual elements and world building within it. I don't think I have enough praises and commendations to Gareth Edwards, whose brilliant direction has effortlessly blended breathtaking vistas, meticulously crafted CGI, and outstanding visual spectacle. It's always wonderful to see a talented filmmaker who doesn't hold back in unleashing the full potential in their creativity and visions, in returns giving us unforgettable experiences watching their work. That being said, however, this movie, for all of its' greatness, has few of it flaws While the narrative is indeed original, there are some noticeable cliches and tropes that we might have familiar before, leaving some details in the movie that are predictable. In addition, I think the characters (which included Washington, Chan, and Watanabe's characters) are only made as the means for the advancement of the story and are not characterized with full potential or written as their own character. Overall, having watched this movie, I appreciate what this movie set out to be. We do have Gareth Edwards to thank for his visual brilliance and talent that bring us fruitful results. As I said before, movies that come from the original concept deserve much support in cinema."
The Creator (2023),"A somewhat derivative ""original"" sci-fi film.","Knowing how rare new science fiction movies are, I was interested to see what The Creator (2023) would say about artificial intelligence. Even if we're currently seeing a rise in generative AI tools, the AI in The Creator are more like the replicants in Blade Runner (1982). And while Gareth Edwards hasn't had a lot of movies under his belt, he's proven that he can handle big franchises like Godzilla (2014) and Star Wars (with Rogue One (2016)). Unfortunately, this ""original"" film feels highly derivative of these previous movies in his filmography. Plot-wise, much of The Creator cribs from Rogue One. The big orbiting doomsday device that looms as a threat over key battle sequences gives off big Death Star vibes. That there's a MacGuffin that's supposed to save the world/universe which causes the main character to undergo great sacrifice is yet another parallel that's hard to ignore. Granted, many consider Rogue One to be a great film, so another military sci-fi that copies a lot of elements from it is bound to be great as well. I agree that there were some interesting technology concepts explored in The Creator, but the premise didn't click for me. Maybe the bigger issue I have with this film is how it tells us things we already know. Since it's set in a future version of our world, it just reinforces the fact that the United States can be an imposing military force in Asia for no other reason than to maintain a global domination of military might. As the Vietnam War showed us, the locals who are being targeted by the U. S. military-industrial complex have enough grit and tools to stand up to the oppression of the American military. Overall, its message seems weak despite its impressive visuals. A somewhat derivative ""original"" sci-fi film, I give The Creator 3.5 stars out of 5."
The Creator (2023),Sci-fy dystopian,"The problem is the script, sometimes the narrative is a mish mesh of combat events, the war against A. I. is an endless futility a metaphor the master and slaves rulers and working classes. Reminiscent of the Vietnam Nam war with the Americans against the Asian who support the A. I. bonding with humans. Does ai help the working class people of asian descent? Its a possiblity that its more of the inspiration behind man and computers the danger of A. I. becoming self aware are not really explored. Too bad, the ageless story of a lost love for the protagonist to discover where and whom his lost love is and has become the mystery of the who is the creator of the gifted child who will redeem this world. If you can stay with this film does get better. Its not cheap scify and has many visual technical effects. But still there is a romantic story in the bare bones here to watch unravel, cheers!"
The Creator (2023),Avatar meets AI,"In a word, underwhelming. So much wasted potential in this movie. First, the good stuff. Casting and acting was spot on, for the most part. Visuals/SFX were amazing. After watching for just a few minutes, I was hooked - and I so very badly wanted this movie to be good. Unfortunately, the story is nonsensical and falls flat. The Chosen One searching for a McGuffin isn't an automatic deal breaker, but the execution in this film is poor. The action scenes have great visuals, but little suspension of belief. For example, at one point the bad guys shoot a barrage of missiles at the good guys' encampment. The missiles are highly effective, causing utter chaos and destruction. But after the first salvo of five missiles, the bad guys stop shooting and instead send droids walking into the encampment with countdown bombs attached. The audience is left scratching their heads at this questionable (and easily countered) strategy. There are other problems with the story and world building, and too many moments in the film where suspension of disbelief becomes difficult or impossible. These aren't so much ""plot holes"" as much as they are just incongruities. The pieces of the puzzle just don't fit together quite right."
The Creator (2023),"Visually stunning and an entertaining story, and some déjà vu","This movie looks great (Dune and Batman cinematographers) and I enjoyed the story. AI seemingly goes rogue and nukes humans, the humans fight back, and there's a secret weapon that can end the conflict and bring the lead's wife back. To me, this story felt like a mix of The Golden Child, Ex Machina (the ending), and Blade Runner. There were some holes that bugged me (knowing to turn the little statue, for example) and there were some cliche moments, but overall a fun movie. The characters (other than Alphie) aren't very memorable and I wasn't necessarily rooting for or against anyone. In the end, they are just machines being turned off."
Migration (I) (2023),Great movie!,"Migration is an animated film, it follows a family of ducks who migrate to Jamaica. Never having migrated before due to the fear of the unknown, they find themselves, in unexpected circumstances along the way meeting both friends and foe. Mack who is the main character not only finds his sense of adventure, but learns that living life is about taking risks especially when we are afraid. It is a very colorful piece that catches your eye in every scene! Migration is a great competitor against other animated works from studios like Dream works and Disney. Most memorable quote:
""You better open your eyes before you miss it all"" - Pam Mallard."
Migration (I) (2023),"Cliched, boring and constant antropomorphism","I didn't like this movie very much. Sure, it's beautifully animated, but the story is nothing new, nothing here is archetypal and deep, so the viewer really doesn't care what happens, unless the viewer is a small child. I might be a misantrope, but I'd much rather see a movie were animals behave like animals instead of having a duck family wanting to see the world with all the clichés that entails. Furthermore, that nasty chef is not really a good villain. He has no motivations whatsoever that we care about, and the good guys don't go slaying dragons or have cathartic experiences. Or maybe they do, but since the story is so childlike and full of clichés, we really don't care. My autistic friend loved it, and maybe smaller children will, too. For me I guess it's thumb down."
Migration (I) (2023),"Nice, fun family film","'Migration' is a really well-made family film. It's a simple premise about anthropomorphic ducks - the father duck, Mack (Nanjiani), wants to protect his children/chicks, Dax (Jennings) and Gwen (Gazal), and the mother duck, Pam (Banks), wants them to experience the world and gain some experience. They meet some other ducks migrating south for the winter - they're presumably in North-Eastern USA - so they decide to do the same, with quirky uncle Dan (DeVito) in tow. What follows is both a semi-familiar road-trip comedy, as well as a refreshing take on family, trying new things and helping others. There's a great support cast, as the duck family passes through New York City and meets Chump the pigeon (Awkwafina), Delroy the macaw (Key), as well as Erin the heron (Kane) and GooGoo (Mitchell) - either a goose or a white duck. There's a nice jail-break sequence for Delroy, which sets up the human antagonist, the Chef. For some reason the Chef also has a Chinook and hunts them down, leading to Dax and Gwen having to step-up. The animation is a nice mix of cartoonish and realistic, and it looks excellent, especially at the end. There's no overly-scary moments, some teachable themes, the voice cast is all good and there's consistent laughs throughout. There's also 'Mooned', the 9-min 'Despicable Me' tie-in at the start of the film, which kids seemed to love."
Migration (I) (2023),"It's a fair movie, but lacks in some areas","After watching a trailer or two a few times, I was kinda interested in this but now that I've seen it..I'm not saying it's bad but it's definitely missing a few things. For starters, exactly who are the parents and what made the dad so paranoid?? What is his backstory? And who is Uncle Dan? Whose brother is he? What's his backstory? What is the deal with the chef? Dude has enough money for his own private military chopper yet lives in a crummy apartment. Again, I'm not saying it's bad, but the movie did feel quite short, not enough actions, the ""adventures"" were so-so, some scenes were on the brink of ""wtf is going on now?"" This movie feels like it's got a few holes in it where it could've been a decent story. So I'd give it a C."
Migration (I) (2023),A Funny and Refreshing Take in a Sea of Misses,"Rarely do I find a movie that captivates my heart like ""Migration"" did. It's a safe yet heartwarmingly funny film, a refreshing gem amidst many misses in the industry. The plot was engaging, and the humor... I found myself bursting into laughter, a rarity these days. Kumail Nanjiani and Tresi Gazal's voice acting breathed life into the characters, infusing the film with a vibrant and comedic essence. Their performances offered a fresh and delightful perspective. However, despite the talent, Awkwafina's presence felt exhausting, not due to poor performance but sheer overexposure in the cinematic landscape. Overall, ""Migration"" is a delightful journey, offering a charming storyline and standout performances, making it a memorable watch amidst the sea of recent film disappointments."
Migration (I) (2023),Illuminations Best Despicable Me,"Illumination, the studio behind the Despicable Me and Sing franchises, is thriving financially, with its Super Mario Bros. Movie being the second-highest grossing film of 2023. However, true respect and acclaim still elude the Minion-spawning animation house. Migration, a film about a family of ducks, the Mallards, led by Kumail Nanjiani and Elizabeth Banks, aims to break the labels of cheap gags and stories that appeal to a broad audience. The creative control of Ernest and Celestine co-director Benjamin Renner promises a different approach to other Illumination movies. Migration's success can be attributed to its focus on relationships and warmth, which has been absent from much of Illumination's output since the first Despicable Me. The Mallard family's journey to Jamaica is a well-crafted film that builds connections between its ducklings, enhancing the plot. The family's motivations for leaving their pond and their desire for adventure are relatable, as is the family's patriarch, Mack, who prioritizes the safety of his children over everything else. When the family faces the challenge of survival in New York City, their perception of the world is challenged. Despite being set up as a stereotypical family with a stern dad, loving mom, and a brash teenage boy with a cute younger sister, the film ensures an emotional attachment to the ducklings, making it a satisfying and formulaic film. The animation quality in Migration represents an evolution of Illumination's past work. The film begins with a beautifully rendered bedtime story, blending hand-drawn and CG elements. The CG journey is characterized by realism, with cliffs tanned with autumn leaves and New York cityscapes painted with concrete coldness and bustling life. The water animation and cloud effects are particularly impressive. These changes do not change Illumination's identity, but rather create a better version of the typical film. However, this overfamiliarity overshadows much of Migration's cool new elements. Migration, a 3D animation by Mike White, is a delightful story developed with French animation director Benjamin Renner. Renner, known for his 2012 2D film Ernest and Celestine, has joined Illumination to lead his first studio and 3D animation effort, which is sure to delight fans of ducks. The Mallard family lives a dependable life in a pond, with dad Mack (Kumail Nanjiani) hesitant to leave his accustomed life. Wife Pam (Elizabeth Banks) encourages him to relax and take their children, Dax (Caspar Jennings) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal), on a trip to Jamaica. After a heart-to-heart with Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito), Mack realizes he has been missing life's essence and agrees to take the family on a life-changing adventure."
Migration (I) (2023),I'm shocked!,"I'm honestly shocked! Migration is a really wholesome, loveable movie! What looked like a painfully average Illumination movie turned out to be one of its best! We got a well-written family story from Mike White about getting out of one's comfort zone and accepting change with likeable characters, solid humour, and beautiful visuals. It even had some good tension and suspense! Migration isn't your usual fare from Illumination, in fact, it might very well be the antithesis to the claims people (including me) make about Illumination. There are no pop culture references. The humour is character, visual, or slapstick based (I actually laughed a lot) and the characters are really lovable. It's very sweet and the animation is stunning and extremely expressive. The visuals are really stellar - a massive step up for Illumination. It's easily their best animation. The musical score was fantastic too - John Powell did not have to go that hard with his score. The music is so fun and inventive. And the voice cast turned out to be really awesome! Migration is a wholesome, charming film for the whole family that is very funny and has a lot of heart. Went in expecting a dumb, pop culture romp and got a funny, sweet, entertaining, and gorgeously animated family adventure. Illumination created an underrated gem with this one!"
Migration (I) (2023),Cute but trite,"Been there, seen it. This felt a little bit like Finding Nemo meets Ice Age. Scared father doesn't want family to leave the confines of the known and safe. Finally they set off on a trek, totally unprepared for what's out there. They pick up some stragglers. They have a couple of adventures. They find themselves in peril then get out of it. Meanwhile there's little pearls of wisdom that's leaned by one and all. The bad guys are really bad. The good guys are really good. But no one gets seriouslt hurt, not even the bad guys. Eventually they reach their destination and everyone lives happily ever after. Until the next adventure. Cute jokes. Mostly for kids. Some kind for the adults. Nothing risqué or off color. The most entertaining part was the pre movie short (a Minons story) that also seemed like a remake (of a Roadrunner Wiley Coyote short). Hi hum."
Migration (I) (2023),Family Friend,"The typical laidback light hearted fun family film! I love it a lot! The characters get plenty of screen time, no one gets left out or not a chance to shine. The flight scenes are beautiful and the animation for the flying is pretty stunning as well you can really sense the weight when they fly If that makes any sense. The character designs are great. So many different locations they visit it's interesting to see how different they all look, the scenery is neat to look at. Also all sorts of bird species they meet along the way of many shapes and size if you're a fan of birds you'll definitely enjoy this film!"
Migration (I) (2023),Could have been almost good,The first seconds are good and feels creative with the 2D sequence and adult jokes. But then it starts becoming just another Illumination film with annoying characters while taking stuff from other films like Rio (which Chris Meledandri right hand Carlos Saldanha directed) the migrating plot promoted in advertising is almost non-existent as they are already in New York in just 2 seconds after they leave their home. The Jamaican accent stereotyped red parrot character is extremely annoying and only serves as device for the No-Rio third act sequence and the villain just randomly decides to kidnap birds in a helicopter after some ducks messed up with his kitchen.
Violent Night (2022),A Bit of a Boring Night,Not sure how this film managed to be so boring but it didn't really entertain. The premise is flimsy and the action is a bit dull. Just lots of gore and body parts being thrown around for dramatic effect. It's slightly funny in places but nothing to write home about. The acting is so so and the written characters are extremely cliche. The young actress in it looks a bit 13 and they're treating her like a toddler one minute and than an adult who can deal with visceral bloody scenes the next. There's not enough cohesion for me. I know what they were trying to do here but they missed the mark.
Violent Night (2022),Disappointing!,"So this film ranges from an average action flick to an awkward mess. The Santa sequences were the only redeeming part for me. David Harbor really captured the disgruntled Santa character well. When he is alone on screen or facing off against the antagonist, the film is quite fun. However, the film's other characters are just abysmal. I get that the film is going for a mean-spirited character type thing, but it just doesn't work. The rich family was just irritating, except for maybe two characters. I wasn't interested in seeing them be saved. Furthermore, the villains tried to go for an over-the-top type style, but a large majority of their dialogue is just cringeworthy. I feel like if they'd explored the conflict of overwhelming wealth versus impoverished burglars, it might have worked a bit better. I mean, making the villains selfish murderers just seemed like a way to shove in more violent acts. But that's just me, maybe. Overall, I would suggest maybe skipping this one unless you are super interested in the concept!"
Violent Night (2022),Loved this. Fun action packed christmas movie,"Violent Night completely surpassed our expectations, it was a really good time - highly enjoyable and lots of funny moments. David Harbour is great in the role and really brings it to life. The action looks good, it has fun and innovative fight scenes, and just enough blood to satisfy your desire for the bad guys to get their comeuppance. It's good for teens and above - I have a feeling younger kids may find the fights a bit too bloody - but could be a really good family Christmas movie. I'd happily watch it every Christmas and make a tradition out of it. If you like Die Hard you'll probably like this."
Violent Night (2022),"Ho, Ho, Holy sh--","'Violent Night (2022)' is surprisingly earnest in its themes of Christmas magic and rekindling your Christmas spirit. What initially seems like a sardonic anti-Christmas movie soon reveals itself to be genuinely interested in spreading Yuletide cheer, although that's not to imply it doesn't also feature all the brutality, bad language and bodily fluids its concept promises. Merging 'Die Hard (1988)', 'Home Alone (1990', 'Bad Santa (2004)' and 'John Wick (2014)' (or, perhaps more accurately, some of its lesser imitators), the piece provides a stockingful of festive fun despite its undeniably derivative nature. David Harbour and John Leguizamo make up for the cast's general lack of charisma, as they're eminently watchable and sell even the silliest of dialogue. Though the piece is certainly self-aware, it's also really sincere and it establishes a strong sense of character for its central figure. In fact, Papa Noël actually has a relatively convincing character arc which prevents his inclusion from feeling as half-baked as it may initially seem. Although the flick sometimes comes closer to feeling like 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009)' than 'Die Hard (1988)' (particularly when it comes to most elements not directly associated with Santa), it features plenty of well-choreographed and exciting set-pieces that revel in all the gory mayhem you could want. The action never rises to the level of something like 'John Wick (2014)', but it's better than a lot of similar American stuff and it continues the welcome post-'Wick' trend of having clean camera work that favours wider compositions. The movie is really fun when it gets going. It has a few issues here and there, and it's arguably a little too sappy for its own good, but it's an entertaining actioner with a strong central performance and several accomplished set-pieces."
Violent Night (2022),Die Hard Meets Home Alone Meets Friday The 13th!,"""Violent Night"" is a satirical, extremely violent dark comedy about the ""real"" Santa Claus looking to save a little girl and her family as they're being held hostage by a group of military trained criminals. David Harbour is simply perfect as the bad ass Santa gone all out wild on the criminals. Just imagine ""Die Hard"" meets ""Home Alone"" meets Jason from ""Friday The 13th"" movies, add tons of violent gory deaths with tongue firmly planted in cheek and you'll get an idea what this movie is all about. This is not masterpiece theater so if you're expecting something profound, please look elsewhere. ""Violent Night"" is good holiday gory fun and those of us who enjoy this type of humor (pitch black humor) will certainly enjoy it very much! 9 out of 10!"
Violent Night (2022),"HO HO HO Holy Mother, that was fun!","Isn't it fantastic when everything you love nicely comes together? Especially around Christmas! What I like to do most during the holiday period is watching at least one - preferably more - Christmas horror movies, but the two mainstream non-horror Christmas movies that I've seen the most (that everyone has seen the most, for that matter) are ""Die Hard"" and ""Home Alone"". ""Violent Night"" may not be a genuine horror movie, but it's excessively violent for sure, and - moreover - it's a love letter to the two aforementioned cinematic Christmas landmarks! Tommy Wirkola, who brought us the refreshing ""Dead Snow"", goes mainstream with this thrill-ride of an actioner about Santa Clause - the real one - battling a small army of evil scoundrels and protecting a cute girl and her rotten wealthy family during a heist/home invasion. It's not very original, it's not particularly sophisticated, but it sure is a lot of fun. Certain ideas and gimmicks in the script are genius, like Santa having a Viking background, the casting of Beverly D'Angelo as a loathsome hag of a matriarch, or the killing of thugs with Christmas attributes like candy canes or electric lights. Other parts are clichéd and/or sentimental (but mandatory), like the overlong ""true meaning of Christmas"" conversations, but that's just a minor default. The ""John Wick"" type of battle in the bar is déjà-vu but nonetheless exciting, especially because it's to the cheesy tones of Bryan Adams' ""Christmas Time"". There are other jolly great songs on the soundtrack, like from Slade and Burl Ives, and a great role for John Leguizamo as über-villain ""Scrooge""."
Violent Night (2022),Awesome santa. Better than expected. Unnecessarily gory,"Is definitely NOT for under 13. Have many weird comebacks, yet enjoyable, to Die Hard and Home Alone combined. David Harbour delivers an excellent rendition of a Santa really worthy yo be a Mortal Kombat One character; John Legizamo is excellent too
After a thousand gunshots the movie somehow still hold many plot holes (pun intended), but who cares when you are enjoying Finish Him combos. The only really bad part is trying to make an action movie and go with the trend of extra violent extra gory extra ketchup blood sprinkling all over the camera and limbs and heads rolling around. I will enjoy it one more time some other christmas in the future."
Violent Night (2022),"Good concept, terrible script and execution","It's always terrible when you see a concept that has potential, but then is destroyed by the script and by the directing. This film is precisely and instance of that. Home Alone has more actual violence than this. Sure, Violent Christmas has violence and gore, but it's not truly violent, because there is nothing at stake, it's empty of thrills and its so incredibly dumbed down and bland that only a very very specific public will find this good. The gore is not shocking at all, the psychological violence is null, and the characters have lines that are trying to pay tribute to Die Hard or Home Alone, but just sound like they were written by a 5 year old. There is good stupid and bad stupid and this is clearly in the bad camp. Good concept, absolutely terrible execution. Makes you wonder if the script is actually good, but then the studio came in and completely destroyed it. This film could easily be PG-13, it doesn't offend or shock anyone more than home alone does. Pathetic waste of money and a good idea."
Violent Night (2022),Die Hard when Home Alone with Santa Clause,"This movie turned out suprisingly entertaining. It was much better than I expected. I ignored this movie for a few weeks but when I saw reviews in IMDB, I decided to watch it. And I'm glad I did. Think of this as amalgamation of Die Hard, Home Alone & Santa Clause movies. It is a very different take on Santa. A Santa whose inner animal has been unleashed. And while it is gory in many areas, it never truly takes itself seriously. The movie has plenty of comedy thrown here and there. Some good, some terrible. But all-in-all, it was entertaining. So, if you don't take this movie seriously and accept it for what it is - ie. Pure mindless entertainment - then you won't be disappointed. SUMMARY: A different take on a Christmas movie and Santa Clause. It's entertainment not for kids."
Violent Night (2022),Mainly a GORE fest,"If you like Gore and action more than storylines I think you'll love this. The guy who played Santa was fantastic! He displays a depth of emotions. He truly cares about people. He's also a troubled soul, which makes him very relatable. He can also really kick his ass which is really fun. Lol This was entertaining enough that I didn't need to pick up my phone while watching it But there was quite a bit of character development with the hostages and we didnt get a Resolution of any kind with any of them when the movie ended. By the time the movie ended I really wanted to know what was going to happen with the relationships of the hostages, and we didn't get resolution with any of them. They all got to live, and Santa rode off on his sleigh, and the movie was over This was one of the most OVER THE TOP GORY violent movies I've ever seen next to that World War II tank movie with Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf. The home alone gimmicks added up to about not even five minutes of the movie The biggest theme of the movie are the diehard references, but it wasn't enough to make this movie a classic or a new favorite I love die hard, and I wish there was actually a lot more specific diehard references This movie went for Gore over a great storyline or great characters or great side characters It doesn't even hold a candle to die hard, which is one of my all-time favorites."
Silent Night (2023),A good story but a bad movie,"The actting is awful with so many nonsense moves. He modified that useless Mustang and added 4 exhaust?? Seriously? Why would anyone do that? First, it appeared with Two exhaust pipes but when he went to fight we saw it with four exhaust. In one fight scene he stabbed with a knife in the leg but he walked normally after that. And for not killing the lady with that evil laugh when he got the chance would anyone just tell me why? What's the point? Overall the movie got a great idea but the tried to do it John Wick way and they ruined the whole thing. They can make a second season with a better cast."
Silent Night (2023),Poor Man's Law Abiding Citizen,"This film was a poor man's Law Abiding Citizen (at best). The film jumps straight into the mute protagonist in some sort of chaotic scene. The next 25 minutes is the main character mourning a child we've never seen who was killed in the crossfire of an unknown gang war. Cheap and tacky feel during the first 1/3rd of the film with no character development or character bonding possible from the audience. Due to the lack of context around the characters themselves. 2/3rd of the film is the standard montage of the protagonist suddenly training to become a killing machine in his garage. Final 3rd is the inevitable killing spree. Very bizarrely they choose to make everyone else mute. Because the protagonist is mute, as some kind of suspense/bonding tactic by the creators. But it just makes no sense."
Silent Night (2023),Boring. No white doves,"Really boring. Had to fast forward so many times... The main character is hollow despite a much too long introduction. He has no consideration for his wife and is a living cliché, so to speak. It reminded me the Charles Bronson Death Wish movies. It's as bad, just visually better. John Woo needed money but wasn't interested, obviously. Joel Kinnaman has been better. And the story requires more than a suspension of belief. Steven Seagal movies could feel realistic compared to this one. It's a mockery of an action movie, without any humor or irony. Just very bad. Such a disappointment... Not recommended."
Silent Night (2023),"Well it's no Die Hard. Or Face Off, come to think of it...","The question: Can John Woo sustain interest in an Christmas-set action movie conducted almost completely in silence? The answer: Not really, no. But he certainly gives it a bloody good go, and after the tedious first half when our grieving father (who has his voicebox blown out early, hence the title) trains himself to be a superman to avenge his dead son, there is a number of impressive fight scenes during the intense climax involving cars, guns, martial arts, knives... the works. To get there though, you'll have to wade through a whole load of soapy melodrama involving the deceased kid and the protagonist's non-existent chemistry with his wife. What makes it even more tough is the aforementioned absence of proper dialogue from the movie, so it's very hard to relate to this couple who can't even properly communicate their feelings to each other. Oh well. I can't help thinking the film would've been better if they'd ditched the stupid 'silence' gimmick and just done a straight action flick. Plus a bit more humour would've be nice... apart from the bizarre opening sequence involving hero wearing a Rudolf jumper whilst chasing the bad guys, there's not much funny here at all. 5/10 mostly for the last half-an-hour or so... once you get there, decide for yourself if it was worth it or not."
Silent Night (2023),Probably best Kinnamon doesn't speak,"I'm sure there is a great actor in there somewhere just waiting to come out, but we have yet to see it I fear, and I so want him to be good. Unfortunately this isn't the time it happens. Whilst you maybe expecting a Robocop 2 style film to follow on from the first remake, you will be disappointed. Largely unrealistic, a run of the day sparky turns himself into John wick overnight. Ok a Temu version of John Wick! Expect lots of action scenes, but then get disappointed when they last a few seconds and your back to the main chara ter going through a Rocky 4 style training programme in his garage to emerge, well, not rocky. Just slightly better than your next door neighbour learning a bit of judo twice a week at the local YMCA. Could have cut out half the film which concentrated on the main character teaching himself how to fight and drive from you tube....we get it! Move on. Although you could have just skipped it all and muddled your way through killing all the bad guys without the training, trust me it didn't make much difference. Definitely a try hard movie, not altogether terrible just slow uninspiring. I'd rather have it been robocop 2 with kinnamon again as at least it's a take on a classic."
Silent Night (2023),No Dialogue? Challenge Accepted Says John Woo!,"I had intended to watch this movie in theaters, but there were too many other movies I chose to pay for in theaters and missed out. It may have been good I did. I finally saw this on a streaming service and I was blown away. First, I usually run my sound system at level 20. I thought my ears were messed up and turned it to 25 and still heard very little. I had no idea this movie has nearly no dialogue. While movies have been able to pull this off for effect and purpose, I don't see why no other character in the movie could say anything. Lots of texting and sign language. I guess John Woo was challenged to direct a movie with no actual dialogue. Second, this movie, while cliche to the max, could have been way more entertaining. Everyone loves a revenge / payback movie. However, this was a complete mess. The storytelling was all over the place, and without anyone actually talking, you, the viewer are left trying to learn how to read body language and texts. Third, this is a huge drop off for both Kinnaman who I loved in Altered Carbon Season 1 - IMO, the best single season in Sci-Fi TV history, and John Woo who directed Face / Off. Lastly, the ending of this movie was more of a comedy than anything. I really don't know if John Woo was trolling the studio for the ending or what. The action scenes were ok, but the rest of the movie was a complete mess. The only positive is it's only around 100 minutes so you can watch in one sitting."
Silent Night (2023),Not sure there are any redeeming points to this film.,"I generally like Joel kinnermans films, good solid actor and funny too. I think I thought this was going to be a Death Wish type movie, and have no issues with revenge vigilante films. This was definitely not what I thought. Violent, tick, story, well there is story, so tick. But ultimately this is a grim, grim film of a man in pure raw grief. Could never have a happy ending. In many ways it reminded me of 3 Billboards..... A great film, but half way through you realise that Frances mcCormand would get her revenge but never get her daughter back. We made it to the end, but it's 1 hour 44 minutes of my life that I can never get back. Nothing wrong with the activity, but a grim movie that I (and husband) disliked intensely. You have been warned."
Silent Night (2023),Poor excuse for writer's block,"If you can't think of anything to write perhaps don't attempt a feature length movie. This is just another gimmick in the last few years that has been tried as everyone is struggling to come up with new ideas. Maybe black and white films will make a come back next year. I like Joel, but here he is about as hamstrung as an actor can be agreeing to be in a film without dialogue. There has to be some sort of savant film maker to be able to pull this off, and Woo is more of an action director, and it just doesn't work. Sadly, even if you add in a script and additional veteran actors this is still a mess as the story is just simple. Hard Pass."
Silent Night (2023),A Swing and A Miss,"The relationship and love of the father and son are beautifully depicted in this awful film. Unfortunately, that's ALL that's good, wholesome, right, meaningful or even believable in this bloody, violent, waste of film. Totally EVERYTHING else is complete crap. According to.the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, the primary meaning of the word ""gratuitous"" is:
""1 : not called for by the circumstances : not necessary, appropriate, or justified : UNWARRANTED"" The ridiculous car scenes, gunfight scenes and gang-war scenes in this 104 minute dreck lend a whole new meaning to the phrase ""gratuitous violence"". More like TOTALLY not called for, COMPLETELY not necessary, VERY inappropriate and ABSOLUTELY unjustified. Blood, gore and violence merely for the sake of blood, gore and violence and not the least bit entertaining.. It's a darn shame because the main theme of the movie (a father's revenge against his sons killers) coulda, woulda and shoulda made a great film. Unfortunately, in THIS incidence, it didn't."
Silent Night (2023),Not your Mommas Woo.....,"A tormented father witnesses his young son die when caught in a gang's crossfire on Christmas Eve. While recovering from a wound that costs him his voice, he makes vengeance his life's mission and embarks on a punishing training regimen in order to avenge his son's death...... 20 years later, and Woo finally comes back to Hollywood, and the first thing I thought after watching this was.......why bother? When he first arrived in Hollywood for his first ten year stint, he made two excellent films, and three decidedly average. You can guess what the two great films were, as the others were Paycheck, Windtalkers, and Broken Arrow. But even those three look like The Killer compared to this rubbish. Kinnamen watches his son die, gets shot in the throat, and works out for a year. That's eighty percent of the film. And bless him, I know he's lost his son and everything, but there's no need to be such an unlikeable person, it makes the audience not really care for you. With Woo, it's a given that you expect some really good action choreography with his set pieces, and this had all the potential to be something special, but the alarm bells were ringing when the trailers stated 'from the producers of John Wick'. With a director with the calibre of Woo, it didn't need that added sell, action aficionados know who Woo is, and what he's capable of, so I know i'm not the only one who will be disappointed. There was one instance toward the end, which lasted for about four seconds, when I felt that Woo magic, but then a week later, I saw Hard target and The Killer again, and it reminded me of what a master he once was. This most definitely isn't it. What an ironic title."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Thank You Tom Cruise!!!,"Dear Tom Cruise, Thank you so much! Your performances are always a guarantee for top-quality and exceptional movies. I truly believe you are the best in the industry! The film ""Maverick"" was nothing short of FANTASTIC! :) You are, without a doubt, the greatest, and I sincerely hope you continue to create more movies like this. I greatly miss them! Also, a huge thanks to everyone involved in the movie, even in the smallest roles. Your collective efforts have created something truly GREAT. I mean it from the bottom of my heart
-. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!! Warm regards, Aron."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Awesome,"So good loved it. Love the plot and everything. It was the perfect amount of action, and you really just could connect with each character. A great movie for action lovers. This movie really puts you in the edge of your seat. It was done so well. 10/10 One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. So if you are looking for a cool movie to watch with your action loving family I would 100% recommend this movie. It is just pure action no gore and other stuff. Just a great action movie. But there is also just enough not action where you get to know the characters and get to feel like your in the movie."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Nailed it!,"It is rare for a sequel / reboot to be this good, but they absolutely nailed it! The plot was interesting and believable, the acting was awesome, the soundtrack was incredible and the action scenes were just spectacular! I particularly liked how they handled the scene with Iceman in terms of Val Kilmer not being able to talk due to real-life medical issues. Considering Kilmer said very few words, it was a very emotional and poignant scene indeed. There are quite a lot of callbacks to the original Top Gun movie, so it's beneficial to have watched that before watching this one - you will get the most out of it if you do. But for youngsters who haven't seen the original, this is still a fantastic movie in its own right. They really did a fantastic job with this movie. Watch it!"
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),A distant sequel that respects and surpasses the legacy of the original,"Given that the original film is such an iconic piece of american cinema released in the height of the 80s and the launch platform of superstar Tom Cruise, making a sequel seemed a daunting task and at times an unnecesary one, but this film proves otherwise as the final product is a masterfully crafted movie that respects the original film and is able to surparsse it in every aspect: production,acting, dialogue,etc. In order to fully appreciate this movie, a theather is neccesary as it is the only tool that conveys adrenaline Rush of an aerial dogfight. A passion project in Tony scott's memory."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Borders on good but far from a classic,I could not brow an emotional attachment with the characters in this film as I did with the first one. Tom Cruise carries the movie most of the way through but you could near say with a bunch of cliche scenes that were a throw back from the first movie. I could say that the movie felt slapped together more for a cash grab rather than put together a great follow up script from part 1. It was the usual script where they throw the manual out the window and let's do it the way that would get 99% thrown out of a training school whether it be a teacher or student but it's ok for Maverick to work right outside the laws that everyone else is given and get away with it with no action taken. I liked two scenes in it and one was when Tom was initially in the bar and saw his ex wingman's son playing the piano and the scene where he met up with Val Kilmer. The rest was predictable and nothing new added to the story from part 1. It was good but I really felt it was more of a let's run the 2nd movie to grab some extra cash rather than bringing anything new to make it more intriguing. Good and I sat through it but wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Visually stunning action movie,"Yes offcourse there are clichés. Yes offcourse this is a commericial profit endeaovour. Yes the plotline isn't much. Yes, al lot of unnecessary sentiment and drama. But come on. Appreciatie it for what it is. It is a great, visually stunning action movie. It is hard to say wether it is accurate towards the navy and aviation in generaal. Most people do not know and do propably not care. Respect for tom cruise for being in such fine condition in his sixties. Even if you have no clue of topgun part one, this is still a very enjoyable Watch. Go Watch it on a big screen if possible, it adds up to tegen effect."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Boom bang crash,"This is a typical American overproduction. It proves that if you throw enough cash at it, you can make any film spectacular. And truly, the special effects are stunning, time and again. Other than that: this movie contains just too much nonsense. Too much coincidence, over-the-top displays of heroism and plots that keep on repeating themselves
Yet, it's difficult to get bored, watching this movie. Of course, they throw in the mandatory romance although it has nothing to do with the facts at hand. Being totally honest, you'll have to admit that you wouldn't have lost anything worthwhile if you missed this movie. It's just another costly time-waster."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Needed less cliches and to be much shorter,"While the nods to the original were lovely and all, there were WAY too many and it bordered on ridiculous in some parts. Added to which, the film was unnecessarily long - primarily in scenes that were paying ""homage"" to the first. That said, the film had merit and the final part of the movie is super cool and definitely worth the wait. Seeing Val Kilmer, despite his limitations die to his cancer, was magnificent. Could have done without the Ice Man lookalike though. That said... the actor selected to play Gooses son was fantastic! He looked so similar and had the same swagger. No wonder Anthony Edwards was happy with the choice!"
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),A fine sequel.,"A terrific thrilling film which works its socks off to entertain you. Technically its spectacular the sound design conveying the awesome speed and power of aviation, the cinematography and cockpit footage is second to none and leaves you baffled how they achieved it. The new group of characters are memorable and the film does a good job at developing them and their stories while also allowing Tom Cruise to still shine in the lead role. The film has some nice call backs to the original but it's more just a just a repeat of the first movie. The film is pretty fresh these days in being very unapologetic and patriotic in it's themes and imagery. While it's a pretty great film there's a few moments where it tries a bit too hard to pay homage to the original, it also had me think it pushed things a bit too far towards the end that I didn't quite believe it. Overall though a fine entertaining movie with some amazing aviation scenes and Tom Cruise giving one of his best performances."
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),Totally Predictable and out of time,"I really don't understand all the fuss around this sequel. It's completely predictable, in every scene, by anyone (even by a child). I grow up but Tom Cruise hasn't and he's ridiculous acting like this. That's Peter Pan syndrome, man! The movie is also unnecessarily long. I do acknowledge that I enjoyed the first Top Gun more ALSO because I was younger and less ""demanding"", but at least that movie was brand new and in line with those years. This one is not, it's out of time, no matter the efforts to update it If that's the best Hollywood can offer nowadays, then it's a well deserved epitaph. Maybe directors (and actors) shouldn't go on strike against AI, but rather prove themselves still capable of something either good and new. So definitely not Too Gun Maverick!"
Napoleon (2023),not worth watching,"Napoleon somehow manages to be too long while at the same time missing important details, perhaps this story would have been better adapted into a TV show like HBO's Rome? I went into this film expecting at least some level of historical accuracy, but obviously the 100 days and especially the battle of Waterloo have their significance blown way out of proportion. Not actually tying much together in the form of history, the movie is instead a montage of some famous battles and Napoleon's marriage troubles. However, the lack of politics (aside from the absolutely disdainful portrayal of Robespierre) and shoddy history can be chocked up to my own preferences. Aside from that, the film is not very interesting in its own right. Most biopics can make up for their blandness by at least being historically accurate or interesting, but Napoleon is a snoozer full of Hollywood tropes. Even Phoenix, who is a great actor, just can't shine in this role. At least some parts of the movie made me laugh, but overall it's not bad enough to be considered a comedy, especially with its excessive runtime. Just bland, and not worth watching."
Napoleon (2023),"Good but should have been great, epic truthfully","I went through the reviews and almost skipped the flick, glad I didn't but I agree with many of the complaints. I'm a big fan of Scott & Phoenix, but yeah, the kind magic that happened in good ole' Gladiator didn't happen here sad to say. Many of the negatives pointed out are legit, some are more of nitpicks really and thus exaggerations and then there are bent history buffs complaining. Here are the 3 biggest negatives as I see them with some commentary about them: 1. Lack of emotion, passion & tension - This is probably the biggest flaw as it really ratchets down enjoyment, even in battles which is crazy. These should have been glorious tense exciting feats or defeats; instead all we got were great visuals and well-choreographed battles. Even just a celebration after would have helped, nope, hard to care the way they were portrayed, not even a single outburst in the entire flick. To drive this home a little more, here we have one of the greatest & most famous battle commanders of all time and what we see from him is essentially an arm signal during battles? Epic fail right there. Outside of battles unfortunately it shows and stings even more, even in his marriage which makes up about half the film. In the films 1st 20 mins Phoenix is completely catatonic which I put on him. He then relaxes somewhat in the role but unfortunately this demeanor is still there throughout the entire film, which I put more on Scarpa & Scott. We finally do see a little emotion from Nappy when he is confronting Josephine about one of her misdoings but even there he's largely flat. I mostly blame the screenplay for all this but truth is Scott & Phoenix share some blame here too. Even the score is at fault, it could have easily added some tension to many scenes and instead it completely fails to do so. 2. Nappy's missing character - Many have gone on about the historical inaccuracies of which there are but to me the bigger flaw is the incomplete portrayal of one of World's greatest Military Masterminds. There really were no big historical departures, the film followed along his timeline close enough, yes things were embellished in places its fairly rare movies don't do this for the big screen to some degree. So what we do see is a very uncharismatic military officer who somehow manages to rise through the ranks, gain the admiration of many and eventually become Emperor? That doesn't jive really. Those who have read up know he had insecurities and even social awkwardness, but come on. He was not one-dimensional like we seen by any stretch and what was left out were his more interesting qualities; like the highly intelligent passionate hard working persuasive confident leader with an undying ambitious determination who could easily inspire thousands to follow him. Read some of the first-hand reports about him, it's absolutely criminal that we didn't see any of this side of him, and the movie would have been SO MUCH BETTER if we had, and that goes right back into point 1 I made as well. Many are blaming Phoenix here and while I'm not letting him totally off the hook this ultimately falls on Scott no matter how the script was written and how it was acted. It's his film and ultimately his decision on how we would see Nappy portrayed. 3. Too much Josephine not enough battle - This comes down to preference somewhat but the majority of people if polled would agree here I'm sure, even though Kirby does a great job in her role and is one of the highlights. At least we could have had more scenes leading up to battles, showing us why the conflicts arose, but a little more battle time would have been nice. Then we could have hopefully witnessed some of his brilliance and why he has been so thoroughly studied by so many, and just look at how the Egypt battle was shown it was pitifully short, terrible. We could of even had a little more Politics, it's hard to overlook the glaring omission of the fundamental liberal policies he implemented in France & throughout Western Europe, and his lasting legal achievement the Napoleonic Code which was adopted in various forms by many of the World's legal systems. No, instead somewhere around 50% of the movie is just focused on his marriage and ultimately it really drags down the pacing, and the movie. ----- I've painted a pretty negative impression of the movie but as I said above I still found it enjoyable, it helped that I lowered my expectations beforehand thanks to some of the reviews here. Its shame Scarpa & Scott took the directions they did it feels like a lost opportunity for a Grand Epic, and in the end I think competently covering his whole political & military career in 1 flick is a bridge too far, which didn't help either."
Napoleon (2023),A character named Napoleon but not Napoleon,"The title says it all. You can do a dramatization of an historical figure if you'd like. But to completely remove all attributes about that figure while leaving the bare essentials to say ""well, it's human"" is just lazy. I read an interview with Ridley before the movie and knew things were bad. He apparently read one book ""before getting tired and having his researcher look into things"". Which is fine, but don't expect people to not call you on being over the hill and burned out when you take an epic written by another great film maker, bad mouth it, then strip it down anyway and use the structure and pop this out. Napoleon and Kubrick must be rolling in their grave. Also Ridley is a knighted Englishman so how he would not have a biased and negative view of this figure is something I've wondered as well. Clearly he hated Napoleon otherwise we wouldn't be sunbhexted to some of these utterly useless and boring scenes of Napoleon basically just breathing (he's usually fumbling or being awkward because Ridley seems to have a pathology to depict him this way). Also in the interview I read in the NYT, Phoenix came to him about 10 days before shooting and admitted he could not play this character as written. And is shows. Because the character is not real. It's a fantasy dreamed up by someone that doesn't like Napoleon. He's a tyrant but incompetent. He's a brilliant tactician and general but does insane things in battle that make no sense. He has massive amount of support and love from the people and troops yet he has no charisma and is almost autistic. No wonder Phoenix could not figure the character out, he never could have. It's a bad movie that seems entirely derivative of the current times in which we live in which we are not supposed to believe in a single individual being capable of changing the course of history. Good or bad, this does happen. And you can't just stand there and breath, you have to act and be the person the time calls for. Napoleon did that. Ridley doesn't want to acknowledge it."
Napoleon (2023),Napoleon - A total disaster in film,"I waited over 40 years for this film, and saw it on full IMAX but what a massive disappointment in almost every respect it was, apart from some good military and social costumes and the cinematography. Ridley Scott has clearly lost the plot, like this film which is so historically inaccurate as to be criminal. No wonder the French hated it as it's a very poor documentary of Napoleon's colourful life. Entire tracts of major historical events are ignored or have been very badly edited out to get this pile of trash down to 2.5 hours and several scenes never even happened. Save your money and watch the epic 'Waterloo' from 1971 instead. It's filmed with (pre-CGI) cast of tens of thousands, with brilliant, accurate battles and the actors are superb, especially Rod Steiger as Napoleon and Christopher Plummer as Wellington. Makes me sad that the brilliant director Stanley Kubrick (a lifelong Napoleonic nut like me) died before he could finally make this film, as he so badly wanted to do. 'Waterloo' is the best film on this subject and still looks great today!"
Napoleon (2023),Embarrassing,"Honestly, absolutely embarrassing depiction of Napolean. They depicted him as borderline simple. The movie is so focused on his relationship with Josephine that it totally disregards his military career, generals and the battle scenes have absolutely no cognisance to the story. Waterloo was such a random scene that it should never have been included!! Shockingly bad movie. Only gave it a 3 incase IMDB disregards reviews that are 1&2. Napolean was an absolute monster in the theater of war and extremely dangerous on the battlefield. He changed the course of history but this movie makes out he needs care. I have no idea why Ridley decided to depict him in this way. DONT waste your money as you will be very dissapointed."
Napoleon (2023),Excellent trailer - not so the movie,"I will not get in to the historical inaccuracies, as in a lot of historical movies history is adapted for dramatic purposes. It is Hollywood after all and especially for big budget movies the goal is to make a lot of money. Beautiful Trailer. My main criticism is the portrayal of Napoleon. Of course all who knew him are long gone and many accounts are subjective, so we have to make do with that information. But I can not imagine that a man who ends up on top after all the chaos of the French Revolution, whose generals and soldiers stay loyal to him after all the battles and blood, wasn't an enormous charismatic man. And that's where the film completely fails for me. You can hate him, admire him, love him, belittle him as Wellington, but the film makes him, and his relationship with Josephine, uninteresting and dull, and as the title is Napoleon, that was my feeling leaving the cinema. A bit more effort of Mr Scott and Mr. Phoenix to know the character and history would probably have added value."
Napoleon (2023),not historically accurate enough,"The movie was fine but sadly there was just to many jumpcuts that did not make sence or really destroyed the immersion of the movie. The movie was also focused too much on his wife and how she acted around him. She got too much attention in the movie whilst not adding anything to the movie, since the movie is about napoleon, not his wife. Napoleons character also changed constantly. Along with the many historical inaccuracies such as shooting the pyramids, the battle of waterloo where we did nt even see him get shot in the shoulder, or how he opend a mummy's tomb. Or the beheading at the start of the movie, it was really dissapointing to see him do things that he never did."
Napoleon (2023),A beautiful and interesting historical movie,"At the beginning, they show France after the Revolution, what it was like. They show Napoleon, his character and manner. It is interesting to watch him, his life. They reveal a romantic line. It was also interesting to see the change in relations between France and other countries. The fights in this movie are action, they are beautifully depicted. It is also interesting to watch the war between Napoleon and the Russian Empire. But Joaquin Phoenix, in my opinion, is too old to play the role of young Napoleon, although he played it well. In general, the movie is not bad, suitable for those interested in European history."
Napoleon (2023),Manage Your Expectations,"This film is getting most of its hate because it is slow paced, very long, and doesnt live up to the hype the trailer sets up for it. The most epic scenes in the film are shown in the trailer. There are a lot of reason to not love this movie. I especially have many reasons to hate this movie, i had to write a seven page paper on it. But after all the bad is said and done, this movie still stands REALLY strong as a Napolean biopic. It is so well done. It looks great. I care a lot about looks. And this film looks great. Some of the battle scenes alone merit this film being awesome, even though they make up only a fifth of the film. There is a lot great here. Great performances. Great cinematography. Great dialogue writing. It feels incredibly real to its period. The pace is slow, but i still found it very entertaining. MY expectations were low. Thats maybe why i found it more enjoyable then others."
Napoleon (2023),A big budget film without a penny to stand on.,"I actually fell asleep somewhere in the middle of the film. I couldn't get a grip on the story. It felt all over the place. Also, I had an issue with English accents on supposedly French characters. The only believable character I felt that fit in was the Austrian Ambassador portrayed by Tom Godwin. Other than that, costumes were nice, set and décor was nice as well. There are so many stories and angles that could have been covered in this film. So many opportunities to delve into the history of Napoleon. So many wonderful actors with no foundation to build from. All missed. What did I just see? A big budget film without a penny to stand on."
Gran Turismo (2023),Spit in the face to the racing community.,"As a motorsport film it fails terribly. Studios that make movies about racing it should prioritize racing fans and put work into making the scenes make sense. RACING fans should not have to ignore the blatant inaccuracies in the RACING scenes of a RACING movie in order to enjoy it. The physics of the cgi cars (which are used a lot) make no sense. They handle nothing like real cars, the crashes are all over the place, the main character can press the throttle harder than the other drivers and drive nonsensical racing lines but still gain time. There are countless other examples of motorsport inaccuracies in this movie's action and dialogue. This kind of unrealistic representation of racing for dramatic effect works in dumb explosion movies like Fast and Furious and kid's movies like Cars, but I feel that it is immensely distracting from this movie that is supposed to tell an amazing story that actually happened. The producers of the movie either didnt consult people that drive and have experience with LMP and GT cars or just ignored their input and rushed the movie. Some people said that the CGI scenes are supposed to be a combination between the Gran Turismo game and real life. This is not a good excuse for the unrealistic cars and phisics since the movie portrays GT as the most realistic driving simulator ever. The CGI racing scenes would have even been more realistic if they would have been filmed in the actual Gran Turismo game. Movies can both tell a great story and have realistic racing action that does not deter from it (e.g. Ford v Ferrari, Rush, The World's Fastest Indian). If you are not a racing fan/driver and you can look past the very bad dialogue and the, at times, bad cinematography than this film can be enjoyable for you. However if you become passionate about racing after seeing this film or if you were already a motorsport enthusiast you should be able to see the huge flaws and inaccuracies within this movie."
Gran Turismo (2023),A very good racing movie,"As a fan of racing I have certain standards for racing in movies. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be okay at best, but this movie was a pleasant surprise The story was quite fun to follow, if a little predictable at times. The characters weren't very deep, but decent enough. There was no character that made me want to rub my head into the couch anytime they spoke. The fact it was a glorified advertisement shown through a few times like all the times they say, ""It's not a game. It's a simulator."" That got on my nerves quite a bit. Besides that the racing was pretty decent. Some of the passes were way too easy, but it was nowhere near as bad as some than movies. It isn't Lightning McQueen cutting through 40 cars in a few laps then being stuck at the front for the rest of the race. I thought cars and races looked pretty cool and the failure montage was fun. In summary, It is a pretty good movie and would suggest watching it."
Gran Turismo (2023),What did I watch?,"It's flashy, it's stylish, and it's full of cliché, cringe inducing dialog and writing, and completely fabricated nonsense. The writers have never watched a race or even bothered researching the topic before throwing this thing together. And their character tropes and archs were exhausted decades ago on children's cartoons. I think the ""bad guy"" (why does there have to be a bad guy in a racing movie?) literally belongs on a Captain Planet episode. The acting is subpar at best. Stranger Things guy was alright, as was Jann's actor, but Orlando Bloom was just...weird in this, and the actors for the ""bad guy"" (he's bad because...he's bad, ok?) and all the other drivers were just atrocious. And the best part. If you have any knowledge of motorsport or the laws of physics you may consider this a really bad comedy. Suddenly this guy who's never driven a car knows a better line than people who do this for a living AND spend time on simulators? Oh and his line is the outside of a dry track. Ugh I could go on, but I'm tired. So here's 4 stars for making a pretty movie."
Gran Turismo (2023),"""Borrowed car?""","I am a fan of the game and wanted to enjoy the movie more than I actually did. It is based on a true story and real people. I did not check to see how accurate it is, if at all. I am questioning the accuracy because the majority of the story line follows ""Days of Thunder"" very closely. Driver enters a type of racing where he is considered an outsider; mentor takes him under his wing; Other teams don't like him; has a major wreck; has to overcome fear to race again; races but falls behind but then has moment of clarity and hits the pedal; etc. As an American who likes Euro racing (F1) and tracks better than American (NASCAR, INDY), and played the game a lot, I did like the cars and tracks that they featured. The cars and tracks, combined with decent enough acting and directing make the movie ok. I was entertained for a couple hours, but never surprised and did not learn anything new about racing (or anything else for that matter...)."
Gran Turismo (2023),Forgettable,"It's one of those movies, that you can't hate, but you can't like, too. There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie. It looks good, the story overall is ok, too. But it feels kind of... Empty? Pointless? I did not feel much of a challenge in Jann reaching his dream, even though, I'm pretty sure, it was not that easy. Since there is no challenge, and since we already know how things will end (thanks to marketing) - there is absolutely no tension, there are no real stakes, there is no... Excitement. Which is core of racing, is it not? I remember people complaining that anime ""Overtake!"" lacked excitement in its racing, which was a valid criticism, but, at the least, it had something besides that: character development. It was not perfect, but it was there. Gran Turismo lacks even that. Or at least, I have not noticed any development. Besides, maybe, Jack Salter starting to believe that gamer can become a racer, after all. The original story is something that can inspire. That's what all the marketing was talking about: ""achieve your dream"". But achieving a dream is not easy. There are struggles involved there. Yes, they probably will not be as intense as being in literal war, but they will be there. A movie - is a great opportunity to dramatize those struggles, to make you feel the tension of going against the flow. This movie fails at that. Unless you think integrating elements from a game user interface equates to dramatization. I will forget this movie by tomorrow."
Gran Turismo (2023),Bored vs. Ferrari,"Gran Turismo is the greatest formula racing movie ever made. Wait, scratch that. What I meant to write was Gran Turismo is the most formulaic racing movie ever made. It is the product of a paint by numbers approach to making a sports movie; an underdog story, filled with self-doubt, overwhelming odds, montages, and every cliche you've ever seen. But there is a twist to Gran Turismo, something that I wasn't expecting at all, something that actually made the movie even more terrible. But more on that later... The movie is about a young gamer (""sim racer"") who is exceptional at the video game (""race simulator"") Gran Turismo, and wants one day to be a real life race car driver. He soon gets his chance when Nissan sponsors a Gran Turismo tournament, the winners of which will be trained to compete in reality based racing, you know, with actual cars. So, you guessed it, he wins the video game tournament and goes on to win Le Mans, the greatest achievement a professional racer can achieve. That's the plot, minus a few hackneyed details. Gran Turismo is essentially nerd porn. It shows the journey from gaming in mom's basement to real life fortune and glory; from dominating in a virtual reality to dominating in the real world; from watching internet porn to interacting with human females. It feels so fantastical and lazily contrived that I was shocked when the movie took an unexpected turn. If you're not one of the forty two people who follows professional racing, you'll be as shocked as I was to find out that this terrible movie is, in fact, based on a true story. Gran Turismo feels so fake and seems so stupid that I was shocked to find out that it has any basis in reality. This makes the movie worse, because, in real life, the story it tells is actually interesting. So, when the movie turns out this bad, it means filmmakers didn't just execute their own idea poorly, but instead they took an interesting and real story and made it suck. Now, why does the movie suck, you ask? To save myself (and the two or three people who will ever read this) some time, I will give a bulleted list of my grievances with Gran Turismo: -Lots of cliches: ""Can I do it,"" the hero asks himself. ""Can he do it,"" those around the hero ask each other. ""He can do it,"" the mentor tells the nay sayers. ""Your dreams are a fantasy,"" the dad tells his son. ""No they're not,"" the son tells his dad. Almost every second of Gran Turismo is something you have seen before in a better movie. -Absurd levels of product placement: It is easy to figure out who paid for GranTurismo, because there isn't one minute in the entire movie without the Nissan or Sony logo in it. And there also endless discussion about how Gran Turismo ""is more than a game."" -Montages: Once the movie gets going, it is non-stop montages with licensed music. There's at least seventy two mintages in the movie. -Unexciting driving scenes: I understand that watching a whole race would be boring, that's why no one does it. But the race scenes are also, you guessed it, just montages. Gran Turismo does not translate the excitement of driving at hundreds of miles per hour onto the big screen. The racing scenes are cut together with shots that are on average a half a second long. There is no excitement and no tension builds, despite the incredible efforts to manufacture some. There is also a terrible shot in Gran Turismo when the main character is about to execute a crucial maneuver on the track. The shot shows a profile view of the car racing forward, then the car becomes digitized and starts to fade away leaving only the main character. Then the background fades and we see him playing the Gran Turismo game in his room. It's as though the filmmakers are saying, ""no need to feel any excitement; all of this is a digital and fake. Just thought we'd let you know."" Why call so much attention to the fact that 99% of the driving in the movie is filmed in front of a green screen? It's a really dumb use of digital effects-actually, it's pretty much the opposite of what they were made for. -Dishonesty: At the end of Gran Turismo, the main character wins Le Mans. I did some research: he came in third. This leads me to wonder what else did the filmmakers take liberties with? I didn't care enough to look it up. If you want to watch a great racing movie based on a real story, watch Ford v Ferrari. If you just want to watch a racing movie that's better than this, it's a safe bet that any of them will do."
Gran Turismo (2023),Rockstar cast and rockstar movie,"This was an incredible story about a young man and his willingness to strive in the race car industry. It goes to show that people who play video games or anyone with a hidden talent needs to have the ability to shine. A loving, heart racing, action packed race car movie. Tragedy can come for anyone, but it's what you do with it that matters. I would have never thought I would have loved a race car movie so much. I never grew up watching or playing with race cars. But a good movie Deserves its recognition. Orlando bloom,David harbour and Archie are absolute rockstars. Passion needs to be recognized inside and outside the home as well."
Gran Turismo (2023),Surprisingly boring.,"If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It's cut like a video game, super choppy and fast. Filmed like a bunch of commercials cut together. The first half is definitely one of the worst first halves of a movie I've ever seen. Cardboard characters. The actors are all phoning it in. So boring and predictable. Everyone seems super tired and weary to be in the movie. The plot is paint-by-numbers. Surprising, because I love all of the director's other movies. However, the 2nd half does get better. Better editing, more emotion and better character development. All that said, I'm 48 so if you're younger it's possible you have the short attention span most of the movie is tailored for. My kids ages 8 and 10 loved it."
Gran Turismo (2023),Bad movie!,"I love SIM Racing and I am bog fan of motor tacing, but this movie is so bad, it is unbelievable! Bad acting, totally unrealistic racing! Don't spent your time watching it! Go and watch Le Mans with Steve McQueen or Grand Prix with Jame Garner. This movie is just a marketing tool for Gran Turismo and Nissan. Gran Turismo is a great video game, though. It is a shame, because the movie is a based on a true story, but it appears to me to be made only for one purpose: to make money. I really can not unterstand why Orlando Bloom and David Harbour agreed to be in this movie. I hope they earned at least a lot of money because this should be quoted as worst movie of their careers."
Gran Turismo (2023),WOW,"Who would have thought that this movie would be so incredible! It has everything and more! How did they pull this off? Passion, courage, emotional strength, human spirit, love, drama, performances of a LIFETIME! All of it expertly choreographed to create the greatest movie of the year and maybe of the last decade. Admittedly, I went into it thinking it was going to be bad like everything else that comes out today in Hollywood, especially since it was a movie about a video game. But here I am after watching it feeling like it literally changed my life. How did they pull this off??? Holy hell it was good. Good job everyone that put effort into this!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),A Visually Stunning and Compelling Sequel,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film! First off, it is visually stunning, and it's evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into its creation. The visuals alone tell a compelling story of characters' emotions and set the tone for each scene. The cast, much like in the previous film, delivers outstanding performances, with Hailee Steinfeld particularly standing out in this one. The character progression of Miles from the first movie is a highlight, especially as the film places him at a crossroads. The soundtrack is among the best in recent memory, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll. The exploration of family themes is well-executed, although the second half slightly dips in this regard for the reviewer. The only downside I have is that much of the film's advertisement centered around the second half, which created a sense of having seen a huge portion of it already. The film also ends somewhat abruptly, but this is expected from the first part of a series. Overall, it stands as one of the best comic films to date in my opinion, and I think anyone could give it a watch, whether or not they enjoy superhero content."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),Nowhere near as good as the previous! Big disappointment!,"I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10... But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas. Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),"Probably a very VERY controversial opinion but.. oh well, whatever...","This movie has some of the most GORGEOUS animation and style that i've seen in a LONG time! The fact that someone DREW this is just INSANE?!! This movie is great and so. Has great characters, great story, FANTASTIC animations, and very good for being a super hero movie i guess. The ONLY negatives with this movie that i have is... 1. I think that the ending of the movie (the cliffhanger) was one of the most DISAPPOINTING things that i've EVER seen in a movie in a cinema. There was about to be an INSANE action scene! But of course.. there was a cliffhanger... 2. This movie DEFINITELY, in fact the 2 movies that we've got so far in the Miles Morales Spider-Man universe are CLEARLY aimed for a MUCH younger audience. Now this is ok. But the Tobey Maguire Era of Spider-Man was still VERY family friendly. Had maybe a few mild sad scenes and A BIT of blood, but otherwise the Tobey Maguire movies were GREAT, addicting and fun enough for the whole family. The Andrew Garfield Spider-Man Era, The (two, so far) Amazing Spider-Man movies aimed for a more OLDER audience. Maybe 11 and up with A LOT more blood and intense action scenes (thankfully not EVEN CLOSE to horror movie violence level), but still these movies had A LOT more violence and blood than the Tobey Maguire movies. The Tom Holland Era was also great. Probably one of my favourites with the most likeable characters and best storytelling (in my opinion). Spider-Man: No Way Home was one of the BEST cinema experiences that i've HAD! The Miles Morales Era is still GREAT, but I wish that they just aimed the movies on at least A LITTLE more to the older audience side, about to the Andrew Garfield era OR in the middle of the Tobey Maguire era and the Andrew Garfield Era. Otherwise this movie is GREAT! High hopes for the next movie!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),They delivered another gem - Wow!,"Sequels always suck. But this one doesn't disappoint one iota. Bravo! The beginning is so well crafted to shift the spotlight onto Spider Gwen. Her character keeps the Spiderverse accessible the female fanbase. Something that most fanboys won't recognize. I'm re-watching this movie with my 12 yr old daughter and she is transfixed. The whole adolescent and coming of age segments were also excellent. Lauren Velez, Bryan Henry and Shea Whigham really deliver an emotional anchor. Animation was pushed to the delicious limit and beyond. They have given the audience a feast to digest and happily dissect many times over. How in the universe do they follow this up with the 3rd?"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),Real Spider-Men Would Never Agree with 2099,"Following up the massive success of Into the Spider-Verse, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse takes the story further into the multiverse of everyone's favorite Wall Crawler. Achieving some of the greatest animation put to film, every moment of this movie is masterfully crafted to give each character and universe its own unique look and feel. It truly is remarkable how much work went into this, but also unfortunate that it landed the animators in such a difficult work environment. While all of the voice acting is phenomenal, my biggest issue comes in with the characters. First, taking a joke villain like the Spot and turning him into a truly creepy and powerful foe is no small feat and I commend the writers for pulling that off. The issue comes with Spider-Man, all of them. Besides Miles Morales, every version of Spider-Man is perverse with the out of line ideals of the Spider Society. There are no versions of Spider-Man that would ever stand by those ideals and it is wild how every current mainstream Spidey has lost the meaning of what the character stands for. I won't stand on my soapbox for long, but that is an issue I hope gets rectified in future appearances. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing sequel to a spectacular movie and, though I don't love the direction of the characters, I eagerly await the final chapter."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),Why do i feel like I'm missing something ?,"I feel like I've been missing something here, don't get me wrong the film is good but the way it's been hyped I kind of went in thinking it would be some sort of cinematic masterpiece. My hopes were high for this film seeing how well it has been received and the 8.5+ rating it has on imdb but although I enjoyed it I feel a bit underwhelmed. It's kind of what I felt for the first film. It's decent but not amazing. It's been a bit too overhyped in my opinion. I also don't like how long the second film was compared to the first one just for all of it too end up in a cliffhanger. But overall it's a good film that I would recommend."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),A Euphoric Viewing Experience,"Probably the best animated film I've ever seen, and unquestionably one of my favorite movies of the year. Like the first movie, the animation style is stunning - I love the vibrant color palette and the blend of hand-drawn elements with CGI. The visuals combined with Metro Boomin's soundtrack make for a euphoric viewing experience. This film is everything a sequel should be, by expanding the universe (or spiderverse in this case) while also delving deeper into the main character arcs. I was immersed in the story and wasn't ready for the movie to end when it did. The final installment of this trilogy can't come soon enough!"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),Visually breathtaking dopamine hack,"I can't remember who let the jinn out of the bottle for the first time with this multiverse extravaganza, but it's definitely the biggest cinematic trait of late. Everything Everywhere All at Once quite capitalised on it last Oscars season, so it's no surprise that the latest Spider-Man animated feature, which used the same tricks first, but maybe in a slightly more shambolic manner, is upping the ante. What used to be more of an acid trip back in 2018, is now a coherently crazy experience amplified 1000 times. Bearing traces of heavy influence from cyberpunk anime genre, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one hell of a never ending whirlwind of flickering coloured specks and hard beats. Multiply it by a variety of cultural references, a dozen different graphic styles and several languages changing fluidly into one another - and you'll end up with an absolute bomb that will blow your mind, in all ways good and bad. Visually, this film is a masterpiece. At least in the ""we've never seen anything like it"" sense. Yep, it's innovative, and probably not as vertigo-inducing as the first part, despite a sickening amount of action. It still doesn't make it easy to follow what's going on, but somehow the film retains your engagement, so you just go with the flow. And that's probably the biggest achievement for something that's quite chaotic and sensory overstimulating. Still, it feels like by overloading our senses with anime-like extremes, Spider-Man bypasses our prefrontal cortex and goes directly to ""the TikTok brain"" that's easily captivated by shiny moving things. So we end up having zero complaints eating subpar dialogues, classic cheap tricks like driving tension by artificially induced miscommunication, or single-agenda characters that follow their prescribed paths without deviation natural to real human beings. I can't deny that it felt good watching this film. But I am left with a tingling concern that it wasn't due to the complexity of emotions or a wide gamut of thoughts that it made us experience, but simply because our brains produced lots of happy chemicals in response to this sensory DDoS attack. Which, technically, is an achievement akin to the discovery of LSD, profound in its influence on the world. But, as with any real world drug, it makes you wonder: can feelings alone be trusted when evaluating the whole experience? Modern problems require modern solutions. Whether we like it or not, films like this one open a portal to a new era of cinema. Let's see what awaits on the other side."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),It was perfect. Everything,"This movie was one of the best movies I had ever watched. The music was great, the plot was well done and interesting, the story, the Spiderverse, the suprising plot twists, the voice acting, the villains and the action. Every single thing was great. The sad part is that it ends in a cliffhanger, after Gwen Stacy comes to rescue Miles Morales from Earth-42(an universe where Uncle Aaron is Miles' Dad and Miles is a bad guy)to his universe, hopefully the ""true"" Miles escaped the trap. The best part, in my opinion, was the chase. It was full of action, now I can't wait to see Spider-Man Beyond the Spiderverse."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023),The best movie to have ever come out!,"This movie is soo good it's ridiculous. That's all. Everything about it is perfect, how it's made, the effects, the plot, the soundtrack, the characters. It carries so much emotion and it takes you on a rollercoaster ride through out the entire movie. You are so connected to the charecters and understand each point of view. It's exiting, funny, emotional, immersive, original, visually stunning intriguing and unforgettable. There is no flaw in this movie, nothing could have been done better. Can't wait for the next one, although I have no idea how it will ever top this movie but I have really high expectations!"
The Hunger Games (2012),Beautiful,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's been one of my favorite movies of all time. The cinematography is great. An acting was phenomenal. It's like you can feel the characters emotions, and from someone who is read all the books I couldn't be any more happier with the final result of the movie. It's a great movie to sit down and watch with a teenager or preteen . Has slight talk alcohol and mild gore. Very emotional movie and brought me to tears and in the beginning , middle, and end . I recommend the whole hunger, games, franchise, and even the books. Couldn't be any better. Definitely recommend ."
The Hunger Games (2012),Not worthy of the Hunger Games Series!,"This was a terrible movie! A weak confusing plot, poor audio for the voices, a series of seemingly unrelated events. I loved the previous movies and was looking forward to this one. The female lead never touched a weapon yet survived a demolition of a building and 20 enemies with weapons who were finished off by a poisoned powder and 100's of snakes?????? An apparently completely incompetent Military Dictatorship didn't find hundreds of demolition explosives and cables in the most high profile building in the Capital??? Nothing about this script made any sense! Very strange and very disappointing for an otherwise fantastic franchise! How does anyone write a review without discussing the contents of the movie??"
The Hunger Games (2012),"This is Sad, Depressing, and Scary","The Hunger Games is an amazing movie. The book is better but this is still a really good movie. The Hunger Games is sad, depressing, and scary, but not in a bloody gory way. This movie can be very uncomfortable, but that is what makes this a good movie. If a movie is really sad, then that means it is a good movie because it gives you with strong feelings. The movie has good action and characters, but it is just very uncomfortable to watch. I am excited to watch the sequel, Catching Fire soon. I reccomend this movie to you if you like action and drama. What a good film. In all, I give this a 7.9 out of 10."
The Hunger Games (2012),Best film if the franchise,"By far, to my liking, this is the best film of all the Hunger Games saga. The history is good, the characters are all likable, the photography is also good and, above all, it is entertaining. I found myself at the end wishing for it to go on. It was a surprise to listen to Rachel's voice and it was even nicer to see that she can act. Violet put an extra value to the film and the Snow character played his part really well. He set foot for the future hateful Snow we all know. I feel that 7.0 is too low for this film. No way the other Hunger Games game can be better than this one. The other ones get boring at times, this was not the case with this one. Of course this is all in own personal opinion I strongly recommend this film. Cheers!"
The Hunger Games (2012),I rewatch the series every few years,"""The Hunger Games"" adeptly translates Suzanne Collins' dystopian narrative to the screen, and Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen is nothing short of exceptional. The film skillfully captures the stark societal contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the destitution in the Districts, creating a compelling visual landscape. The movie successfully balances action with emotional resonance, exploring complex themes such as power dynamics and survival strategies. James Newton Howard's musical score enhances the cinematic experience, adding emotional weight to key moments. The pace keeps you hooked, and the characters are so relatable. Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson kill it in their roles. Plus, the friendships and alliances in the Hunger Games add so much depth. Let's talk character relationships - it's not just about Katniss being a badass. The bonds formed during the Hunger Games are raw and real. You've got Katniss and Peeta playing the crowd, Katniss and Rue's genuine connection - it hits you right in the feels. And the mentor-student dynamic with Haymitch adds this whole other layer."
The Hunger Games (2012),The Ultimate Reality Television Show,"At the centre of ""The Hunger Games"" is an idea also found in other movies such as ""Rollerball"" and ""The Running Man"", namely that of an authoritarian government using violent entertainment as a means of distracting the attention of the populace away from its misdeeds. It is an idea that probably derives from memories of classics lessons at school and that quip from Juvenal's satires about Roman emperors providing their subjects with ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses), although it is not one that has been generally borne out by modern totalitarian states. The film is set at some time in the distant future in the Republic of Panem, a state situated somewhere in what is today the USA. (The name of the country is an obvious reference to Juvenal's quip quoted above). The Hunger Games of the title is an annual event which commemorates an unsuccessful rebellion 74 years earlier against the country's central government. Each of the twelve districts which participated in the revolt is compelled to send two teenagers, one male and one female, to the nation's capital. These young people, known as ""tributes"", are forced to fight to the death in an arena. The event, televised for the entertainment of the people of Panem, and is hugely popular; those who regard the idea as unutterably cruel are afraid to voice their opposition publicly as the despotic government does not take kindly to any criticism. The main character is Katniss Everdeen, a working-class girl living in the impoverished District 12, an area of small farmers and coal miners. (Despite modern concerns about fossil fuels and global warming, it would seem that coal mining is still a major industry in Panem). When Katniss's younger sister Primrose is selected as one of District 12's tributes, Katniss selflessly volunteers to take her place. The film then follows what happens to Katniss when she travels to the capital, and the complications which arise when she falls in love with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from her district. (That's how the name is spelt in the cast list, although when watching the film I assumed he was called ""Peter""). Both the original ""Rollerball"" from 1975 and ""The Running Man"" from 1987 were made before the current vogue for ""reality"" television. (I put that word in inverted commas because ""reality"" shows are one of the most phoney and unreal things on the box. Much more unreal than good honest fiction). They can, however, be seen as prescient in the way they seemed to predict it, especially ""The Running Man"". ""The Hunger Games"" was made after the ""reality"" revolution, and the satire against this genre is quite obvious. ""Reality"" shows might not involve ritualised killing, and for the most part they do not involve physical violence, but they often involve verbal violence and public humiliation, and pander to milder versions of the sadism and voyeurism which motivate the spectators seen in the film. In my view ""The Hunger Games"" is better than either the original ""Rollerball"" or ""The Running Man"", and far better than the dismal ""Rollerball"" remake from 2002. (About which the less said the better). ""Rollerball"" is OK as an action movie about a violent sport, but works less well as a political satire, which was its main raison d'etre. ""The Running Man"" falls into the trap of becoming the thing it is satirising; the film is supposed to be a satire on violent and exploitative entertainment, but ends up becoming violent and exploitative entertainment itself. The main characters of both films, Jonathan E in ""Rollerball"" and Ben Richards in ""The Running Man"", are little more than ciphers who exist because the film needs a hero in order to make its point. ""The Hunger Games"", by contrast, gives us two well-rounded characters in Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, characters who are more than just ciphers and with whom we can sympathise and identify. There is also a good performance from Donald Sutherland as Coriolanus Snow, the cynical and autocratic President of Panem. (To stress the link with the Roman Empire, most of Panem's social elite have Roman-derived forenames; we also meet a character called Seneca Crane). Unlike ""The Running Man"" the film does not idealise or romanticise violence; the organisers of the Games might talk about the ""courage"" and ""sacrifice"" of the tributes, but the film shows the Games for what they are, the savage and completely unnecessary slaughter of frightened young people. I am not normally a big fan of ongoing film franchises, but having seen ""The Hunger Games"" I might give the later episodes a chance. 7/10."
The Hunger Games (2012),A Fantastic Adaptation with Strong Performances and Tension,"The Hunger Games is a fantastic adaptation of the book. It successfully captures the essence of the story and characters, even if some aspects feel rushed. The film effectively hits emotional beats and constructs an interesting universe worth exploring. Its strongest point lies in the performances. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss Everdeen, delivering great acting and successfully manages to bring the complex character to life. Josh Hutcherson is decent as Peeta Mellark, and Woody Harrelson stands out as my personal favorite, bringing fun depth and complexity to Haymitch. The well-written plot, along with good pacing and editing, keeps the tension high, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Overall, I think both book lovers, as well as general audiences could find something to really enjoy here."
The Hunger Games (2012),Intense and thrilling,"Although starting off quite slow, The Hunger Games is a thrilling and intense movie that keeps your heart beating. Set in a dystopian world where society is divided into multiple different districts according to the needs of their society. Katniss Everdeen, member of the 12th district and protagonist, is suddenly selected to participate in the annual battle royale (the hunger games), where she and Peeta, another member of district 12, must both survive in the harsh wilderness, fighting against the natural elements as well as the rest of the selected participants. A good movie with thrilling action, however a noticeable problem with the film was its pacing. The first hour started off quite slow introducing the characters whereas the second hour and a half felt somewhat rushed. Still a enjoyable movie for those who like thrilling action."
The Hunger Games (2012),Thriller,"The movies are amazing, but like with most movies based off of novels that leave out many details. If you haven't read the series I strongly suggest you should. I can't get enough of it. I've read every book my family owns and out of all of them this series is my favorite. I can't get enough of it.

The Hunger Games (2012),best movie,"""The Hunger Games"" is a gripping dystopian adventure directed by Gary Ross, adapted from Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel. Set in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, the film follows Katniss Everdeen, portrayed with intensity by Jennifer Lawrence, as she volunteers to take her sister's place in the annual Hunger Games-a televised fight to the death among young tributes from each district. The film's strength lies in its world-building, presenting a bleak yet fascinating vision of a society divided into districts ruled by the Capitol. The Hunger Games themselves are a brutal spectacle, and Ross captures the tension and drama adeptly. Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the resilient and resourceful Katniss anchors the narrative, bringing depth to the character. The supporting cast, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, adds layers to the story. Stanley Tucci's flamboyant portrayal of Caesar Flickerman and Elizabeth Banks' eccentric Effie Trinket contribute to the film's satirical commentary on reality television and the manipulation of public sentiment. Visually, the film is striking, with the stark contrast between the opulence of the Capitol and the poverty of the districts. The action sequences are well-executed, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. James Newton Howard's musical score enhances the emotional beats, creating a powerful atmosphere. While ""The Hunger Games"" successfully introduces audiences to the harsh reality of Panem and establishes Katniss as a formidable protagonist, some may find the shaky camera work during action scenes distracting. Additionally, the film leaves certain aspects of the source material unexplored, assuming familiarity with the book. In summary, ""The Hunger Games"" is a compelling adaptation that sets the stage for the franchise. With its strong performances, thought-provoking themes, and visually arresting presentation, it remains a noteworthy entry in the dystopian film genre, offering both entertainment and social commentary."
The Killer (2023),The Killer review,"First and foremost, I would like to commend David Fincher for his direction of this movie, his razor-sharp execution and storytelling, and Michael Fassbender's enigmatic performance as the cold, yet human lead character. And yet, while this resonates with anyone who understands and respects Fincher's techniques and visions, it didn't do well in appeals to others who expect so much in the action genre. Overall, the pacing of this movie might turn people off. And I understand that reaction. The pacing of this movie is not the same as John Wick or any action movies you are familiar with. Instead, the focus of it is mainly about the main character, The Killer. Throughout the movie, The Killer is characterized in a way that we understand his philosophy, his motivation, and the inner conflict inside him. However, all that being said, I do think the movie has dropped its ball on the story. While the well-made execution compensates the watching experience, I can't say lightly about the simplicity and lack of stakes of the storytelling. Other than the fruitful effort of fostering the suspense, the main treats are the captivating performances (particularly Fassbender and Tilda Swinton) If you truly appreciate David Fincher for his craft, then you will find this movie very engaging."
The Killer (2023),Not what you think it is,"I screened David Fincher's ""The Killer"" tonight, which is just sublime. It is NOT, however, an ""action"", ""adventure"" or ""crime"" film as labelled by IMDb. While it may have some elements of those genres, it is a deeply moving, sarcastic, soul-probing character study. The score consists almost entirely of songs by The Smiths, played by the title character in a perfectly calibrated performance by Michael Fassbender. There are wildly funny moments. In her 10 minutes onscreen (less?), second-billed Tilda Swinton, who makes a very, very, very, very, very late entrance, is in absolute top form, and tells a joke so funny I had to stop the film to recover from laughter. She also has all-time great Last Words. This is not a film for action movie fans. Those who like cerebral, deep screenplays which keep you thinking throughout and after, this is a great surprise and gift from Fincher."
The Killer (2023),Boring,"It starts off well but it gets nowhere. Plot is not interesting and main character barely speaks the whole movie. There is a narrative voice of his but he has no dialogues with anybody, he does not even say thank you, when he should, what is quite annoying. Another annoying thing I noticed in his behaviour, he has zero facial expressions and he stretches his neck every few minutes. I wondered if this was invented by Michael or somebody told him to do it. I really have no idea what is the value in it. So, as you can see, this movie is so predictable, boring and flat, that instead of enjoying it, you start finding those strange annoying details. At the same time you wait for something interesting to happen but it never does. Skip this one."
The Killer (2023),Nonsense,"Took me ages to get through this boring display. I'm a big fan of Fincher's previous work with great stories, plots and characters. This one baffles me a bit. It feels like the writers are very young, have no life experience or just don't have the imagination to pull this off. Even the smallest details bother me. The plot relies on stupidity. Some examples. Pressure washing the inside of a car, going on a ferry to dump things where there's certain to be people, I could go on and on. The acting is okay. I like the ambience. It could have been pretty great if it weren't for the stupidity factor driving the plot. If you want a great assassin thriller, don't watch this
If you want to preserve your adoration of David Fincher, dont watch this
If I could recommend anything else in this genre it would be Léon: The Professional."
The Killer (2023),Winner,"David Fincher is one of my favourite if not my favourite director. He showed his brilliance in this film too, like in Fight Club, the Se7en, and the Zodiac. This movie was perfect for me. An upset hitman who goes after the bad guys. The acting was almost perfect, so as the actors. I think Michael Fassbender was a great pick to be the main character. It was a great movie to whatch, definetly will watch later again, however it lacked the plot so this film is not for Plot-Lovers. It is slow as a snail but that is why i liked it. The planning than the execution. This is how every assasin movie should be. Fincher did it again."
The Killer (2023),Stylish but pointless,"The first 15 minutes gives one hope that this is going to be a great movie with interesting character development, some insight into the mind of an assassin, the cold-blooded killing machine too often portrayed in movies as a cipher (the relentless killer, a trope, is invariable a person lacking certain all-too-human characteristics). And then, unfortunately, the lead character turns into just another formulaic relentless killer. The fact that he finally finds himself unable to suppress a certain vengeafulness is mildly interesting, but character development essentially stops about a third of the way through. After that you might as well be watching Vin Diesel. It's a pity, because Michael Fassbender and David FIncher could have done so much more with this."
The Killer (2023),Meh,"A 5 star id a mediocre review because it's a mediocre movie. Would I watch again? No. Would I recommend it? Not really. If you have absolutely nothing else to do or watch then ok, but nothing about this character is interesting. You will not get invested in the plot because it's basic, I like Michael Fassbender but I have to say this is probably one of the worst he has starred in. Late night viewing to help you sleep is what I would say this is good for, 1 hour and 59 minutes. You will wonder why you didn't turn it off, I know I did, but it's good background if you are a multitasker because you only need to listen."
The Killer (2023),Artistic Wick,"Limited cinema release is always a worry, particularly when we are talking about one of the best directors of all time. So it is on the small screen that most of us watched David Fincher's The Killer. And the results are mixed. Reviews are either an over the top 10 or an immature 1. My review is somewhere in the middle. Michael Fassbender plays the titular Killer as an icy reptile, obsessed with his process and set of guidelines like some kind of advanced Dexter Morgan. His latest assignment has gone wrong, and apparently his superiors aren't happy. Fincher's artistic attempt at a John Wick/Kill Bill style caper has moments of genius, flashes of mastery and stretches of boredom. The Killer is not for everyone, and maybe not even for every Fincher disciple. I liked it, but it's not worthy of the wider Fincher library. 7/10."
The Killer (2023),Killer,"This movie is great,but maybe lacks some finishing at the end,the ending what is what a movie gets remeberd for,not the beginning but the end. The movie is overall great but not that great i would watch it but not again and again maybe like other movies,but atleast everyone has its own taste about like and not like so i understand and so must every producer and director on the movie front. But its their job to understand these things and to waits for this you musnt just think everything is all rose you must undderstnad that part also because its part of your job to understand these things all so yah thats how it."
The Killer (2023),"Nobody's perfect - neither the Killer, nor Mr. Fincher","I believe one of the biggest mistakes in the script was the fact that the killer has a great, open, well-lit view of the other apartment's interiors. I mean, don't people draw the curtains in this part of the world or what? Besides, the guy who is supposed to be hit has come there in absolute secrecy to indulge in his fantasies and he prefers the curtains drawn? And what does his bodyguard do immediately after the killer shoots and misses (killing the woman?) What do you know, he draws the curtains! Also, he botches up an assignment and they send assassins to bump off his girlfriend! And they botch up too! So why didn't they send another assasin to bump them off? And somebody please tell me, after he fails to kill his target and scoots off literally on his scooter, did I see the police cars actually chasing him? I mean, hadn't they just arrived possibly after someone called 911? How could they suddenly assume ""Yonder! That guy on the scooter, he's the killer! Let's chase the fella!' and go after him? C'mon Mr. Fincher. This is what happens when you're considered a legend and people just lap up whatever you create. Nobody questions you. Including you."
Wonka (2023),"Great movie, better than Depps","Pros
Great characters, virtually like everyone. Very good casting
Nearly all the songs were brilliant
Aesthetically pleasing. Very colourful sets
Lauren said it was whimsy, witful and cheeky. Excellent complements
Great for an audience of all ages Negatives
Didn't like Matt Lucas - very lack luster with repeating jokes. So annoying when the other 2 actors of the trio were fantastic
The little girls storyline just didn't need to be there. Her relation and how it played out, if you removed it from the movie, would have changed nothing. Very minor but the bit of overacting the second the chocolate went in there movie. Amazing movie, just slightly out of that legendary status for us."
Wonka (2023),Absolutely Fantastic,"When I read some of the other reviews, I was quite surprised. The acting is superb, the storyline compelling and the music made the movie! I cannot understand why anyone would think negatively about this movie. This fine film was exactly what you expect it to be, magical. The story beautifully ties into the original Roald Dahl story as well as the 1971 Gene Wilder movie version. It completely delivers; ""Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination..."" highly recommended for adults and children of all ages. There are quite a few ""Easter Eggs"" that reference both the book and movie classic. This is a must see and sure to become a true classic."
Wonka (2023),A jovial ride.,"Wonka is a definition of a feel-good movie. I've entered it with completely no expectations on the second day of Christmas, and it was a perfect ending to the festive season. Don't get me wrong, Wonka doesn't discover any new ground, nor do its characters deliver spectacular performances. Timothée Chalamet is a perfect fit for a young, wonky Wonka (forgive me the pun). He's charming, fun, full of warmth, and actually sings well. He just fits the goofy role, like everybody in the cast. What stood out for me in Wonka was the film's songs. I don't know, maybe I'm just a sucker for musicals, but I can't recall humming so many songs from the previous iterations of the franchise. They're truly cheerful and stay in your head days after you leave the cinema. Oh, and Hugh Grant singing Oompa Loompa is just straight up living rent free in my head ever since. Another thing worth noting on its own are the movies' costumes. Warner Bros really outdid themselves on this one, and the team behind them deserves a recognition in awards. Wonka marketing team knew releasing the movie in December is a bullseye. In a period so overloaded with shopping, running errands, and overstuffing yourself with Christmas food, it was an ideal ending to the festive season to myself personally--and I'm certain for lots of other folks as well."
Wonka (2023),This is my favourite movie in cinemas lately.,"This is a very enchanting movie. I would even say that is even better than the movie this based on. I know that is unpopular opinion. But that is what I think. But the only reason I didn't rate this 10/10 is because that the ending is extremely weird. As the chocolate maker competitors sentence Willy and his friend , noddle to death by chocolate.l find this scene weird, funny and emotional. Death by chocolate is basically drowning in melted chocolate from there spare chocolate supply . But next bit is every emotional because Willy eats his mother's chocolate for the first time in years. Also the soundtrack is superb 👌. Victoria."
Wonka (2023),Like being in a beautiful dream for 2 hours,"I was so pleased with this movie. I loved pretty much every song in it. It was truly delightful. Being tossed in a dream and forgetting your reality for a few hours is how this made me feel. Want to see it in theaters again. Honestly I haven't seen many movies with Timothy Chamalet yet, this one made me love him. His voice is beautiful and he played a very great Willy Wonka. I feel like he captured the Gene Wilder version of Wonka very well. My favorite parts were when he did the same things Gene Wilder did. It was nostalgic but also brand new. Actually it kind of felt like I was hunting for Easter eggs throughout the film. Definitely see it! Worth your time."
Wonka (2023),Amazing! Someone finally found out how to add to a previously existing movie without destroying it!,"This movie was fun, sweet, and interesting. I laughed out loud more than once and wasn't pulled out of the story by anything shoved into the movie that didn't belong. They were able to include nods to and bits from the 1971 movie without it feeling like nothing more than a cheap play on the audience's emotions to grab more cash. There was an absolutely stellar cast of well-known names and faces. They all worked together beautifully with an expertly crafted script under a magnificent director. The only major flaw with this movie is the advertising! I only recall seeing 1 ad for this movie and thought it was just another remake of the Charlie story. I went because my kids wanted to and went in knowing very little about it. I was absolutely thrilled with the entire movie and am looking forward to seeing it again!"
Wonka (2023),A fun prelude that does a good enough job,"""Wonka"" a movie directed by Paul King, starring Timothee Chalamet, who plays Willy Wonka, is a prelude to the later movie with Gene Wilder. It is a musical adventure movie with fun characters, some comedy, and lots of chocolate. To start off, I don't think this movie can compare to the amazing music, acting, and setting of Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory (1971), however it does a pretty good job. The story is fun and it works, however it is very cheesy. Unbearabley cheesy at times, which took a mark off for me. It was however bearable by the ending of the movie which to me was super well done. The music itself was okay, though what was fun about it was how it linked bits and pieces of it to the songs in the 1971 WWATCF. Making it relatable and fun. All around the movie was good and I recommend for families."
Wonka (2023),Just fantastic,"I thought the film was beautiful. It's full of great music, has a great cast, and is a lot of fun. And thought Timothee Chalamet was spectacular. Only thing I can remember seeing him before was Dune and wasn't a big fan, but he won me over here. I went into this having seen not a single preview/trailer, so I fully expected this to be the same familiar story, retold. It was not, and I was pleasantly surprised. Loved that by itself, but I also really enjoyed the story they gave us. Character development is essential and many artists/creators lately forget about that. So this was a nice change of pace."
Wonka (2023),A Deliciously Delightful Cinematic Confection,"Warner Bros. Pictures' 'Wonka' chronicles the rise of the famous titular chocolatier from his humble beginnings to the man we know in the classic 1971 film. Along the way he encounters some kindred spirits, a few less-than-honorable rival chocolate makers, a chocoholic priest, and even a giraffe. The film tells an uplifting, emotional story that had me grinning from ear to ear one minute and getting choked up the next. This is complemented by an abundance of extremely creative musical numbers that you will no doubt be humming for days. The songs and plot perfectly blend together to create a fun, whimsical tone that carries through the entire film. Timothée Chalamet absolutely shines as the wacky yet good-hearted young Willy Wonka, proving that not only can he act, but this guy's got some pipes too! I was captivated by his performance from the second he appeared onscreen till the credits rolled. Not to be outdone though, the cast includes some other talented standouts, such as Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman), and the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key). I also have to give a shout out to Hugh Grant's Oompa-Loompa and his perfect delivery of the character's deadpan humor. While I was looking forward to seeing 'Wonka', I left the theater with my expectations exceeded. It's easily the feel-good movie of the year, regardless of your age. The filmmakers mixed a tablespoon of fun, an ounce of heart, a pinch of inspiration, and a heaping cup of joy to create a deliciously delightful cinematic confection that will transport you to a world of pure imagination."
Wonka (2023),Cute,"I'm a major Gene and Johnny supporter of the Wonka character and I honestly thought Jeremy, from The Bear would make an excellent Wonka. But after watching this film, I think it was created perfectly. I laughed, I was invested, I was annoyed, and I found my heart melting. Not going lie, it got a tear out of me as well. I am not BIG on going to the theater and spending money on any film that I can just wait to watch at home but being a Wonka lover, I could NOT say no. Glad I did and even though there were children adding to scenes in their seats at this theater, it added and did not take away a single moment of the film. I am NOT a huge fan of musicals, but this was so cute and lovable."
Barbie (I) (2023),A Thought-Provoking Tale with Vibrant Visuals and Stellar Performances,"Barbie is an incredible movie that will entertain, as long as you can understand the lessons that modern society should learn and not get triggered. It aims to speak about the complexities of the relationship between men and women in our world in a simple and understandable way. I truly believe that everyone should watch the film, but if I had to pick a specific group to tell, I would choose late adolescence and above women. I believe the film's message will both speak to them where they may currently find themselves in life as well as lead them to reflect on their past hurt and misunderstandings as well as their future. Besides all of that, the soundtrack of this movie is energetic and grasps people into the film right away. The vibrant colors and impressive prop design deserve a lot of credit as it makes everything feel alive. The script is written perfectly for most characters, and everything is enhanced by the actors. Margot Robbie plays her role perfectly, hitting each theme that Barbie must take in perfectly. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic supporting actor, taking the silliness and seriousness of Ken to great areas in a simple and fun way. America Ferrera is great and delivers one of the most powerful performances in 2023. Ariana Greenblatt is fantastic as a growing teen in need of a lesson, and everyone else does a great job also, doing whatever they needed to do. One of my biggest issues with the film is the plotline involving Will Ferrell. Although I love him, I felt that the plot involving Mattel padded the runtime and did not do anything for me that was truly impactful the way everything else in the movie was. Overall, it is a must-watch, and if you get yourself in the right mindset and open yourself to its themes, this may have you in tears."
Barbie (I) (2023),Barbie's Bait & Switch,"Quality acting that was believable and made a connection with the audience. Visually stimulating and good world-building while establishing rules governing Barbie Land versus reality. The topics addressed are important conversation starters, questioning societal and personal issues. At times it may portray a narrow, negative, one-dimensional portrayal for some of the characters. Later in the film portions of the dialogue gets preachy which takes away from the energy of the movie leaving the viewer feeling deflated. Also, there's no significant resolution among the conflicting parties. Furthermore, it pushes a zero sum game instead of cooperation. Lastly, Marketed like fun for the whole family but probably not the best entertainment for some family structures and age groups."
Barbie (I) (2023),A comedy that wants to be political,"But fails. Honestly if you just watch the first 2/3 and then turn it off, you'd be doing yourself a favor. Long dead are the days of entertainment for the sake of entertainment, I'm mostly desensitized to the contrived narratives by this point. The movie was for the most part enjoyable before they stopped trying to be funny all together, which was a shame. Obviously I didn't have my hopes up after the lizzo song was playing, and it just sounding like a bunch of forced mainstream narratives. But this did get worse over time. The amazing aesthetic choices, colorful set pieces and comedic decisions made my experience overall positive, although I'm the last person to be excited for more corporate, regurgitated identity politics in what should be a harmless show."
Barbie (I) (2023),Biggest Movie but not the best of 2023,"Barbie was definitely the biggest movie to come out in 2023, with the hype train in full flow before the release. The cast was perfect and the soundtrack across multiple artists all running to get a bite of the cherry was also quite good, most hit the charts upon release. The story of the film hits home the meaning of Barbie, on how she can be anything or do any career she wants to do in a time when Barbie was released as a toy, women were still trying to get a foot on the world and this really hits home in the film. Very good ending and our stereotypical Barbie is actually the least stereotypical as she gains a form of conscience after embarking out into the real world and begins to question her existence. Definitely the biggest release of 2023, a very funny and quirky adaption of our well known Toy Barbie."
Barbie (I) (2023),This is not a Barbie film - watch Life Size instead,"This movie is all about Ken. And this was a very big issue for me as it was so hyped up to be a 'feminist' film. Was there a big Barbie production number with Margot Robbie singing? Ken has - at least two big song and dance numbers. Sure it started with Barbie asking who she really is, but in the end it was Ken who asked the big questions and got some answers too - if you could even find your way into this mess of a fluff. At least this film have taught me that if a movie is too heavily promoted which even included a Barbie burger meal set or Barbie milk tea, it must be that desperate to sell because it must be that bad."
Barbie (I) (2023),Way too much in this movie to be described in 600 words.,"As in 2001, the first 5 minutes sums up the entire movie. And like 2001, you will be asked to think, and think in unconventional ways outside your usual comfort zone(s). It doesn't matter what particular side of the Great Debate you are on, or think you are on, this movie will ask you questions honestly and difficult. And will ask you to be honest in answering them for yourself. All the while, the humour is both gentle and subtle, a very British reading of the Barbie story. Reading some of the commens on this board, it is clear that Barbie does not fall into trap of fulfilling expectations. We can leave that to movies like Saving Private Ryan. Barbie a courage all of its challenge in different ways. It is unfortunate but not unexpected that in 2023 there are so many who prefer the comfort of their own dollhouses. The following may be spoilers:
Kudos to Mattel for having the honesty and courage to laugh at its corporate self. Was Gosling channeling his inner. Michael Flately for one scene and. Zefran Cochrane for another.? And yes, it's part documentary."
Barbie (I) (2023),Still don't really know what to think of this movie,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago. I didn't really know what to think of it and even after a few days of gentle reflection I haven't been able to draw a definite conclusion. It is quite silly, over the top, laughable, ridiculous, cute and charming on the one hand. On the other hand it does have a deeper message and a good one as well. Because it the story is so over the top and quite hysterical, it really shows you well how conservative en patriarchic standards are still dictating our society. Maybe it needs to be portrayed in such a maner to wake us up. The mirror is funny, but harsh at the same time. Some friends are a huge fan ans some are definitely not. I am somewhat in the middle, but am still ruminating."
Barbie (I) (2023),Fun for the hype,"I might be one of the last people on the planet to see this movie, I deliberately held off because of the hype. I ended up caving and I'm glad I did and let the period of high expectations pass. This meant I could enjoy it for what it is which is lots of fun. The political messages were present but not too in your face, more a sort of background thought as you leave the cinema. As a 49 year old woman I can't say it spoke to me deeply or shocked nd surprised me any way but I did get some laughs. Margot and Ryan are brilliant and I'm sure will soon be reunited in a prequel or sequel. Calling it now."
Barbie (I) (2023),I'm so glad I waited until it was released on HBO Max and I can't believe everyone claims it's for adults,"With all the hype about this movie I was really tempted to see it on the big screen. Not for kids, deep and funny? Count me in! I just didn't get around to seeing it and I'm so glad. It would obviously bore young children, but how did it not bore every other adult as well? What a lame comedy-only one scene made me chuckle, the rest of the ""funny"" parts made me roll my eyes. I'd say it's more of a tween movie, or even teen if you keep them under a rock. But I don't know what the excuse is for adults thinking it's an amazing, brilliant comedy. And the whole deep part was pretty lame as soon as we saw that Barbie realized that the real world isn't how it is in hers."
Barbie (I) (2023),Better than Oppenheimer,"This is by far not the perfect movie, but I enjoyed it more than Oppenheimer, which I was not able to finish. This movie is definitely head above a lot of other media in terms of attention to little details and the costumes. Loved this side of it, and I remember seeing lots of YouTube videos that went over all the details and how they are connected to real life or to other media. It also has a really good pacing, and overall feels more like an adult fairytale. Which may not be something for everyone, obviously. I remember when it just came out a lot of people were praising the show for how females are portrayed, and bashed it for how males are portrayed. And there were some who did the reverse. I would say that both sides are correct. Not to go too much into details, patriarchy is depicted as the evil of the world, and matriarchy is the only way to save it. This is not only not true, but it is also shallow, and ignoring real examples of matriarchic rule. At the same time, the movie does touch upon real issues that men face in real life, like the need to fight for even a slither of attention. This is good, but it gets kind of brushed off at the end, almost as if it did not matter, that that's what brought about Kendome. ""Kenough"" shirt is a good message, but it gets overpowered by the main message, that it is enough for women to just be ordinary. Which is also a good message, but...
The movie just forgot that in reality you need equality. You need both sides to be present and finding common ground. It is ok to be ordinary for both sides, and both sides can do amazing things. To be honest, for more than first half of the movie, I thought that would be the final message, but in the end it was muddied by ""women are better"", which felt disingenuous and worsened overall experience. The final scene, though did even more damage, but maybe I just did not get it, since I am a guy. Either way, it was more or less an enjoyable experience. Overhyped? Probably yes. Worth a watch? Also, probably yes, if you temper your expectations."
Elf (2003),Hilarious,"I've watched it about few times I think and it's kinda hilarious. It always cracks me up. The acting is great especially from Will Farrell himself. He sure did a great job for playing as Buddy, a main protagonist. It's probably one of the funniest Christmas films of all time and it's probably one of the best Christmas films of all time as well. It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic. The character Buddy himself is just mad as a hatter, isn't he? I watched it for the first time on DVD in late November 2004 when I was fourteen years old. If you enjoy watching Christmas films, you'll definitely love this."
Elf (2003),Pure Christmas Magic,"Elf is full to the brim with Christmas spirit. It would not be the Christmas season without watching it multiple times. Will Ferrell gives 100% to the role of Buddy and the supporting cast is excellent. The filmmakers could have gone real raunchy with the movie and I'm so glad that they didn't. Rather than rely on cheap humor, the bits in this movie are quick, witty and hilarious. Along with Home Alone and a few other family favorites, this is one of the most quoted movies in my house. I haven't even mentioned the brilliance of the score by John Debney... Perfect! Take the nostalgia out of it and this movie is still, pure magic. It's a story of hope, belonging and having a positive outlook on life. Best Character: Buddy
Best Quote: ""The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear."" - Buddy
Best Scene: ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town""
Best Piece of Score: ""Main Title"""
Elf (2003),A Children's Movie for Children! How Refreshing!,"Too many of today's kiddie movies opt for adult jokes, and ""slip in' offer-color humor that they think the kids won't get--too often we get kid's movies about pee, poo, farts and anything some overgrown adult-child in Hollywood will get a laugh. This film demonstrates how innocent childlike behavior that is silly can be fun, about how misplaced priorities by adults can be redirected when they tune into what the child professes and, more importantly, loves. The relationship beetween Elf Will and James Cann his father provides a perfect example---adults will appreciate that Caan is remembered for several violent Hollywood classics, but kids don't care, and completely understand when Will is shunned by his Dad--who does come around. Casting Asner as Santa is genius, and the redecoration of Gimbel's classic hilarity--
And--this is really important--the film is EXCITING!"
Elf (2003),My all time favorite Christmas classic!,"Elf is such a good movie! This fish out of water story is hilarious! Will Ferrell is in his element and the whole cast as well cast and do a great job! I really have no complaints with this heartwarming film. I watch it every year, frequently on Christmas Eve. The comedy is on point, Jon Favreau hits the nail on the head I love how the North Pole is inspired by the classic Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The message if priorities in life, with the growth of Walter as a character is a common but good message. If you have not seen Elf, you are missing out! This has become a Christmas tradition for many for a reason!"
Elf (2003),Top 5 Christmas movie.,"Elf is a film I watched pretty late in my life. I never grew up with it, I was always a Home Alone person, but a couple years ago, I watched Elf for the first time, and I completely fell in love with, and I watch it every Christmas since. Will Ferrell brings to life this pleasant character that brought so many smiles to so many people's faces. This film gave us lots of iconic moments, such as Buddy the elf eating spaghetti with maple syrup and marshmallows, and the ""Thanks, Mr. Narwhal!"". Jon Favreau is notorious for making The Lion King live action remake which was pretty terrible, but don't forget he made gems like this."
Elf (2003),First Timer,"After all these years, I finally thought I should have a look at this, since so many people I know have it at the top of their Christmas movie list. I enjoyed some of it, but it is entirely predictable, schmaltzy, and doesn't really off much of a message. My favorite part was Bob Newhart explaining about the three thing that elves can aspire to. Otherwise we have the old father-who-works-too-hard bit as he ignores his son and tries (gasp) to earn money. Will Farrell is pretty funny at times, but his incessant talking and ridiculous actions started to lose me. There was never any doubt that he would be accepted, the boy would get his father back, and all would turn out well. At least now I can talk intelligently about it. I wouldn't have it in my top ten holiday films, but it's a decent film."
Elf (2003),Christmas Classic,"Will Ferrell stars brilliant in one of the best Christmas movies you will ever see. It is probably the first memory I have of him in a movie as that was the best Christmas film from when I was younger. Elf has it all from comedy to a good story and obviously a happy ending. It can be watched casually or as an endless tradition on Christmas Eve. It is hard to point out anything more that could have been done in the film. As a brief plot, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers that he is a human living in the North Pole with Santa's Elves. Upon discovering that he is human and has a real dad in New York, he attempts to become part of his family in time for Christmas, but obviously the way of living between elves and human is quite different. A couple of iconic scenes for me include the eating of chewing gum on the streets of New York thinking that is free candy, and also the scene featuring the dwarf as he mistakes him for an elf."
Elf (2003),A Surprisingly Christmas Movie Turned Into an All Time Holiday Classic,"This movie has turned into such an awesome holiday classic of all times now. Will Ferrell is an absolute genius in his ability to bring such warmth, humor, love, belonging, and unique character to this movie. That's what made it such a classic. Will and Faizon love were perfect in the rolls they played in each scene. The innocence of youth longing to love and be loved is something else Will brings to the scene in such a unique way in his ability to capture the hope in everyone's heart. That hope is a reality that comes to life during the holiday season with family, relatives, extended family, and special long time relationships with friends."
Elf (2003),"I like this movie, but not as much as others","I like Elf. I enjoy watching Elf. I find this movie amusing. However, I don't like it as much as many other people do, and that seems to turn them into angry elves. Will Ferrell's enthusiasm as he plays Buddy the Elf is contagious, and you can't help but smile at his innocent ignorance. James Caan also plays the part of the reluctant father so well that you wonder if he's actually going to kill Buddy. Where this modern Christmas classic starts to wear out its welcome is the ending, which unfortunately gets a little too cheesy for me. I'm happy to watch Elf every now and then, but not every year."
Elf (2003),"Funnyish, but is it Christmas Funny or Ferrel Funny?","Undeniably there are a few laughs in Elf. And it has a decent soundtrack that has lots of festive tunes to keep the yuletide feel alive. Now a few might argue with my reasoning here. But the biggest drawback for me is the rewatchability. Take Scrooged with Bill Murray as an example. I will never , ever tire of seeing the ghost of Christmas present smash Bill Murrays face with a toaster. Still laugh as hard every year. Elf unfortunately for me, made me laugh the first time. But Subsequent viewings don't bring the same enjoyment as the jokes are ""seen it, heard it"" and have limited replay value. I did enjoy the movie and Ferrel. Love him or loathe him, does what he does best and borders on the farcical with a style that only he can provide. Perhaps that's the problem. Ferrel's rewatchability in most of his work is not the easiest as his work depends a lot on the shock factor which diminishes each time you see it. A movie like Airplane I could watch countless times and still be amused. Elf for me is only slightly rewatchable and If it wasn't for my Daughter wanting to watch in 2023. I would have probably past it by this year."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),"Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal.","This is a very well-made and funny movie which meets all expectations. I guarantee that you will love it and it is the funniest family-friendly movie I've ever seen, besides Home Alone 1, that is. It's a very unique movie and had probably some of the best editing in a 1990s movie I've ever seen. The plot twists, character development, comedy and overall story blows me away. A lot funnier than most Christmas movies. This is coming from the perspective of a person who has very high standards and expectations when it comes to movies, especially festive movies. So sit back, relax, grab a snack of some sort and have fun watching the funniest Christmas movie available."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),"Christmas Classic, part II","Home Alone 2: Lost In New York picks up exactly where Home Alone left off. The movie follows faithfully the tried and tested method that brought huge success to the original, meaning that anyone who enjoyed the first movie should find this equally entertaining. Despite the obvious similarities between the two movies, there are a couple of important additions that differentiate them and should satisfy any skeptic viewers. First and foremost, this time around the action is transferred to New York, an ideal setting for a Christmas adventure. Secondly, the new members of the cast provide us with some memorable performances, the greatest of them being Tim Curry - honourable mention to Eddie Bracken's touching portrayal of Mr. Duncan."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),Girlfriend keeps pausing the film,"Watched this from 8pm with my girlfriend, currently 11pm and we're only 50 minutes into the film due to numerous trust exercises. She finds the boy really funny, and laughed when the robbers fell over on the pearls. She keeps giggling and pausing the film, talking about every scene asif she had created all the jokes herself. She is now eating left over Chinese and looks very happy with herself. Every character from the Angels with even filthier souls film has been googled to see which years the characters we're born, apparently its crazy that humans we're born in the 1800's, & most of them are being described as cute. She has just asked me what rating the film is, guessing it is a 12+, could anyone confirm this for me please?"
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),Great Movie,"REDUX (12/29/2023)
Rating: 9.2
Overall, my favorite Christmas movie as this sequel builds on the iconic elements from the first movie, in a borderline satirical way, to show how Kevin can still outsmart the Sticky Bandits on an even larger scale. Great Direction (the direction on a macroscale is grander this time around as there is a higher production budget and the movie makes an effort to show how large New York is in comparison to Kevin; the direction microscale is pretty generic to 80s family comedies; the direction of actors is great as he can bring out the humor and joy in many moments, helps set the lighthearted tone that Kevin brings throughout the movie; storytelling is very similar to other John Hughes movies), Good Acting (Great from Macaulay Culkin (Continues to bring the youthful charm the movie is known for, Great from Joe Pesci (Continues to bring the comedic charm the movie is known for), Very Good from Daniel Stern (Continues to be the good comedic relief partner that plays off of Joe Pesci), Good to Very Good from Tim Curry, Good to Very Good from Catherine O'Hara, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (The concept is very satirical because the movie makes an effort to show that the story is the same one as the first (just grander); the plot structure follows the same plot structure as the first movie; flow between sequences is like the first in that its the standard John Hughes movie; character writing was very similar to the first movie as it replicates what the characters are going through this time around), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty simple as its a family movie (but it is filled with iconic lines), the movie also uses dialogue to show how this movie is the same as the first; the humor was very good and iconic (also pokes fun at how this is the same movie as the first); the foreshadowing is good as it helps with showing the message of Kevin nothing being afraid), Great Score (Continues one of John Williams's most iconic scores), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Visual Effects (), Good Production Design (Makes an effort to show how grand and regal all the places Kevin stays at in NYC), Pacing was great as it was a steady pace that used its runtime very nicely, Build to the climax was great as it helped tie loose ends in Kevin's fears of being alone and with the old man; the climax is the most iconic part of the movie as it shows Kevin against the Sticky Bandits as he lays the house out with traps to defend himself and show how he is not afraid anymore, Tone was very similar to other John Hughes movies (mixed with Christmas elements), This movie has more of a nostalgic factor for me because I watched it more as a child ORIGINAL (01/05/2020)
Rating: 9.0
Great Acting By Culkin and Pesci, Very Funny, Iconic, Very Fun Movie to watch, Great Score, Great Screenplay, Great Story, Great Sequel."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),Hot Take (maybe not that hot): Home Alone 2 > Home Alone,"The two movies are incredibly similar (almost copy + paste), but I think that Home Alone 2 is the stronger of the two. While there was a chaotic energy when Kevin was left home alone, everything is elevated when he is alone in New York. The Plaza Hotel, Duncan's Toy Chest, the taxi ride over the Manhattan Bridge, standing atop the World Trade Center, the list goes on and on about Kevin's adventure in this film. While you have to suspend belief at the convenience of Harry & Marv running into Kevin again, their beatdown is absolutely marvelous. The thumping that Kevin gives to Marv specifically is legendary. The amount of brain damage or near death experiences given to that man in this film is too much to count. The pigeon lady is a bit rough around the edges, but the turtle love moment gives me the feels. The hotel staff, led by Tim Curry, is ridiculous and makes for some fantastic moments. At the end of the day, this movie is one of my favorite Christmas flicks of all time. Best Character: Marv
Best Quote: ""Merry Christmas, you filthy animal."" - Johnny
Best Scene: Running in the Plaza and grabbing cookies from the minibar. Best Piece of Score: ""Finale""
Song: ""All Alone on Christmas"""
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),Little physcopath,"They really said ""oh you liked the silly, funny, childish tricks from the first movie?"" And then made Kevin McAllister throw so many godamn bricks at these guys that I felt bad for the ROBBERS who were trying to steal CHARITY MONEY for KIDS IN NEED from a beloved TOY STORE. The robbers deserve financial compensation- there's something a little sick and twisted about the torture this time around, bricks, paint cans, electrical torture, fire. Is it really a happy ending if it doesn't end with Kevin, in a straight jacket, living in a facility for the mentally disturbed? I'm dubious. (Spoilers!!!!)"
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),Classic,"What can I say about this classic. I must of watched this about 100 times altogether - it's an absolutely incredible film that never gets boring. This time Kevin gets on the wrong plane and ends up near your whereas the rest of his family get on the plane to Florida. We see Kevin explore New York on his own, checking in to the hotel on his own and enjoying himself to start with. He ends up bumping into the sticky bandits and that's where it really starts. I just love the way Kevin comes up with all the traps, it's just really fun to watch. I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone. The BEST Christmas film!!"
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),It's a big ole city,"I probably prefer this film to the first film, and I think it's only heightened by the fact that this was set in New York, and the atmosphere of New York City is completely palpable. Since I can remember I've been totally enamoured with the appearance of lights in the dead of night, and their is a lot of those shots in this film, which I wholeheartedly appreciate. The clout that came from the first Home Alone, means that they production got to film in so many fantastic New York locations, like the Carnegie Hall and Rockafella Center. Kevin McCallister has always struck me as an incredibly clever kid, he is portrayed by the talented Macaulay Culkin, and he manages to showcase the smart as a whip personality without coming across as an arrogant. He also seems to have a magnetic charm that simply captures the affection to both children and adults alike. The aspect of the turtle doves was a nice inclusion, to be able to show to the audience the selfless nature of Kevin through his actions. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return to their roles as the thieves, and once again you have Joe Pesci playing the straight man, his styling of comedy in this film is brilliant to watch as he looks down upon Kevin with utter disdain. Not so much the feeling a sequel."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),The Only Decent Sequel,"We can criticize Home Alone for so many reboots that feel no charm to the original, but I can say that this is the only decent sequel. Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is the only sequel that feels faithful to the original and pretty enjoyable. Yeah, it does have the same plot of the first film with the same gimmicks. But it does bring out charm from the predecessor with and some clever and entertaining traps for the final act, great shots that gives a presentation of a New York City, characters that still have memorable personalities, and some new perspective of Kevin learning responsibility. I know fans of the first movie will probably like this. But keep in mind that again, this is going to be the same plot. So I will just give you a heads up on that if you're ever going to watch it. None of the sequels like this one will top the original, but at least this is the only one I can take compare to all the other stupid sequels/reboots that are made."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),"Lazy, but it's still good like the first","I really don't want to like this movie. It's possibly the laziest sequel in history. The messaging, the story progression, the B plots, the jokes and when they come, even some of the traps are all the exact same as the first or slightly altered. Macaulay kulkin also phones it in, in this movie his acting is so monotone. And yet despite all of this I'd say it's just as good as the first possibly better. Yes it's just the same thing done again and yes the acting isn't as good, but the new traps are so much better in this film and for what it's worth the repeated jokes are actually kinda funnier. I really don't want to like this movie for how lazy it is, but it's hard to not say this at the very least isn't as good as the first because the first one was so well done and this is the exact same with a different coat."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),Entertaining but lackluster,"The plot was very simple in idea, and the jokes were very simple except for the occasional funny reference or quip. Like the very mission-impossible-esque music that plays during infiltration of the farm/factory. Decent moments of suspense and suprise. However, there were many times when events in the plot could have been avoided through more logical actions. There were times when the voicing didn't match up with the mouth movements which could make it awkward to follow at times, by they were rare. However, the castings were exceptional at matching the characters, which aided in immersion. Additionally, the namings of the characters were subtle but funny. Such as, Mr Fry, who leads the chicken farm. This film is evidently aimed towards children, but doesn't have much for adults or even teenage audiences. Cliché heavy movie that is fun, but in a basic way. The original didn't leave much room for a sequel, but it wasn't handled well."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),Terrible effort. Why?,"Apparently this film's creators didn't bring back certain key actors from the original film for fear of controversial pasts and ""old"" sounding voices. If that's true, and despite whether it would've hurt or not, they worried about the wrong thing. The creators should've been more concerned with the subpar writing and directing that makes this film unwatchable a 2nd time and keeps it out of my Aardman collection. I give the animation and cinematography at least a 9 out of 10. Visually, it meets expectation. I give the story concept and voice acting at least a 7. It's sort of a typical tale of a teen rebelling against parent wishes, but at least told in a worthwhile way, and stays consistent with the action and characters to the end. The replacement voice actors do a decent job, imo. They're not as good and sometimes go through the motions (even the return actors), but they sound similar enough and don't botch it. From those angles, this wouldn't be a bad sequel. However, everything else is well below standard for Aardman. It lacks wit, heart, originality and personality. Most jokes are straightforward, flat, overtly juvenile and overdone at times. Some of the music, additional voices and sounds do not flow. They sound cheaply done and formulaic. It's as if the film's creators had no sense of what made people like the original film or any of the Wallace & Gromit catalogue. As if they expected to have an entirely new, unaware audience to depend on. One that didn't need to see the first film and is made up of easily-impressed 10 year-olds or moms whose film appreciation runs entirely through a kid-only, G-rated filter. There's nothing wrong with G-rated, but this effort abandoned every adult fan with a sense of humor, who appreciates subtlety and creativity - the way Aardman used to ""craft"" a film. I literally only laughed at one brief scene. I rewound it a couple times because it was reminiscent of the original film. The scene involves Rocky suggesting a rescue plan that lacks plan, then Bunty and Mac give him grief over it. Mac makes a hilarious analogy which is made even funnier by her Scottish brogue. I also thought ""Reginald"" was a redeeming character and played reasonably well by Peter Serafinowicz. But that was it. Nothing else stood out about this film other than how much it didn't stand out. Like someone else noted, I wanted to like this. I knew 20 minutes into that it was not going to be ""great"" but I watched to the end with hopes that it would at least finish ""good."" However, it is only just ""okay"" on a good day. To me, if you're going to make this effort 23 years later, why not make a proper effort? I'm also baffled by how many reviewers ""understand"" why Gibson wasn't recalled. He had a degree of detractors even when he did the original film. He's still a viable and good actor today, and has been churning out films the past 3-4 years, including six in 2022. Most are rubbish, but he had a few good films and spectacular performances in the past decade."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),Where is the soul!!,"I watched this after having loved the original as a kid (Aardman is a favourite studio of mine). I watched in anticipation for that quirky humour, snappy and action-packed sequences and was met with ... flat and cliche jokes?? It definitely felt like it had the appearance of Aardman but like it had been shucked and shelled by an American company. Left soulless and with dumbed down to the point that it was painful. Jokes now were either too simple or soft or safe, or too over-explained. Aardman is so well known for underplaying a joke or bit and then moving right on. The music also seemed less iconic to me, the themes didn't really hit hard enough and I can't even remember what music they used now ... I read later that Nick Park was not a part of the movie and this combined with the replacement of the two main characters' voice actors really just soured the whole film for me. The daughter in this film also doesn't feel fleshed out enough, but just a carbon copy of her mum. Rocky has become so dumb and is a completely different character. Ginger's voice just lacked that unique tone that the original voice actor had too. The Incredibles setting of the factory was quite funny, and I did like the eye pad reference - that was probably the closest to Aardman's original humour - but apart from that I had to force myself to sit thru the rest just in a delusional hope that it would get better. It didn't ... that last scene was so cringe and added nothing to the movie. I'm hoping that Aardman will return to their roots - this is the weakest release so far. Netflix and streaming companies need to let studios do their thing, they know how to do it best!"
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),"Whatever's past ""pleasantly surprised""","Read a few negative reviews before giving this a try and was certainly expecting the worst. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement - phenomenal follow up after all these years! I'll address the immediate elephant in the room with this movie - the original was obviously a play on The Great Escape, while the sequel is not a satire of any previous movie/story to my knowledge. I think that's a bit of a miss, but knowing that before hand hopefully sets expectations. Outside of no longer being a unique satire, the movie itself is about as enjoyable as it gets. Is the plot groundbreaking? No. Are there some plot holes and maybe a bit of head scratching over the general concept? Sure. But...they're stop motion chickens. If you're hyper-fixated on plot, I doubt you're watching. What I had to admit to within about 15 minutes is the joke writing is *better* than the original. Chicken Run is a delightful satire with a great storyline, but watching as an adult shocked me a bit due to the lack of actually funny dialogue. This sequel is absolutely full of them though, at times having non stop one-liners and puns with Arrested Development-like pacing. End of the day, this is just a phenomenally enjoyable movie. I think they could have developed a slightly more interesting/cohesive plot, but the lines and animation is so fun, who honestly cares. Great fun and will undoubtably be a great rewatch for years, just like the original."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),A sequel we didn't need,Chicken run released 23 years ago and most were happy with the ending of the film but they decided to make another one. The clay models are still amazing and run very smoothly like the first film. This one is very colourful compared to the first which uses the colours black and white. The storyline of this film is not as good as the first one in my opinion but is still creative at least. The negatives of this film is some of the characters are dumbed down like rocky is very stupid. Also they got rid of some of the original voice actors because they were (too old) when there voices are mainly the same. Overall this unwanted sequel is still pretty good but not close to the original and that is why chicken run dawn of the nugget is a. 6/10 = good family film.
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),Not a bad film. Could have been much better.,"Dawn of the Nugget was quite a good film, it does not live up to the original (but then what sequel does) It was a good story, the idea that they had built a better chicken farm as though going from the experience from Tweedys farm. The heightened security was particularly funny thinking back to the breakout attempts of the original film. And moderising the food items produced - chicken nuggets instead of chicken pie - was a good move given the worlds fast food culture. It is a shame Mr Tweedy did not make anappearance, even if it has only been a minor role it would've been good to see the character again. The ending was very much what I had hoped, going to other films to free chickens, and possibly opens the door to a further sequel. I do not think it was necessary having so much CGI, the original film was classic Aardman and I do not see anything wrong with staying true to that? They kept several of the original voice actors (Babs, Mac, Bunty and Mrs Tweedy) but I cannot say I agreed with the choice of changing actors for Ginger, Rocky, Fowler or the rats. The voices just sdidn't seem to fit the characters (particularly in Fowlers case)
The rats also were quite a funny duo in the original film, but in this one I thought they just didn't work well together."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),An Eggcellent sequel.,I saw the my first Chicken Run movie way back in 2000. Now 23 years later I'm seeing this excellent sequel that picks off from the first. The first film had Mel Gibson's voice acting talent as Rocky The Rooster. Here sadly he is missed. I thought he aught to reprise his role one last time... Zachary Levi(Shazam! 2019) takes over the role of Rocky. He does a decent job however Mel Gibson was way more experienced and versatile as an actor. We also see Thandiwe Newton(The Pursuit of Happyness 2006) take over the role of Ginger the chicken from the original actress Julia Sawalha(Absolutely Fabulous TV Sitcom). The plot of the animated film concerns the birth of Rocky and Ginger's daughter Molly and a new chicken nugget processing factory that opens up in the vicinity of the little island sanctuary they live on. Verdict: excellent and also worth watching again. Excellent tongue-in-cheek humor and superb direction and background music. The characterization was also well done as well as the script. Hopefully this concludes the Chicken Run movies.
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),"Good, But Not Great","I was waiting on this for a long time, as I was a kid when the first one come out, it was a bit of nostalgia, I seen bits of the trailer here and there and didn't want to spoil it for myself, but it was good, it wasn't as great as I thought it would be, jokes didn't land, there was a lot of lingering about, the first one is most definitely better, so much more could have been done with this, and the storyline, it wasn't bad as I said, but it wasn't what I'd hoped for, I'm not sure if there will be another one, maybe they can learn my their mistakes next time, but it was a little adventure and took me back to childhood."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),Quickly wears thin,"I admit to having a soft spot for the original CHICKEN RUN. It's a family favourite around these parts, and one which holds up to repeat viewing today. This sequel, made without the involvement of Nick Park, feels like a cheap Hollywood cash-in and can't be mentioned in the same breath. The absence of Park and the ludicrous recasting of Julia Sawalha in particular didn't bode well for it, and Newton and Levi are both as bland as you'd expect. Where this really falls apart, though, is in the shallowness of the plot. It's one of those sequels where everything's bigger and fancier, but the humour falls flat and the non-stop action soon wears thin."
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023),An amazing movie,"Watched this on Netflix and oh my I was surprised. The voice actors were great. The ideas of the movie were amazing. Lots of moments to laugh. The actors were unstoppable. I absolutely, ABSOLUTELY loved this movie. I've watched it five times now. FIVE TIMES. I'm addicted now. If you loved the first chicken run, you will live this. The only difference is that chicken run 1 was made my Dream Works and chicken run 2 was made by Netflix. I live this. Mrs Tweedy comes back after being exploded by a chicken pie machine. Mrs Tweedy has come back for her revenge. They should make another movie! Overall, it is a good movie."
The Polar Express (2004),A Roller Coaster of Christmas Cheer!,"This movie is so phenomenally well done. This movie starts off introducing a young boy who has some serious doubt about the existence of Santa Clause. He can't sleep and hears the loud of horn coming from none other than the ""Polar Express."" He is then Introduced to come aboard from the conductor, played by Tom Hanks, to visit the North Pole, throughout the journey the boy meets new friends, has hot coaco, loses a girls ticket, and meets a hobo, also played by Tom Hanks. It's so fun to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat as they make thier way to the North Pole, but what is so magical is what makes you start believing in the spirit of Christmas when they get to their destination. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as my family and I certainly have each year. Thanks for reading #schroyerfamilydaily #schroyerfamily #arrenschroyer #christmas #thepolarexpress #tomhanks #spiritofchristmas."
The Polar Express (2004),Horrible Animation,"The Polar Express was a horrible movie. I watched it thinking it was going to be a really good movie, but instead I was unfortunatly wrong. It was interesting, but the animation was creepy and terrible. It just looked too real. Don't get me wrong, thsi movie has a great message, but to me the yucky animation made it less enjoyable. If this movie had better animation or if it was live action, then it would actually be a really good watch. Sadly for me that has never happened and it will neved happen. This is just a very bad and upsetting movie over all. This is a bad movie and I don't recommend it too anyone. In all, I give this movie a 1.5 out of 10."
The Polar Express (2004),A sublime Christmas classic!,"Merry Christmas, everybody! My older brother and I have a little Christmas tradition, in which before going to bed on Christmas Eve, we watch the beloved animated Christmas film, The Polar Express. In fact, my brother still remembers when we first saw it on TV in our hotel room on a trip to Barcelona, back in Spring 2005 (when I was barely 2, and he was 5). And it still holds up nineteen years later! Based on Chris Van Allsburg's 1985 children's picture book of the same name, The Polar Express takes place at Christmas sometime in the 1950's, and centers on a young boy, simply known as the Hero Boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, movements by Tom Hanks), who does not believe in Santa Claus. However, on Christmas Eve, he takes an amazing train trip to the North Pole, along with many other kids, and sets out on a journey of self-discovery, where he soon learns that the mysteries and wonders of life never fade for those who truly believe. In other words, it puts a strong new twist on the meaning of Christmas spirit by representing it as a test of faith. And director, producer and co-screenwriter Robert Zemeckis did a flawless job of adapting the book faithfully, and he also expanded the universe to make it into a feature-length film, by adding new situations and characters; namely a girl known as the Hero Girl (speaking voice and movements by Nona Gaye, singing voice by Meagan Moore), a lonely boy named Billy (speaking voice by Jimmy Bennett, singing voice by Matthew Hall, movements by Peter Scolari), a nerdy boy known as the Know-it-all Kid (Eddie Deezen), and the disappearing hobo (Tom Hanks). The animation is extraordinary! This was the first movie ever to entirely use motion-capture animation, and it's aged like wine. Zemeckis managed to flawlessly implement the designs from Van Allsburg's illustrations into the models, and the faces of the Hero Boy and all the other kids in the movie, even the Hero Boy's little sister Sarah (voiced by Isabella Peregrina, movements by Leslie Zemeckis) still look exactly right for their age. You really can't tell that their movements were done by adults! The color scheme and sceneries, likewise, are downright gorgeous, and Zemeckis's dynamic camera moves and editing just add to it. The only problem is that sometimes, the characters' eyes look a little dead, resulting in some mild creepiness. But when it comes to mo-cap animation, I've definitely seen worse (Mars Needs Moms, anyone?). And all of the characters are excellently developed! The Hero Boy is a very engaging and compelling protagonist. The Hero Girl, likewise, is very sweet, kind, and resourceful. Billy is also very trusting and well-developed. As for the Know-it-all Kid, though he's meant to be annoying and does come off that way at times, he's also super quotable and funny. But the Conductor (Tom Hanks) is my favorite character in the movie! He's very businesslike, and gets some of the best lines. The train's crew, Smokey and Steamer (both Michael Jeter, in his final performance before his death) are great comic relief characters (especially when Steamer breaks the throttle!). And the hobo is very helpful at times. The voice-acting is amazing! Daryl Sabara supplies a certain earnestness as the Hero Boy. As the Hero Girl, Nona Gaye demonstrates that even at 30, she has the range to play a 12-year-old girl. Eddie Deezen is fittingly nerdy as the Know-it-all Kid. Jimmy Bennett retains that classic child's innocence as Billy. But in this movie, Tom Hanks really gets to show off his fabulous vocal range! While flawlessly using his natural voice as the Conductor and as the Hero Boy's adult narration, he gives a good, gravelly voice to the hobo, and a big, deep dignified voice to Santa. Before wrapping things up, let me talk about the music. Zemeckis regular Alan Silvestri, also the genius behind the scores for Lilo and Stitch and Night at the Museum, delivered a beautiful, Christmassy score for this movie! And the original Christmas songs that he co-wrote with Glen Ballard are fabulous. ""Hot Chocolate"" is a very fun song that my brother and I like to sing along to, and so is the title song. In regards to the slower songs, ""When Christmas Comes to Town"", sung by Billy and the Hero Girl, is chillingly beautiful, and the same can be said for ""Believe"" in the end credits. While I rarely think highly of Josh Groban, the way he sings ""Believe"" just makes it a better song than it normally would be. The movie also fabulously chooses really good 40s/50s-era recordings of classic Christmas songs, including ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" by Frank Sinatra. All in all, The Polar Express is a sublime Christmas classic for several reasons. The animation is innovative and beautiful, the characters are marvelous, the music is wonderful, the script is excellent, the pacing is perfect, and it stays fully faithful to Van Allsburg's work. As such, it's a fabulous movie, and a compulsory viewing for Christmas. Oh, by the way... ""WHO IN THE BLAZES APPLIED THAT EMERGENCY BRAKE?!?!?!?!?!?!"""
The Polar Express (2004),Tom hanks express,"This is not one of the better Christmas movies but it holds a special place in my heart and u watch it every Christmas eve. I never realised how uncanny the animation is in this movie. Its so poor and unsmooth that it is kind of off-putting for a lot of the movie. Tom hanks plays half the characters in this movie as well which is a bit weird. A lot of the characters are really Annoying as well, not just the know it all kid. Also I know this happens in a lot of Christmas movies but I'll take this one. If the adults don't believe in santa then where do the presents come from? Cause they aren't putting them there. It's always really annoyed me. 8/10."
The Polar Express (2004),Great family movie!,"Every year this movie becomes a tradition for me and my family, every christmas eve it's played. While there is sound arguments made about it's dated cg and many other aspects of this movie, I believe it's a great well rounded and contained movie, easy to follow story line, the pay off at the end is great and it's really is just chalk full of the christmas spirit and what christmas is. With its kid friendly story but overarching idea of the ""forgetting of christmas spirit"" i believe makes it able to resonate well with the parents watching this movie as well. This movie needs to become a contender for a holiday classic and a must watch."
The Polar Express (2004),Painfully overrated holiday staple,"I'll bury the lede a bit. I went to Catholic school from kindergarten through senior year of high school. I attended school in the 2000s, so I'm old enough to remember when teachers would wheel in TVs on carts when we'd watch a movie. I also remember that 99.9% of the movies we watched were fluffy and generic, usually kids and bunnies going on adventures or some such nonsense, usually animated and produced by D-class studios. The image of *everyone* in my 8th grade art class falling asleep during -insert movie title here- is etched vividly into my memory. The Polar Express is one of those movies, just with a Hollywood level budget. This was the go-to for wearing your pajamas to school the day before Christmas break, gathering in the hallway, sitting on the floor and sipping hot chocolate. That's all this film is good for. It's a flaccid male appendage in cinematic form. The nameless child characters are nauseatingly opaque, especially the know-it-all voiced by Mandark, the obvious token girl and Billy. The latter two are presented as sweepingly virtuous, but really serve no purpose other than to glorify the materialistic and hyper-capitalistic tendencies of contemporary Christmastime. ""When Christmas Comes To Town"" has to be the closest thing to nails on a chalkboard ever put to song. This is the kind of film you put on to distract a child and absolve yourself of being present with them in the moment, irrespective of what role you play in their life (parent, teacher, etc). I truly don't understand why this became a holiday staple."
The Polar Express (2004),Leaves you feeling cold and sort of empty,"I watched this for the first time this week and it's a film that sticks with you in an uncomfortable sort of way. I get it that these special effects were ""cutting edge"" at the time and yet, seeing how much further the technology has come with films like the Avatar franchise, this one just has a weird, unreality to it, like they hadn't quite figured it out, leaving us to watch these characters that are animated yet soulless mannequins, like something reanimated in a Lovecraftian fiction. Faces don't seem to move right, eyes don't quite track, mouths don't seem to be completely expressive. This is truly the ""uncanny valley"" on display and you never really get used to it, like these abominations could turn at any moment, spring out of the television and chase you down the street. Adding to the creepiness is that they take these inhuman characters and put them into a frigid environment of endless snow and frozen lakes, but where strangely no one ever gets cold (except for the viewer) . Perhaps these bizarre, lifeless creations are impervious to the effects of the cold? Who knows. Probably the single most troubling part of the film to me was when the three primary characters are lost wandering around the claustrophobic North Pole city, devoid of anyone except for the eerie reverb of old Christmas music echoing through the streets. Lights in windows don't reveal a warm home of elf families eating dinner or anything but rather show only abandoned record players. What sort of nightmarish landscape is this? I will give mention to the music, as Alan Silvestri did a nice job with the score and incorporating old familiar melodies, although I was left puzzled with the primary leitmotif that sounded weirdly similar to the Buddy the Elf motif from Elf (2003) a year earlier. Listen to those first 4 notes and compare them and see if you hear it as well."
The Polar Express (2004),One of my favorite Christmas movies,"From director Robert Zemeckis, comes an amazing magical Christmas adventure. Based on one of the best selling Christmas book of the same name, ""The Polar Express"" tells the story about a boy who is curious about Santa Claus' existence boarding a magical train heading to the North Pole. Along the way, the makes friends with a girl, a know-it all, and a lonely boy named Billy. What I like about this movie is how the characters and movie scenes replicates the illustrations of Chris Van Allsburg's book. I even like the scenes where the kids are served hot chocolate, the Hobo and the boy skiing on the roof, the train going down glacier gulch, the wide observation car ride, the ride in Santa's sack, and Santa giving out the first gift of Christmas. This movie is one of the best Christmas movies and it is fun to watch it as a family, and see it in theaters when it is rereleased."
The Polar Express (2004),The Dead Eye Express,"If I boarded this train I'd purposely loose my ticket in hopes of actually being thrown off... Yes this film is nearly 20 years old and has become a favourite among the classic Christmas films but why I don't no ? If it's anything it's a Tom Hank's fever dream...the dudes literally everywhere ! He's the train conductor, the hobo ghost man, the main boy and even Santa ! It's like a bad trip ! And I love Tom Hanks. Oh and the eyes...omg the eyes of all the children are so lifeless, their expressions blank and emotionless! I know the animation was deemed groundbreaking at the time but it's awful and somewhat unpleasant to watch because of how jarring they look. Stuff of nightmares not Christmas cheer ! Also why are they all voiced by adults - especially the annoying 'know it all' kid ! I mean seriously what child sounds like that ? Such a bizarre film."
The Polar Express (2004),A great film that deserves much more recognition than it receives.,"This film is one of those movies that has to be seen to be believed. No pun intended. This film may not be a masterpiece by any stretch of the word, but it is by far a film that deserves its flowers much more, in ways many viewers wouldn't even recognize. Firstly, congratulations to Sho Igarashi, the Cloth and Hair Supervisor, and the team of clothing animators, for making clothing that is animated realistically in 2004. They did an amazing job, and I give a round of applause. Secondly, the Sound Crew, Skywalker Studios, needs a round of applause for the unbelievably-good usage of foley and sound effect work. Everything from the train wheels on ice to the heart-beats and ringing bells sound absolutely beautiful. And, of course, a big hand to the incomparable Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri, who knocked the soundtrack composition work out of the park as always. Thirdly, give the choreographers and MOCAP dancers some water and a raise. The ""Hot Chocolate"" scene was done live in a recording studio for the motion-capture, and I can only imagine the sheer number of takes a dance that intricate would require to pull off successfully. Also, Tom Hanks singing is a national treasure. Fourthly, the coordinators at the Steam Locomotion Institute deserve all the love in the world for the impeccable work on the inner workings of steam locomotives being almost spot-on for this film. (Aside from the flux capacitor, but that was normal for Robert Zemeckis.) And finally, a round of applause to everyone behind the scenes, including the likes of set decorator Karen O'Hara, second-unit director Steven Starkey, and, of course, all of the set designers, welders, foremen, concept artists, and tech workers who had to come together to bring the spirit of Christmas to our screens. From the Looney Submarine to all of you, Thank You. And Happy Holidays."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),"""Don't get lost in this garden; you'll never be able to find your way out""","This is a line spoken as the characters briefly walk through a garden, never to mention or return to it again. The film is filled with 100s of these 'Chekhov Guns' that are never fired, instead existing simply as attempts to world-build. But since these little details are never followed up on or made coherent with the rest of the story or even seem to contribute to an overarching theme, the story starts to feel convoluted and uninteresting. The animation itself is beautiful, and of course that's what you expect from Studio Ghibli. The actors and music was nice too, but that's not enough to carry an entire film."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Ephemeral Wings: A Ghibli-Inspired Odyssey in 'Boy and the Heron',"10 out of 10: 'Boy and the Heron' is a cinematic masterpiece directed by Hayao Miyazaki, showcasing a profound love for the Ghibli legacy. The film seamlessly weaves a captivating narrative, reminiscent of Ghibli's magic, with breathtaking animation and a heartfelt connection to nature. A must-watch for every Ghibli enthusiast, as it pays homage to the studio's timeless charm while adding a unique touch of its own. 'Ephemeral Wings' invites audiences on an enchanting journey, where the delicate balance between humanity and nature unfolds in a visual symphony, leaving a lasting impression on the soul."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),A more than worthy last big film for Miyazaki,"For me it's a 8.5-9/10. When I watched the teaser I was expecting a movie that's a lot darker and serious like Grave of the Fireflies. But they did a good job balancing comic relief and the serious main plot about acceptance of the death of his mother and the role of his new stepmother in his life. They managed to do this mix in very beautiful metaphors, and a couple of allusions to other movies. Visually stunning. The whole movie was produced so well, and it would make a perfect last long movie for Miyazaki as it brings a lot of things together. I am expecting at least one more short film by him though hopefully."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Magnificent and deeply personal,"Who knows if Miyazaki will ever retire 'for real,' but this is the closest to farewell I've seen from him. It felt like the best goodbye: timed perfectly, achingly beautiful, haunting, and genuine. The artwork is, of course, masterful. Many of the landscapes took my breath away completely. The character design is classic Ghibli (very aligned with Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle) and weird in the best of ways. The film was more suspenseful than I expected from the description, which was a fun surprise. But the real delight of this film is in how deeply personal it is. I felt like I was seeing something private, like a pouring out of Miyazaki's soul. It was a surreal synthesis of the best of Ghibli and the fears of an artist with boundless imagination and a vulnerable inner child. The film wrestles with issues of war and human malice, belonging and sense of place, escapism versus reality, temporal relationships, and grief. I will need to watch it about 10 more times to catch even a fraction of the symbolism, but it's such a moving tale that I'm looking forward to that hunt for its meaning."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Something more than just learning about grief,"I have made some reflections about this movie, which I loved. I must say, I did watch few analysis about it but was not entirely satisfied with those reviews. As a matter of fact, most of the people focused on the journey of grief, which I agree is the core of the film, but not the only meaning that is overall conveyed. I hope someone agrees with my ideas and/or has thought the same. Firstly, as in every other Miyazaki movie, there is a lot of concern about Mother Earth. Especially when we move to the other world, we take a peek at the constant respect we must show to other creatures, both those we understand, and those we don't understand, such as the Pelicans. They were inserted in an environment where they were forced to eat the Wara Wara (Pelicans are known for swallowing everything there is to eat, so the choice of the animal, I believe, is no coincidence). The scene where Mahito buries the pelican is incredibly beautiful. Secondly, the Wara Wara become human beings once they ""float to the surface"". As Kiriko says ""It has been a long time since they've done that: we have finally given them the necessary nutrients"". I hope that in this case the metaphor is that of giving our children a world where they can actually live in (the necessary nutrients), so they can build a sustainable future (a long time since that happened). Thirdly, life, death and all it comes with it. Grief in all its nuances is shown in this lyrical journey. What I liked was that Mahito was able to meet his mother in a different stage of her life, and therefore remembered her in a new and beautiful way. This enables him to accept his new mother, that has become increasingly fundamental throughout his adventure in the unknown. Moreover, the ""magical amulets"" are the old ladies looking over him. While he is in another world, those that are protecting him are people that care for him, in particular old people (in Japan the culture of respect for the elderly is much stronger compared to the rest of the world). This again is a message for us and the fact that the bonds created during our lives can overcome everything, moving across time and space. Fourthly, the balance of all our worlds is on a thin line, and we, just like Mahito, are responsible for it. The equilibrium between the blocks, mirrors the precarious state in which we constantly live in. The next wrong step and we risk of losing it. Lastly I thought of a couple of things which might be correct but also not, so I wouldn't take it for granted. The parrots to survive the fall of their world, are forced to enter the one where Mahito lives in. By doing this they become ""standard"" parrots, maybe suggesting the case of immigrants obliged to adapt to a society that is entirely different than theirs. The friendship between the Heron and the boy, which starts as a relationship where they are enemies and keep hurting each other, up to becoming friends and healing each other. As the Heron suggests, ""only the person that hurt my beak can put it back in place"". I've taken up this analysis without considering the artistic journey of director Miyazaki. As most say, this is probably his most profound movie, that takes up his relationship with reality and fantasy and the unity that should be maintained within it. In conclusion, the movie is beautiful, and maybe after a rewatch I will understand even better. It is both difficult and easy to see all the things that hide behind symbols and I tried my best."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),"Lost, Grief and Legacy",The Boy and the Heron is what is considered the final work or legendary director Hayao Miyazaki and it has all the things you would expect for his final outing. The film is set during the second world war in japan from the perspective of a young boy. The boy suffers a devastating lost in the beginning and the movie goes through the stages of grief he experiences while being tormented by a strange heron. The movie starts become interesting when the boy goes on a journey through time and space. He meets new characters and challenges that helped him deal with the loss he has. The movie has many references to Miyazaki's previous work and has his style of pacing and storytelling. In some way close to the end of the movie he acknowledges that it is time to move on and let someone else take over from him.
The Boy and the Heron (2023),An engrossing and puzzling journey that will stick in your mind,"""Princess Mononoke"" is the only other Miyazaki film that I've seen (which is clearly my loss). Just saw The Boy and the Heron in its subtitled (not dubbed) English version at one of our local independent cinemas, and it's quite an experience. To say the least, Miyazaki has an inventive mind. The overarching theme of the story is that young Mahito embarks on a journey to meet (or save?) his mother, thought by everyone to have died in a fire the year before. But that summary conveys almost nothing of what happens on screen. We are step by step taken into an increasingly bizarre wonderland of human and non-human, good and evil characters who alternately guide Mahito, or hinder him, or push him along. He's a naive boy, but not just a cipher to whom things happen: he has a will of his own and is not afraid to assert it at critical times -- but as we see, his judgment isn't always true. There's no doubt that Miyazaki has an impressive visual imagination, which is on full display here. I was struck by the extreme use of 'masking' as an animation technique: the backgrounds, landscapes, and settings both outdoors and indoors are rendered with full, lush detail and striking colors, whereas the main characters are drawn quite simply and generically, which makes it easier for the viewers to put themselves in their place amidst the action. (The exceptions are the odd characters that we would NOT identify with, like the Grandfather or the gnome-like grannies in the country house -- those are drawn in very specific detail.) And there are genuinely arresting concepts that will stay in your mind, like the corridor of doors leading into different worlds (in this movie, the multiverse is digital, not continuous!), or the fire maiden Himi. The strongest impression I came away with, though, was that as the movie went along, I could not predict what we were going to see next: the action flows from scene to scene smoothly enough, but with big and sometimes jarring changes in location and sub-theme, as if they didn't want to be held to a single self-consistent storyline. Perhaps I'm just too wedded to Western linear thinking. This story is coming from a truly different place."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Excruciating we had to leave yes it's time to retire,"This was a real just chuck if all in the pot and see whats digestible. Well not much at all really, this is a red hot mess one nonsensical scene after another, no cohesive narrative it was like oh yeah lets do that next why the hell not. Tell me a single reason why we should care about anything or anyone in this film, didnt know what was going on who the females were, who the bad guys might be, or what they might have been trying to achieve. It was so irritating we stuck it out until thirty minutes from the end and couldn't stand it any more. Have seen many Ghibli films and this is very weak, anyone raving about it well...dont know what to say to you because this emperor is buck naked."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Greatest Hits,"A beautifully crafted animation full of imagination and charm. This really played out like a Miyazaki greatest hits tour. We have the usual Ghibli ingredients: a young protagonist moving to a new place, an ill or deceased parent or carer, cute little creatures, seemingly evil characters who turn out to be harmless and quite endearing. I actually enjoyed the first part a lot more than when all the action took place.. It's always nice to see a Ghibli set in Japan as well and I loved seeing the landscapes.. Honestly huge credit to the artists because there were some wild moments of animation: shadows on water, reflections in mirrors, sunrises. Don't get me wrong it isn't top tier Ghibli, it's not up there for me with an Ocean Waves, Totoro or Only Yesterday. But it's very very good. If it proves to be Miyazaki's final bow than it is a wonderful way to go out."
The Boy and the Heron (2023),Masterpiece,"Like genuine masterpiece. Symbolist and surrealist masterpiece, smart, a thinker but clear, very deep into grief psychology and then journey through it, journey through becoming self and a new self at a early age, difficult to portray and done perfectly. Music on the more conceptual side this time matching the film's emotional ride. Great mix of animation styles to show an era and slowly becomes more defined as the film goes on. Amazing design all over. So deep it's really quite a ride. Definitely a multifaceted message to the world, becoming, self and what's to come of both what we create and what he's created."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),Fun for whole family,"A really good family movie. I watched with a 5 year and a 2 years old. A lot of violence and fight scene, so that's where the youngest started to wander off. But overall fun for all. No hidden adult jokes or things that will go over children's head. It told its story fair and square. It gave good memories of many hours in front of a NES, and the 5 year before who is used to Mario kart was also full of excitement about car scenes. We watched it in Danish though, got to watch later to listen to Jack Black's Bowser. The animation itself was at times vey realistic, and very well done. No ugly Sonic here."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),A Nostalgic Joyride,"Let's be clear from the start : Super Mario Bros was crafted with one primary goal-to delight and cater to a massive community of fans. Embracing this premise, the film delivers an unabashed celebration of the iconic gaming universe that has been etched into our hearts since childhood. It's a whirlwind tour through a family of characters, a fast-paced homage to the games we've all cherished, even if the visitation is somewhat brisk. Undeniably, this isn't the film of the century, but it achieves what it sets out to do-it entertains, and it does so swiftly. The runtime breezes by, a testament to the film's intent to jog memories and evoke a sense of nostalgia in the shortest possible time. It's a delightful montage of familiar faces and game scenarios, a fond reminder of the diverse landscapes we've explored in the virtual realms. The film dabbles in every character and game we've encountered over the years, providing a rapid-fire trip down gaming history. While the speed might leave some wanting more depth, it aligns perfectly with the movie's objective: to spark joy, laughter, and wonder. Super Mario Bros' isn't aiming for profundity; it's aiming to tickle the funny bone and ignite a sense of marvel. In essence, the movie is a thank-you note to the fans, a gleeful acknowledgment of the shared joy that gaming has provided. It's a lighthearted, easily digestible experience that doesn't linger unnecessarily, ensuring that the audience leaves with a smile on their face. Thank you for bringing this anticipated film to life and for creating it with the intention to make us laugh, have fun, and be enchanted-mission accomplished."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),History Reborn.. Passion Reignited,"When I first heard about the movie, i prayed from all my heart that it won't be a disappointment that your demolish childhood memories.. And when I actually finally watched, I cannot say anything except that i am extremely satisfied... The movie has maintained the Mario theme to the maximum level.. Including the soundtracks, the usage of magical boxes.... Adding DK.. Also the entire Mashroom World is exactly how i always imagined it.. I enjoyed watching it.. And loved how the movie was meant to show how Mario was introduced to the Mashroom World and how he had to adapt to it.. Watching the movie reignited the need to replay Super Mario again.."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),Makes the original Mario movie a masterpiece,"The voice acting and script take away 7 points, impacting the overall experience. The graphics hold a certain charm, allowing us to envision Nintendo games on alternative hardware. However, animations fall short with standard, dull, and predictable sequences. Mario's character suffers from a voice mismatch and an inexplicable inability to perform platform jumps, portraying him as the weakest in the galaxy. The claim of Peach being the strongest, solely due to birth, raises eyebrows. Consider revisiting the original Mario Bros for a potentially more rewarding experience, despite its acknowledged shortcomings."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),Fun and a little nostalgic Mario movie!,"I'm late for this but I have been playing the Mario games since I was 3 or 5 and I have been waiting for a movie for a while, the live action doesn't feel real by this one does and this movie is one of the best animated movies of 2023! The way they have the lore in this is pretty good, all the power ups the rainbow road and the final battle with Mario, Luigi and bowser is perfect! The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with peaches, level complete, superstars, and more. Only issue is is that it's to fast paced and it gets old and I wanted it to be more nostalgia but it's a very good movie 9.5/10. 😁 😀"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),Good fun movie,"All in all a lot better than I expected at first. I did not expect to like this movie at all with all the bad video game movies we have had, but lately is is starting to change. Like with sonic this movies stays close to what the video games is about and does not try to stray further away from it than necessary. The fact that this movie is actually an origin story to Mario(and donkey Kong too) was unexpected but narratively it made a lot of sense. With the addition of all the little Easter eggs and really good western style animation a had a good time watching this movie. The plot on the other hand was very basic but that is not really the reason anyone would watch a movie like this( maybe some movie critics that don't really get it). The movie stayed consistent with its characters and Mario had a nice little arc for himself aswell. Anya Taylor Joy, who is one of the best actresses of this, is not the best voice actress and I think she was really bad as peach, while the others were good."
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),This made me smile,"Watching this just gave me several geek-gasms. I didn't think a movie adaptation of such a simple and innocent video game could be packed to the brim with this much nostalgia. We get mario acting like mario within the first 10 minutes of this thing, Bowser acting a little too cruel for my taste but whatever, and so much goddamn fanservice it's borderline atrocious. I'd be open to a Wario sequel, just for the record. I have to give credit to Nintendo. It takes a special brand of courage to write something that's stupid on purpose. This degree of cheesy belongs on an omelete and I am HERE FOR IT XD This movie was so much fun from start to finish it made me feel like a kid again, if only for a brief moment ^^"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),"Wow, that was disappointing","I was really looking forward to this movie. My sister and I loved the SNES games in the 90s and also had the Donkey Kong games. This was such a let down. The Mario games weren't all fighting. It was a puzzle based platformer where you had to bonk enemies in the head. What is this? It's like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. There's no humour. It was boring. Just chasing and fighting and not much fun. I don't know what else to say about it, but I've got to write more. I just want the world to know how sad and disspointed I am. I guess I'll just have to go play some old games to cheer myself up. No Yoshi :("
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),"Decent Kids Movie, Not So Great for Fans","It's a decent movie for young children, plenty of action and fun turns that'd keep most kids entertained, but for more serious fans it leaves a lot to be desired. As someone who grew up with a lot of the games and played many of the installments of the franchise with family and friends, the movie was a little disappointing. The general plot of the movie was okay, the more human background of the brothers was great, but past the introduction of the Princess it kind of falls flat. There were a handful of moments that got me excited, (the Rainbow Road scene, the Donkey Kong vs Mario scene, and the ending where Luigi and Mario team up) but there are a lot of moments where the acting and story can be a little... eh. The actors for Mario and Princess Peach weren't overall great either. The voice of Mario could have gotten away with a Brooklyn/American accent quite easily instead of the in-game italian voice, as the brothers are originally from Brooklyn, however Chris Pratt doesn't really deliver. A lot of actors in the cast fail to bring more of the character into their voice acting, leaving a lot of them to only sound like the actor/actress and not the character. Many fans had a big issue with this with Mario's voice, but it's visible in Donkey Kong and Princess Peach as well. Peach's voice actress sounds incredibly different to her in game voice, and it lacks the sweet, kind-hearted nature that Princess Peach should carry. You don't need a big celebrity name or names to make a good film. Prioritise authenticity over having a celebrity heavy cast. In the games, Princess Peach is very sweet, kind and gentle. In the movie she was changed, fitting into a more typical mould of a ""Strong Woman"" rather than adapting her in game personality. Princess Peach lacked most of her in game characteristics, and subsequently most of her character. Her personality is more akin to Princess Daisy rather than herself. Even in Super Smash Bros. Princess Peach still holds her sweetness and caringness in her voice, body language and attacks, she's still strong and tough, but she's still Princess Peach. There shouldn't be a need to change her. The best part of the movie overall was the soundtrack. The music was beautiful with an excellent combination of songs from different Mario games. The inclusion of the DK Rap was an excellent choice, and brought a lot of joy to me and my brother when we watched it. The non-Mario music were really good choices too. If Nintendo and Illumination decide to make another movie, which was hinted at at the end of the film, I'd like to see more true-to-the-character voicing and acting. The biggest downfall of this film was its inability to properly adapt the characters, which I acknowledge is hard and that the actors/actresses are doing their best, but there is plenty of room for improvement. A voice cast more similar to the one for the animated TV show would work much better than the cast that was chosen (no disrespect intended towards the actors/actresses)"
The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023),It Does What It's Meant To Do In The Best Way Possible,"They could not have made this movie any better in my opinion. It was meant to be a faithful videogame adaptation for kids, while adults still have moments like ''Oh, I recognise that from the games I used to play!''. The combination of childhood amusement and the nostalgia of adults is just perfect. The reactions in the theaters were so amazing. And yes, the story is pretty thin and not the most original, but it still is a kids movie, and this move did not have the goal to make an amazing new story, just to amuse the people watching the movie who are also familiar to the games. For me, this remains one of the best videogame adaptations yet."
Trolls Band Together (2023),If I could give zero,"If I could give zero rating to this movies. I WOULD. First of all, I liked a lot of dreamworks movies. Some of them I can watch over and over again. But I could not finish this movie in the theatre. I walked out because there are so many ridiculous jokes and too much passive aggressive information in the movie that I can't believe they put in! It supposed to be kids movie. So let the movie to be innocent. Not by adding all of those message you are trying to send out , nor those inappropriate jokes. Kids will not understand. I get it . But you know there will be no kids just walk in movie theatre by themselves. So I see how you want to pass those jokes or messages to the parents and the society. I am so disappointed by dreamworks. This company is trying to help to divided the society. You are entertainment company, bring people joy not this ! The story is boring. The music , some of them is fine. But lots of them are way too much! Too much for me as adult not even to say to the children! I wish dreamworks can do some more movies like Shrek, simple , sweet innocent movie for the kids and for the parents all together."
Trolls Band Together (2023),Good but not as good as the 1st two,"Trolls Band Together is a 2023 jukebox animated comedy featuring the voice talents of Justin Timberlake,Anna Kendrick,Kid Cudi and new cast members including
NSync,Camilla Cabello,Troye Silvan,Amy Schumer,Kenan Thompson and Daveed Diggs. Branch(Timberlake) meets a blast from his past who wants him to join Boyzone(a band that is set up by Branch's brothers). Meanwhile Poppy meets her sister Viola(Cabello) who shows up unannounced. Will this cause problems with Branch and Poppy(Kendrick). Overall it was a good film that pays tribute to the early 00s(especially having NSync who Justin Timberlake was apart of since the late 90s). The story was good too but honestly I preferred the last two films. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."
Trolls Band Together (2023),Not sure of who the audience is here,"Just saw this with my kids and we all thought it was ok. I think the one huge thing that they overlooked is that kids do not care about old boybands at all, so all of the references went over their head and the story itself was kind of forgettable. At the end, Branch out if the blue reveals that he was with a boyband other than his brothers and the *NSYNC trolls appear to sing a song. While the adults obviously got it, my kids were confused by an ending where Branch suddenly had a different band for no reason at all. If this was meant to entertain adults, the lame sexual innuendos and drug references just felt lazy and forced. It was more offensive that they think this is how we're entertained than the fact that it was in a kids movie. Just completely unnecessary. Overall, it just lacked the charm that the first one had. It didn't have a strong story and no real message other than having siblings is great if you magically have the same personality like Poppy and her conveniently new found sister. Not completely terrible, but as my kids would say, ""This is a total cash grab."""
Trolls Band Together (2023),Awwwwwsome,"I have waited so long to see this movie because I love music and great cinematography. Firstly the music was cute yet so serious. It was adorable. The cinematography was vibrant. The colours were enthralling. It was a feast for the eyes and ears. The jokes were witty and for adults too. What I love most about the trolls is that they band together and are super close, friendly and generally positive. It was a thrill picking out the voice actors from the trolls dialogue. My favourite one is Justin Timberlake. It was a sweet escape and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend to young at heart adults and children. I gave this movie 10 out of 10."
Trolls Band Together (2023),Another Banger Soundtrack,"Let me tell you something pal -- this soundtrack is a freakin banger. I took my friends to this who have no idea what the Trolls Universe was and after the film everyone was signing the songs in the car, at the restaurant, and at home. The villains were iconic, the plot was everything we needed, and Keenan Thompson's character made my friend (Leshawn) bust out laughing in the theater. It's a kids movie so I expected not all the jokes were going to land, but all of them did. The adult jokes were so funny because it was so relatable. The best part especially about this type of movie is the meta-community behind it, where from the music, to the immersive art, make sure you check it out when you can."
Trolls Band Together (2023),"simple but engaging, with enough twists and surprises to keep the audience entertained","This is Bing. I can help you write a template movie review for the film Trolls Band Together. Here is an example of how you can structure your review: --- # Trolls Band Together: A Musical Adventure with Heart and Humor Trolls Band Together is the third installment in the animated Trolls franchise, and it might be the best one yet. The film follows Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake), who are now officially a couple, as they embark on a quest to reunite Branch's long-lost brothers and rescue one of them from a pair of evil pop stars. Along the way, they encounter new friends, old enemies, and a lot of catchy songs. The film's plot is simple but engaging, with enough twists and surprises to keep the audience entertained. The themes of family, friendship, and music are explored with warmth and humor, and the film delivers a positive message about not letting anyone steal your talent or your joy. The character development is also well-done, as we see Poppy and Branch grow closer and learn more about each other's pasts, while also meeting new characters who have their own personalities and arcs. The film's overall impact is uplifting and fun, with a satisfying conclusion that celebrates the power of love and music. The director, Walt Dohrn, does a great job of creating a colorful and vibrant world for the trolls, with a distinctive style that blends 2D and 3D animation. The film is visually stunning, with a lot of attention to detail and creativity. The musical sequences are especially impressive, with a variety of genres and styles that showcase the talents of the voice cast and the original songs. The performances of the actors are also excellent, with Kendrick and Timberlake leading the way with their charm and chemistry. The supporting cast is also stellar, with notable roles by Troye Sivan, Eric André, Daveed Diggs, Kid Cudi, Amy Schumer, and Andrew Rannells. The film's strengths are its music, its humor, and its heart. The film has a great soundtrack, with songs that are catchy, funny, and emotional. The film also has a lot of jokes and references that will appeal to both kids and adults, especially those who grew up in the '90s and are familiar with boy bands and pop culture. The film also has a lot of heart, with scenes that are touching and sincere, and characters that are likable and relatable. The film's weaknesses are few and minor, such as some clichés and stereotypes, some predictable moments, and some scenes that might be too scary or sad for younger children. Overall, Trolls Band Together is a delightful and enjoyable film that will make you laugh, sing, and feel good. It is worth recommending to anyone who likes animated films, musicals, or trolls. It is a film that will make you want to band together with your loved ones and celebrate life."
Trolls Band Together (2023),"Colorful, adorable, familiar and full of music","I have always believed that animated films for children's target audience are mainly adults, since they almost always have messages that clearly reach children but not in the way they can reach an adult. This film is about family ties, about how they can be broken but later they can always heal again based on communication. It also talks about acceptance of those we see as different, how wanting power can lead to harming others. Super colorful, happy movie, perfect for these times, which maintains the essence of Trolls but with new characters, with a lot of music, makes you want to dance and sing, with many references to famous people (in the Latin American version they adapted it to regional references) and at the same time world of Hollywood and entertainment. Movie that brought NSYNS back together (despite JT's cancellation). Film that can be enjoyed by adults and children."
Trolls Band Together (2023),adorable movie,"This movie was adorable and fun to watch because the entire franchise has been great and because my sister was in love with these toys as a kid. The movie had some adult humor in it that I enjoyed as a 25 year old, reminds me of old Dreamwork's movies like Shrek. The movie in itself was well planned out and the music was fantastic. A few things in the movie I struggled with were the moral dilemma in Veneer and the scene where Viva and the golf ball trolls want to kill Bridgette. The cast list in the movie amazed me with how extensive it was from movie and tv stars like Zoey Deschanel to Kid Cudi to Anna Kendrick. The moral dilemma in Veneer was not well executed in my opinion, I would have either preferred a more direct positive change before the big concert or a immediate change at the end on the boat, not a progressive change. As for the scene where they want to kill Bridgette, I think the idea was great but the fact they didn't make the scene a bit longer, lessened the impact. The movies music was phenomenal and I will say that again and again. 3/3 on the Trolls franchise soundtracks. My favorite part: The final scene where NSYNC shows up and sings with Timberlake like they had use to sing together was iconic."
Trolls Band Together (2023),"It's really fun Moreover, the music is very exciting","Yes... the animation is fun, especially for children, the animation is colorful and adorable, I enjoyed it especially with the music which was really fun to listen to, I even sang along
My kids love watching this Trolls because cute yea ofc ...I also like the Trolls characters, especially Poppy and Branch,they sing well. For animations with a music genre, this film is the best in my opinion
As for the story, well... it's not bad, even though there is a forced story like Poppy's sister who just appears The story is too classic
I enjoyed this film more for the music and animation than the story."
Trolls Band Together (2023),N*Sync Band Together... I Wish!,"I feel like this third Troll movie should've been the second one. Cause I see it has way more connections to the first movie than the second one. Bridget and King Gristle got their love story sequel, Poppy found her long lost sister, the big reveal of Branch's past. Compared to the second movie, which has way less connection to the first movie, this one just felt more like a continuation of the first movie. I mean, the second movie didn't even include King Gristle! But that's just my honest opinion. Anyway, moving on to the review. Just like the other Trolls movies, it's full of music. Only this time, it's all about boybands. Boyzone, N*Sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, etc. You gotta be a music lover or a child to enjoy this movie. Otherwise, it'll felt like watching any other animated movie. To me personally, It would've been great if the members of Brozone were voiced by N*Sync members. Too bad... too bad..."
Klaus (2019),A Christmas classic,"I didn't grow up celebrating Christmas, but I still watched handful of Christmas movies. Mostly the 90s and early 2000s classics. I remember watching this movie back when it was first released, and felt in love with it instantly. I decided to Re-watch it, 4 yrs later and I still cried. What a lovely, charming and clever film. A lovely origin story of the wonder of klaus. I can already see myself rewatching it in the future and still crying. Esp, when the little sami girl finally got her gift. The quote, ""A true selfless act always sparks another"" will stick with me. Truly one of the best Christmas movies. 10/10."
Klaus (2019),One of my favorite movies ever,"This movie is just phenomenal. The animation is beautiful, the characters are memorable, it's weirdly dark but also extremely wholesome. I love that it also it's left vague what's magic, and what's real, allowing your imagination to take over. It's also very funny, the villains had me laughing out loud every time they were onscreen. I also love that it takes familiar stories such as the emperor's new groove, Romeo and Juliet, and Santa origin stories and make a beautiful mix into this movie. Word needs to be spread that this movie exists, the people I've showed this too were like ""how have I never seen this? It's amazing."" If you love this movie as much as I do, spread the word!"
Klaus (2019),Woooo wooo The best Christmas movie,"In 2023 I just saw the best Christmas movie for me and with excellent animation and from Netflix. This film includes animation, drama, comedy, emotion and very very emotional. It's about Jesper, the spoiled and egocentric son of the owner of the post office. He sends his son to a town on a distant island to be the town's official postman. He tells him that he has to collect 6,000 letters in a year so that he doesn't lose his inheritance (knowing that it is almost impossible since it is a town that, due to traditions and customs of yesteryear, is divided into 2 sides Ellingboe vrs Krum), in a town where the rule is to harm the other side without reason, where the children don't go to school, Jesper discovers Klaus (A widower who tried for many years to have children with his wife but they couldn't, in all those years of waiting for a child he started making wooden toys for them) , a man who had lost his way but with the arrival of Jesper he finds him (although Jasper's initial intentions were to recover his life as a millionaire), they begin a journey that takes us to all the traditions related to Santa (giving gifts at night). Chimney, good and bad children, coal for the bad ones, leaving food for Santa, writing letters to Santa, the sleigh, the reindeer, Santa's helpers, Santa's suit, gifts around the world), how you begin to know That bad children should not be given gifts, the children of this town begin to change it by doing good actions for the other side, which begins to generate a change in the town, just as they want to know how to write and read to write letters to Klaus. Which makes the school open. It shows us how they begin the tradition of gifts on December 25. In the end Jesper decides to stay in this town, he and Klaus being the ones who gave the gifts (this with the help of the foreign girl who is the one who teaches Jasper the meaning of everything he is doing) for many years, until Klaus As an old man, one day he dies or fades away, but Jasper, without understanding how, knows that gifts continue to be delivered every Christmas and knows that he can see his friend once a year. One of the best animated films of recent years with excellent animation and a beautiful official song, it covers many topics such as wars, hatred for being ""different"", social segregation - by ""races"", fertility problems, importance of education, how education can change a people, not having a clear direction, losing the sense of vocation and finding it again, friendship, family, how children are a reflection of their parents' education, how children are born without seeing social-racial differences, they only see people the same as them. The most important thing is that one sincere act always leads to another and with this we can change the world for the better."
Klaus (2019),From time to time Netflix gives us something beautiful,"From time to time Netflix gives us something beautiful: In a world of good, bad, curious, and terrifying movies, this one is beautiful. That word, said quickly but carrying a special meaning, is how I would describe this film. It allows us to see the humblest and purest origin of Klaus. It manages to make you feel warmth that wraps you on a cold night, no matter where you are. That's why it deserves a place on the list of classics we grew up with. There's nothing better than being with family, sipping hot chocolate in the morning, with no work to do or stressful things to think about, and feel like a child again."
Klaus (2019),"Ugh! Terrific animation, crappy story","So horribly formulaic, as others have said, poor character development and so epically predictable. Santa's story didn't need to be rewritten this badly. If you want a good spoiled brat turned good story with interesting villains go rent ""The Emperor's New Groove"". If you want to see decent heroics go rent ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"". The animation in this one is prettier but pretty doesn't mean better. The voice talent is decent enough, but that all. The jokes are just bad and characters do a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense unless you are a depressive type and we all know how that makes for fun entertainment!"
Klaus (2019),Cute and creative,Klaus was an enjoyable film to watch. What makes a good Christmas film is something novel and interesting. Klaus keeps you entertained and wondering how things will work out. In the back of your mind you are trying to piece together how this feel good film will end. How creative to use a town in the wilderness as a setting and tell this fun tale. The tale also has some depth with a great meaningful message about acts of kindness. It is through this and the magic of Christmas that we see a hostile town transformed to a happy town. The film does not try too hard to weave in the traditional Christmas stories and legends into it but effortlessly makes references to it. Christmas movies can take a page out of Klaus's book on how to make a good Christmas film.
Klaus (2019),I wish all the Christmas movies were like Klaus,"I took a chance on this and so glad I did. This is a truly original script that takes you on a journey and has something for everyone to enjoy. A little intrigue, a little romance, a little heartache with characters you will fall in love with. Great casting choices for the voices with a particular spotlight on Klaus. This movie will leave you completely satisfied and ready to watch it again and again every Christmas. I just wish all the Christmas movies coming out had this much quality in their script, story and casting. I saw in someone else's review, ""in a sea full of Christmas movies, Klaus stands out"" and I could not agree MORE!"
Klaus (2019),We watch this one again and again,"This one has become a Christmas staple in my household. We HAVE to watch it every year and every year we both laugh and cry over this movie. Not only is the animation of it top notch, the casting very good and the story surprisingly fresh for a tale as old as time, the flow of the film is absolutely perfect. It has everything from the moments you detest to the moments that you love. It has characters that you fall in love with at first sight and characters that you learn to love over the course of the film. Oh and it absolutely has characters you dislike too. All and all it is one that we keep coming back to. And honestly? It should have won that Oscar! 😉"
Klaus (2019),Best christmas movie!,"The film is a work of Christmas art, starting with the characters who are charismatic, the dubbing is excellent, very funny and super fun, we evolve with the characters during the film and we start to like them more and more, I loved the death scene of the Klaus' wife, we don't know the character but just from the revelation, their story makes you feel bad with Klaus, or in the scene where a member of the Krums destroys the wall between the rival clan showing that things are different now, and the best character: Jesper, he starts out as annoying (and he really is) but as time goes by in that place, living with people and increasingly caring about them, creating a butterfly effect throughout the city is the most incredible thing in the world. Film, since we saw everything he went through and faced to make this, not to mention the other characters who are great too. The script is phenomenal and the story is super interesting, it's so cool that you feel like you're in that city, you feel like a civilian from that place, like for example, the revelation of the fake gifts at the end, in many works you would know that they They are fake gifts because you see more than the characters, in that Klaus is a civilian in that city and discovers things with the characters. I loved the soundtrack and the direction is phenomenal, this film deserved the Oscar, this film is the true winner of the 2019 Oscar!"
Klaus (2019),A mesmerizing Christmas classic,"It is the fourth year I come back to see this movie and I am still excited, amazed and brought to tears. Klaus is a modern twist to the classic tale of Santa Klaus. The big-city spoiled child motive is elegantly incorporated into the story with Jasper. The whole movie is perfectly written and executed whilst the style of animation leaves you in awe. The soundtrack is blended well and succeeds in it's goal to make you emotional and immerse you into the scenes. The ending is powerful yet simple and delivers the final piece of the puzzle that ""stamps"" this movie's status as an absolute classic."
The Grinch (2018),Good modern retelling of a classic story,"Too many get caught up in absolutes. You either change everything or change nothing for a minor subset of people on either side. The old Seuss purists deride this story as not faithful, while others deride it as run of the mill with nothing new. After all, what's the point in telling the things exactly the same based on a societal viewpoint decades old, and little point in changing everything including the original message. In the end, the story is about the core of the Christmas spirit with spending and enjoying time with family and friends, not about the material goods that our capitalistic society has pushed. That is the message of Dr. Seuss' original story and of this movie. Pharrell's narration pays homage to the original animation that felt lacking in the live action Carrey movie. Cindy Lou coming from a single parent home winds up resonating with more families these days, and not the nuclear family ideal from the original story. The Grinch is still humbuggish doing mean things to in an attempt to interrupt other people's happiness. The gadgetry from Dr. Seuss' story's comes to play and fits and looks better in this movie. Finally the lyrical nature of the lines, feels like I'm listening to Dr. Seuss' stories. I'm neutral on the redo of the song. Its not bad, but I would have gone with something more along the lines of something Taylor Swift or Kelly Clarkson would sing. Things I would have done without is the whole reindeer search and screaming goat, it felt unnecessary. Instead it could have incorporated more of what Cindy Lou tried in the live action movie, while giving the Who's viewpoint of more mean deeds the Grinch had done in the past."
The Grinch (2018),Not close to the story,"This movie deviates very far from the book. Very far from what Dr. Suess would have accepted. There are missing things that occured in the book that were left out of this movie. There are a few funny moments, but otherwise it isn't enjoyable. I gave it a chance. I found it very unenjoyable soon after the beginning but I kept watching to see if it would get better. It did not. What happened to the crumbs too small for a mouse? What happened to carving the roast beast? These were important parts of the book but left out in this movie. The Grinch's actions were even wrong. The way Max acts is even wrong. Where did the ram and yak come from? If you know and love the book, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie."
The Grinch (2018),Not good at all ..,Everything about it was just not good. Nothing about this version was rememberable. It doesn't even have any of the classic Dr Seuss rhymes . Most the characters were a disappointment. For some reason Cindy Loo wasn't really as interesting in this version. I don't know there was no connection to any of the characters. The music was horrible just modern pop and even a rap song? The music is what should stand out and make the movie better and fun but the music was just silly and even a little ridiculous. Just no . No thank you . I don't even know how people could rate this more than five stars. I guess some people found it enjoyable but it just didn't have that spark for me .
The Grinch (2018),Ok I like it I really it,"First I'm not doubting that this movie strayed far from the book but somehow it worked. I like the humor, I like the animation, and I love the actor Benedict Cumberbatch for playing a likable jerk in the movie. Somehow it got me loving Fred the weird deer. I understand why some people didn't like it but I can't not like it. I say it's a treat for the kids, it's a treat for the family to like, and even adults might like it. I admit I can be a loner and it stresses me sometimes being around people and so I know how it feels when Grinch was wondering around in a crowd and he had an anxiety attack from social anxiety. Not only it touches on child trauma but it touches how easy it is to feel like an outsider when people ignore you. Enjoy this movie for the laughs and fun."
The Grinch (2018),Grinchy Just Isn't That Evil,"The Grinch is an okay movie. This movie is a remake of a remake. I never watched the original ""movie"" made in the 60's, but I didn't like the Jim Carrey Grinch movie made in 2000. Jim Carrey was great, but the movie itself just wasn't great. This movie thought, it's okay. I think Benedect Cumberland had a very nasal voice for the Grinch. The Grinch himself was just not evil like he was in the book. He was just a depressed jerk who was just really scared to go down there in Whoville. I gotta admit though, at times this movie is really funny, but every kids movie is a comedy. This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't great. I mean, it's better than the Lorax. In all I give this a 6.2 out of 10."
The Grinch (2018),Fabulous Movie (10/10).,"Well, I Figured I'd Do This Movie At This Time Of Month. Get Y'all's Snacks, Food, & Drinks, & Enjoy This Review. Well, After That Abysmal 2000 Live-Action Version, We Get This 1ne. Let Me Tell You, This Was Fabulous. Definitely An Improvement To That 2000 Version. Now If You Ask Me If I Like The 1966 Classic Or This Version, I'd Say Both. Now Let's Go For Characters & Songs. Grinch Was A Cool Character Just Like 1966 Version, Max Was At His Best Like Always (Including The Bad 2000 Version), Cindy-Lou Who Was Very Sweet Character Like In 1966 Version, Groopert Was Charming, Fred The Fat Reindeer Is Funny, & Every Other Character Were Fun, Cute, Amazing, & Hilarious. As For The Songs & OST's, The Songs From The 1966 Classic Definitely Deserved A Remastered. The OST Are Great. Well, That's My Review. Be Prepared For The Other 2. RATING: Fabulous Movie (100/100)."
The Grinch (2018),Does The Dr. Seuss Story Proud . . . .,"I consider some TV shows and movies so ""classic"" that I refuse to watch any type of remake of them. ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" (1966) is one of them. Or was one of them until this weekend. While Hades will freeze over before I watch the 2000 non-animated version of the story, I saw this animated 2018 version at Peacock and decided why not? I figured I could turn it off if anything in it offended me, or if it was sacrilegious in any way, shape or form. My, my, all that worrying for nothing! This is an absolutely delightful remake of Dr. Seuss' Christmas story. In two ways it's sweeter than the original, too. One, it explains why the Grinch so hates Christmas. Two, the Grinch is not cruel at all to his dog Max. In this movie, Max is his only friend and companion. There is also a chubby reindeer named Fred, the only one in a huge herd that the Grinch could catch to pull his sled. Fred turned out to be more help than the Grinch ever realized he could be. Cindy Lou Who is not a toddler in this film, but looks about six years old. She encounters the Grinch on Christmas Eve not by accident, but intentionally, because she wants to ask Santa Claus something. Many of the residents in Whoville are very funny, especially Bricklebaum, who loves Christmas as much as the Grinch hates it. All the voice jobs are great, including the narrator. So, have no fears of watching this movie if you are a fan of the 1966 show, but don't touch the 2000 non-animated version even with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!"
The Grinch (2018),A good children's movie,The movie is good especially for children. Funny and entertaining version that keeps the kids attention. This newer version has lots more Grinch interaction. He's not as mean as the original movie. The actors add a new twist on the main characters. Max is the best character. He is sweet and has genuine emotions that make you enjoy each scene he's in. However the soundtrack sucks. The rap is awful. That man cannot carry a tune to save his life! Off key and just plain bad. How this guy got a record deal baffles me. There are a few decent songs but the main artist lacks even the most basic singing abilities. Sorry not sorry!
The Grinch (2018),I wanted to like it.,"I grew up with Boris Karloff as well as Jim Carrey. While I love Jim Carrey, it always seemed too fixated on jokes and jabs rather than the story. So with the new adaptation, I wondered if they'd remedy that. They did not. Where Boris and Jim brought life, character, and instant nostalgia, this movie only brought your run of the mill modern animation style and a few forgettable jokes. An unrelated critique was the sheer amount of new material - why? Why make Suzie-loo's mother single? Why write in a reindeer just so you can miss an iconic line from the original and the 2000's movie? (""If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead."") As far as I can see, they were trying so hard to be different that they lost track of the actual story. I hope one day studios can finally take the hint that we, as movie watchers, are done with remakes. It's tired, vapid, and makes a mockery of good stories. Please, for the sake of future generations, make new material. At this point, my children will be brought up on movies/shows made prior to the 2010's, as much of what's been made since then (with exceptions) has been uninspired."
The Grinch (2018),"Grinch, Perfectly Reimagined!","I'm not one to go crazy over a new version of a movie, especially when it was nailed so well the first time! I love the classic How The Grinch Stole Christmas, but this version is beautifully reimagined. Obviously, as a longer movie, we get more context around the Grinch. And while some find it hard to connect with, I loved this version of the story! More so because I am a mom of a preschooler, and this movie was an exceptional story for sharing the Christmas spirit with children that young. It's definitely the feel-good story of the season! Pharrell is the narrator, bringing a fresh, new take. The movie also combines the classic grinch music and classic Christmas songs with more modern songs. It's entertaining."
Wish (II) (2023),Pretty good,"The animation was ok. Songs did not make my ears bleed. And the moral of the story is meaningful Though the songs were not catchy, ""This wish "" was actually pretty catchy to me. I am not lying but telling the truth. Even though Disney has failed, but it's still ok lah. Have to agree with the animation being not so-good though. But i will still forgive them. They threw in a few Dsney refencres though. I hope that Disney can continue to make great films like this in the future. Anyway , that's it for now. Stay happy and bye!(smile's)
Love

(Ps I need this review to be shortrer) Oh and Hi."
Wish (II) (2023),5 for the trailer,"Have to apologise. First review I've done for a movie I havnt actually watched. Probably dosnt help that this is shrouded with the worst Disney reviews and box office takings nearly ever. Based on the Trailer and my kids response,
They pretty much said ""that was the most boring trailer they have ever seen!"" And had zero interest in watching it. Which says a lot as they are huge Disney fans! And I agree. What were Disney thinking? Disney movies of late are big bright & cute with meaningful cultural mythological back stories. Not sure I like the new visual effects technique that brings old and new together. Just seems like a remastered 50s cart. They've failed in the marketing and delivery. What a shame. Hopefully they learn from this."
Wish (II) (2023),An Excellent Return to Tradition,"A blend of hand-drawn animation and CGI in the art style. An original story not based on a book. Not a needless sequel. A Disney movie that is not a shameless cash-grabbing remake. A straightforward villain rather than the overtired twist cliche. A young protagonist who is flawed, makes mistakes, can lose a fight, and is not an extraordinarily, way over-the-top perfect Mary Sue. Good vs evil story with themes of friendship, love, dedication. Comedy, drama, scary, hopeful. Well-written characters, fantastic songs and music. No political or sociological messages anywhere. Just pure, fresh, glorious entertainment. This movie is everything that fans and detractors of Disney Feature Animation have been asking from the studio for years. What more can they want?"
Wish (II) (2023),Magnifico deserved better,"I would have rated a little higher but Magnifico's wrap up felt rushed and undeserved - why didn't his wife even consider he could be saved from the dark magic? It's like she just forgot that they were in love or something. Irritating and perplexing. He seemed like he had good intentions initially, and the storytelling sets this out in some detail, but somewhere along the way he seems to have lost sight of what he was trying to achieve with his new kingdom. He's denying the free will of his people, it seems, not because he's malevolent but simply because he doesn't want the same thing to happen in his new home. Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention at the start and he truly was evil - I guess it was pretty sad that the grandpa had to go through his whole long life without fulfilling his biggest dream. I'll watch again. All the voice actors did a fine job, but Chris Pine was wonderful, had the best musical number and if Magnifico can be redeemed in a sequel perhaps I'll rethink the rating."
Wish (II) (2023),"Absolutely loved it. Yes, some of the critiques are correct, but it's a beautiful love story to 100 years of Disney","I truly don't understand how this movie is getting so much hate...yes, there was some character development lacking, but it's a children's movie and it's already an hour and a half long. I absolutely loved Wish. I thought it was a beautiful love story to 100 years of Disney. I loved the little nods to Disney films, I loved the music, I loved the characters, I loved the laughs, and I loved the ending. I have seen it three times with my daughter and we can't get enough. I tear up during ""This Wish"" and at the ending every time. Ariana DeBose is a treasure. You can tell that she's a Broadway actress by the way you feel the emotion through her singing. Chris Pine was probably miscast as the singing voice for Magnifico and should have only done his speaking voice, but he can carry a tune at least. I think the only reason this movie didn't live up to box office expectations was because of Trolls coming out the week before. Anyone that's tearing Wish apart clearly is not a fan of Disney and hasn't seen some of their movies that are ACTUALLY terrible (i/e: Bolt, Chicken Little, Home on the Range)."
Wish (II) (2023),A Wonderful Family film,"I saw this film in the cinema with my entire family. And we enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Us as adults. Have also enjoyed the 2D and 3D effects in a film. And they merged seamlessly into each other, giving it its own magical world. Great respect for the animators. The music and songs were also very beautiful like the song. The Wish , this is the thanks I get ! Im a star. Disney has finally responded again to include a real Disney villain. King magnifico.which is wonderfully voiced by Chris Pine, which we did not expect that he could sing so well. Actress Ariana DeBose was also very good, she set the right tone in her speaking and especially in her fantastic singing, what a performance All in all a wonderful film for the whole family."
Wish (II) (2023),"Entertaining, but forgettable. Just ok. Disney you can do better","So. For a 100 year anniversary movie, yes this movie was lacking. But from just a watchability entertainment value? It was ok. The animation is good. The Comedy and the side kick characters are great. Particularly Alan Tyduks character and his voice acting. Made it bearable. But aside from the animation and the comedic/cute characters this movie doesn't really stick in the memory. To me this movie feels like the definition of ""close, but no cigar"". Also let's break down the message of this movie. Usually Fairy Tales and even most Disney movies have an easily recognizable and uplifting theme or central message to them. IE Moana = Exploring is a great thing, Wreck it Ralph = Accept yourself and you're great the way you are, Elemental = Diverse people can work together and learn to love even when vastly different. Or themes similar to those concepts. So what was the actual message of this movie? Hard to tell. I think it was ""Wishes aka dreams are worth being followed even if you risk getting hurt"". Don't know if that's the best message to tell kids man. But here's the really weird thing about this movie- The King or the hero Asha are neither outright wrong or right. They're just particular points of view on what to do with the wishes. What I mean is the King wants to protect wishes. That's not a bad goal right? He's trying to protect people. That's not a bad thing. It's just the way and method he's going about it that are bad. Asha wants everyone to be free to follow their dreams/""wishes"". She wants freedom for others. That's not a bad goal either. But what if there really are some wishes that shouldn't be granted because some people really do have fd up dreams that hurt others? Maybe some dreams really do require protection or at least guidance to work with other people. Control without consent or support is Bad. And unrestrained freedom without boundaries or guidance is Bad. Appropriate guidance and organization with freedom of desire is good. It's the synergetic combination that's the goal and the sweet spot. So ideally the King and Asha should have worked together to come up with something new and better that included both of them. So that's what, intellectually at least, makes this Disney movie really unique. The ""villain"" the King isn't all bad. The ""hero"" isn't all good. Both of them are actually BOTH 'bad' AND 'good'. I 'WISH' that the King and Asha would have come together to creates something new and better though. That's my wish for this movie. Do a Remake on this Disney. You're good at remakes. Maybe you'll get it right this time."
Wish (II) (2023),Another Boring Disney Box Office Flop,"I was very excited for this movie. The idea of every bit of Disney magic coming together in1 giant movie sounds amazing doesn't it? Well, It's execution is just bland and boring. I really wanted them to have a story more related to When You Wish upon a star. Instead it felt like Disney doing a parody of their own movies. The characters were boring, and their development just felt very rushed. The songs also do not feel memorable and also ripped off from other Disney movie. The first song in this movie is parallel to 'The Family Madrigal' from Encanto, where the main character introduces us to the main plot, and it feels uninspired. The villain also is pretty forgettable and unoriginal. I was gonna give is a 4, but some of the humor was pretty well done, so that rounds up so a 5 (being very generous)."
Wish (II) (2023),Typically Disney - no surprises,"I saw this movie in Danish with my kids in the cinema as a Christmas present. Since we don't go to the cinema often, it was an overall nice family experience. The movie is a typical Disney movie. There were no surprises in this. I felt entertained and occasionally moved, but it was not a movie, that is gonna stick. It feels like Disney made a compilation of a lot of other Disney movies. I felt especially reminded of Vajana and Jafar and if I would reflect more on it, there will be more characters, that I will recognize. I would not neccessarely recommend this movie, but I would also not say ""Don't watch it, it's a waste of time"". There are definitly other movies, where time is more well spend, but there are also worse movies out there."
Wish (II) (2023),A Missed Opportunity,"In an era where animated films often redefine the boundaries of storytelling and visual artistry, it's disheartening to see a studio with the pedigree of Disney deliver something as uninspired as Wish. The film, unfortunately, continues the recent trend of Disney's offerings feeling more like formulaic retreads than the innovative masterpieces we once eagerly anticipated. Wish stands as a particularly glaring example of this decline. While it boasts a visually appealing watercolor-inspired aesthetic, this artistic choice alone can't mask the movie's fundamental shortcomings. The narrative lacks the depth and nuance that once made Disney films universally appealing. Instead, we're presented with a collection of recycled elements: a predictable protagonist, a cookie-cutter antagonist, a character designed seemingly for merchandising purposes, and a soundtrack that, while competent, fails to leave a lasting impact. The primary audience for Wish is, of course, children. They might find enjoyment in the film, but it's a fleeting and superficial pleasure, akin to the temporary distraction offered by shows like Peppa Pig or Paw Patrol. There's an absence of the magic and inspiration that could make ""Wish"" a memorable experience for its young audience. Ultimately, the film is an example of wasted potential, showcasing high-quality animation without the compelling story or characters needed to make it truly resonate."
Leo (I) (2023),Really good for families,"This is a very solid movie which I watched tonight with my family. My family- other than my little sister- had very low expectations. Adam Sandler and Bill Burr are not our favorites. But yet, this movie is very enjoyable. It's very funny at points, and really heart touching. However if I would complain about something? The music. If you didn't know before you watch it, this is a musical. The joke is that the music isn't good and the singing is bad. However, the movie overuses this joke and it gets a bit annoying. The standout character to me? The drone of the boy with hypochondriac parents."
Leo (I) (2023),Pretty good,"It was cute,nothing interesting when it comes to the music though. But the plot was nice,I enjoyed the story. Definitely a good family movie. I like that they casted Adam Sandler as the lizard. He's one of my favorite actors. Has a pretty good message about confiding in someone with your feelings. Also how crying is good for your emotional well being. I really enjoyed that part. I really enjoyed the message of the movie as well as helping your friends out when they need help. Again,nothing outstanding for the music really,I don't think I'll remember any of the songs by heart. But other than that I liked it."
Leo (I) (2023),Adam Sandler is not a good cast,"I saw this somewhere but the only thing worse than Adam Sandler trying to be funny is Adam Sandler trying to be touching This movie had way to many jarring cuts and in the end the whole conflict is revealed to have weight makes rewatches kinda worthless The humor is gross and some scenes have bad visuals gags that make me what to gag The visual department is fine but the characters have weird proportions that aren't cartoony, just
unsettling This feels like another cash grab by Netflix and it does not Also it shows blatant animal abuse which is wild that fact they think showing two animals that need a lot more space like that is revolting Anyways im gonna go wash my eyes."
Leo (I) (2023),Helpful musical lizard,"I honestly was not expecting much out of an animated Adam Sandler musical, mostly because I was thinking it was going to be a standard movie on Netflix, but I wanted to give it a chance to change my opinion on it; after watching it, I thought it was better than I thought it was going to be. The Netflix animated movie Leo (2023) was a funny and enjoyable animated musical that has good voice acting and good songs that could be funny; there is also some kind of message involving being able to talk to anyone you know about any issues you are having and help you with them. Adam Sandler does do a respectable job as Leo, though you might find his voice a bit weird, you will get used to it as you keep watching the movie; he was funny with jokes about how old he is, the years he had lived through, and usually about kids, teachers, and parents. Leo's friend, who stays in the same terrarium in the classroom, Squirtle, who was voiced well by Bill Burr, does have scenes and is usually just talking to Leo when he is talking about escaping or talking to the kids in the classroom; he does eventually help in the third act. I also liked how Leo is trying to do what he can to help the kids in the classroom, because he knows how old he is and how long he has until a certain age that is coming close. The animation is good, and the movie was funny with it having funny lines of dialogue and funny sight gags in the background or as the central focus; the songs in the movie are not bad with them also being funny, and the singing voices from Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are good. What was surprising for me was that the movie had quite a few touching/heartfelt moments that are effective; also, what I will add is that the movie does have a liar reveal story in it that could be annoying, and the movie could have had a shorter runtime because the third act felt a bit stretched out. The Netflix animated movie Leo (2023) was better than I thought it was going to be, and though it is not a perfect animated musical, it was still entertaining and funny to watch; Adam Sandler does do a decent job as the main character, which makes the movie watchable. I am not going to say to go and rush onto Netflix to watch this, but I will say this an animated musical I would watch at least once, especially for those who were skeptical about it and did not know what to think about it."
Leo (I) (2023),"Good Movie, but not sure who the target audience is","Netflix's 'Leo' is a captivating blend of high-quality animation and heartfelt storytelling. The film features a lovable main character, Leo, who resonates with Adam Sandler's best works in terms of emotional depth. Although its pace is leisurely and its themes more mature, the movie strikes a chord with adult audiences, offering a rich, introspective experience. While it's a family-friendly film, its slower rhythm and profound message might not fully engage children under 10. Teenagers and young adults might find the plot somewhat sappy, potentially alienating the 15-25 age group. Nevertheless, 'Leo' shines in its ability to weave a narrative that's both engaging and emotionally rich. The inclusion of Leo's buddy, Squirtle, adds a delightful touch to the story. Overall, 'Leo' is a testament to the power of animation in storytelling, appealing to those who appreciate the genre and offering a lot for families with diverse tastes and ages to enjoy."
Leo (I) (2023),Fun family movie,"Enjoyed the story line: A class lizard goes home each weekend with a different student in the class and helps them with an issue they are having. The characters were fantastic: the students are stereotypical and the teachers and parents are on point. Loved the main animal characters Leo and Squirtle. The musical side wasn't all that great: the songs were slow and boring. They should have just stuck to the storyline and the fun of it. A fun movie to watch as a family. There are a few ""adult"" humour jokes, but they go right over their heads. Would definitely recommend watching this movie. Check it out."
Leo (I) (2023),Hilarious and surprisingly heartwarming movie!,"Leo is a nice movie! I was actually pleasantly surprised by this movie. To be honest, at first I thought this would be a terrible, low-budget, and extremely boring movie directed towards kids But I found myself laughing and even tearing up a little at the ending. The jokes were hilarious. The casting was great. The animation was amazing. As a kids movie, this is great! Your kids will be taught huge life lessons that they most likely will never forget. This is my personal opinion, but I think that this would be better as just a movie and not a musical. I didn't know it was a musical until we started watching Leo. The singing was great, don't get me wrong. Adam Sandler has a great voice, even when he's a lizard, and the students were nice too. I just think it would do better as a non-musical. Other than that, Leo is such a sweet and ridiculously funny musical that kids and adults will enjoy and maybe, just possibly, tear up at."
Leo (I) (2023),Adorable,"Ok. I went into this thinking the 'worst movie of the year'. It'll be fun to MST3000K the whole time. It didn't happen, the times I was going to make fun the movie did it for me. I don't have children but I would assume most kids will love. Plus, it's just a damn ""feel good"" movie. I absolutely loved it. I hate the character limit. I have nothing to else to add. I can tell you about my day! Well, I was at work and Becky started to say that Emily is not the mother of the child she is carrying! ... OMG. It was soooo awkward! I mean what is she doing carrying another woman's baby!? She has NO CLASS! ..... thank you and Goodnite.."
Leo (I) (2023),Literally so terrible,"It's just so painfully unfunny. I made a whole IMDb account because of how bad it was. Like, yeah, tell your kid to stop crying and shut up because they're being annoying, that's a great idea! A wonderful message to be sending to kids, too. It just made me irrationally angry. Animations can be rather disturbing as well. Didn't make it through the whole movie but most of it. I have no idea why all the other reviews are so overwhelmingly positive. The intent of the messages seemed good, but it definitely backfired. Hard. Watch literally anything else on Netflix. It tries so hard to make a point yet it accomplishes nothing. Most horrible movie I've ever seen."
Leo (I) (2023),LOVED IT!,"This was a feel good movie with great messages for all ages! You won't go wrong watching Leo! My 9 year old grandson loved it every bit as much as both his parents and his grandpa & I did! We giggled & laughed & learned a great deal! Kids from 1 - 100 years old will love this! It's always awesome that Adam Sandler includes his family & best friends in his movies! We always enjoy the 80's music from our era too! Skip anything you were considering watching! Stop trying to figure out what might look good & just watch Leo! I don't normally buy movies, but I will definitely be buying this one! It's one movie you can watch over & over & not be bored!"
A Christmas Carol (2009),Cinematic,"This movie, about a Victorian-era miser taken on a journey of self-redemption, is a great fantasy movie! It's an adventurous cinematic experience filled with elements consisting of everything from horror to joy to tragedy. The animation is slightly outdated where it now looks like cut-scenes from the game Read Dead Redemption 2 (2018), but if you set your mind like it's 2009, it's actually visually stunning. The movie has a great attention to details, and there's a lot to discover during the protagonist Scrooge's journey. I personally find it less enjoyable from when Scrooge gets hunted by the coachman until he sees his own tombstone because the action feels more coincidental than purposeful, but that's only for that part. The rest is very captivating and touching. Anyway, it's noticeable that the actors do their best because their performances perfectly complete the characters, and the cinematography and the fantastic sound design make the movie a great example of an experience fitting for the big screen. The score also helps to create a diverse atmosphere that introduces vibes like Christmas in general, but also suspense and excitement. Overall, the movie contains a beautiful story with a unique experience for the Christmas holiday. This is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant movie that offers a unique cinematic experience. The animation may be slightly outdated, but the performances, cinematography, and sound design are all top-notch. A must-see for anyone seeking a captivating Christmas story."
A Christmas Carol (2009),Simply the worst ever version,"After Tom Hanks performed multiple roles in ""The Polar Express,"" the egomaniacal Jim Carey no doubt couldn't rest until he surpassed Hanks, at least in the number of roles played in a single movie. But as always he utterly overacted each role, putting the many fine nuances of Dickens's extraordinary classic into the background. Fortunately, he was unable to make this inconsistent travesty of the original story any worse: it was so bad, so full of preposterous variations on the original, that it would have been impossible to bring it lower. As the movie progresses, scenes increasingly diverge from the original until the beautiful messages Dickens embedded in the story are overwhelmed by pretentious and unnecessary histrionics. As I say, the worst if the 30 something versions I've seen."
A Christmas Carol (2009),7 stars...but why?,"Now before we get to the negatives let us just say that the animation and execution was fantastic. The style and how each visit was different from one to another was breathtaking at times. But why only 7 stars. In the book there was a very important bit of writing that goes as such. 'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it.' cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end.' It might just be one of the most important lessons in the book. Eb was appealed by his father which made him the person he was and by those words of the spirit he understood the ""why"" behind being generous, charitable and furthering mankind. It is a great lesson for this era."
A Christmas Carol (2009),Faithful Adaptation-Hit And Miss Effects,"Some reviewers have called this a ""new"" twist. Uh, no. It is, almost word for word, scene for scene, a faithful adaptation of the original book by Dickens. The good? Gorgeous scenery, intriguing camera angles and Scrooge's familiar character arc from curmudgeon to repentant soul trying to get things right. The not so good? The first two ghosts (also played by Carrey) are obnoxiously weird. Christmas Past looks like Jim Carey's smirking head floating incongruously above a wispy phantom torso. And Christmas Present is a jarring, cackling boor, with forced belly laughing at the most bizarre times. This is not a movie for young viewers. From the beginning funeral for Marley, complete with coins on the dead man's eyes, it is (as originally written) a macabre tale filled with terrifying images. The ghost of Marley is horrific. Most of the motion capture is mesmerizing, with only a few supporting characters looking flat and poorly animated. The film also cries out for a more inspiring musical score, instead relying on the crazy antics of multiple characters performed by Carrey to move the story along. Despite all this, I recommend it as a true book to movie transition, with some beautiful visuals."
A Christmas Carol (2009),Interesting Interpretation but animation style gets creepy.,"Not a bad interpretation of A Christmas Carol and parts of the animation were great but then parts were rather creepy in a bad way and I don't mean the Ghosts/Spirits. Especially the children. You have great realism in parts and then AI type demon children. Strange way to make a movie. As for the dialog, kinda boring and parts of the spirits were either to vague to hear or just annoying. Jim Carrey performed okay but it's rather monotone overall. Same goes with the spirits. The movie was visually appealing but the tone was rather plain and could of been better. It's like you have one emotion and one emotion only throughout the movie. I think they were trying to go with a literal interpretation of A Christmas Carol but could of been better if not for the weird animation style and lack of overall emotion throughout the movie. Even the transformation comes across as unnatural and forced. Not a bad movie but could of been better."
A Christmas Carol (2009),"The horror, the horror!","British Reviewer. Although a score of 7.8/10 is quite high for an overly long, ridiculously Hollywood-ified version of Charles Dickens' novella A Christmas Carol. The sheer will and effort of Jim Carrey smashes this one out of the park and makes it a Christmas classic. Zemeckis really dragged out some shots, like the scene with the sign above the shop. The car-chase with a miniature Scrooge went on for AGES, I mean, Ebenezer is clearly terrified already by the prospect of his imminent demise. Does he really need pursuing by a carriage pulled by hell-beasts? Lastly, the grotesqueness of the characters is likely the most accurate portrayal of Victorian poor people but hilariously this is almost certainly a shortcoming of the animation style they chose to use."
A Christmas Carol (2009),alright,The movie is about a grumpy old guy named scrooge who is not a fan of Christmas a bit. One night three ghost come and visit him. First the ghost shows him his own childhood and how it was. Then a different ghost shows the grandpa how others celebrate Christmas. Then the final ghost shows him into the future how he will be alone and spend his life alone. Then a plot twist happens and come Christmas morning the old grandpa is not grumpy anymore and now he is actually in the Christmas mood and goes around cheering and yelling to everyone saying merry Christmas and is acting like a child to everyone.
A Christmas Carol (2009),I want my time back.,"My husband finally got me to watch this with him tonight after him owning it for several years. This was the utmost boring thing ever. For the first 55 minutes, there were several 5 minute scenes that could have been only 30 seconds each. Also, I could not understand ninety percent of what anyone was saying, and could not figure out who some people were in relation to others due to that. The only good thing about this is that it finally ended. There's really nothing else to say about this but I'm required to type in a certain amount of characters. I can not see myself ever watching this again unless by force."
A Christmas Carol (2009),Old man is terrorized by ghosts,"The tale of a greedy old man named Scrooge being taught a lesson on how Christmas is important is a tale almost as old as time. This rendition of the movie is probably my favorite take on this old tale. I love and hate the animation style (it gives me the heeby jeebies) but I am also a huge fan of anything that has to do with Jim Carrey so it may just be a personal bias. I also appreciate that no matter how many times this story is told they always seem to deliver the message on across, on how important Cherishing the ones around us are and how Christmas isn't all just presents and money. Instead it's showing love to our family by not only presents but just being grateful we have them."
A Christmas Carol (2009),Don't be a scrooge,"This movie was an amazing movie to watch throughout its entire runtime. The animation throughout the movie was spectacular while also giving off very disturbing vibes throughout certain scenes. One particular scene that stood out to me and showed just how well the movie's animation and writing could be both disturbing while also entertaining would be when Scrooge was talking with the ghost of a Christmas present. Throughout the entire interaction I was both enthralled by the movements the camera used to convey motion throughout the town and at the same time horrified by the way the ghost of Christmas past interacted with scrooge during his death. The casting I thought was amazing and it's always good to see Jim Carrey not just play a comedy role but instead play a more serious, down to earth character. The only criticism I think I have to point out is that the movie's story is just like other movies out there. Someone who hates Christmas but later learns his lesson and becomes a joyful man has been used so much and probably done better by other movies that I have to deduct a single point. Other than that this movie is one that I feel like can be enjoyed by everyone in the family and I would totally recommend it for the holiday season."
The Lion King (2019),It doesn't work.,"My kids have been watching the original Lion King near daily after pre school. To mix things up we put this one on instead. It struggles to recapture the magic the original still has. However, that is a high bar to achieve. It looks beautiful, the voice lines are great, and the music is nice. However, it looks too realistic to then apply dialogue to. It simply doesn't work and makes it a challenge to vibe with the movie. The dichotomy of extremely realistic looking animals talking like cartoon characters is too disruptive. This makes me wonder if it was shown to a test audience at all. Or if it was just shown to the crew who worked on it, who would be reluctant to speak against it. The only thing that truly works for this film is the opening song because there's no dialogue. Even the title card for the film name felt jarring not being in red."
The Lion King (2019),Loses the charm of the original,"The high points were the the promise of reliving a great film of my childhood/young adult years. Alas, they were promises unfulfilled. Although I did enjoy this film I did not enjoy this anywhere near to the extent of the original. The charm was sapped out as the script writers tried to contrive original and remake and fell short. There were some poor casting choices but the acting should have been strong from at least some of the actors, yet there was no real feeling coming through, no fight, no heart, some hammy delivery. Disappointing. The visuals were great. It was wonderful seeing such life-like rendering in the animation and CGIs but it sits stiffly when the film is about anthropomorphic creatures, which then do not show the supposed feelings they are supposed to be conveying. It's a strange juxtaposition, especially when Walt Disney himself had worked so hard to get audiences to become emotionally connected to an animated story. Overall, a bit of a let down."
The Lion King (2019),"Visually good, it's ok","I'm not sure what people were expecting from the remake of an old story. Maybe they were expecting Die Hard with lions? It's a pretty faithful remake of the animated Lion King, but does miss something somewhere along the way. Visually it's pretty good, some say the animals lack expression, but you either have realism or make the animals weird with too much expression. Weirdly I thought Beyonce's voice ruined parts of the film as it just didn't seem to fit the character and her over the top shouty singing further ruining some of the music. Overall, it's ok, enjoy it and just go along for the ride."
The Lion King (2019),A Technological Marvel That Captures the Spirit of the Original,"""The Lion King"" (2019), directed by Jon Favreau, is a visually stunning reimagining of the beloved 1994 Disney classic. Utilizing groundbreaking photorealistic animation, the film brings the African savannah and its inhabitants to life with breathtaking detail and realism, offering a new experience of the iconic story for a modern audience. The voice cast in this rendition brings a fresh perspective to the familiar characters. Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala bring a vibrant energy to their roles, infusing the characters with emotional depth and a sense of maturity. James Earl Jones reprises his role as Mufasa, lending the same regal and wise presence that he brought to the original film. Chiwetel Ejiofor's portrayal of Scar is noteworthy, delivering a performance that is both menacing and nuanced, differentiating his character from the original while maintaining the essence of the villainous brother. The comedic relief provided by Billy Eichner as Timon and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa is delightful, capturing the spirit of the original characters while adding their unique touch. One of the film's most significant achievements is its groundbreaking animation technology. The animals and environments are rendered with such precision and detail that they blur the line between animation and live-action. This hyper-realistic approach brings a new level of immersion and awe to the film, making it a visual masterpiece. The soundtrack, featuring new renditions of the classic songs and a few new compositions, complements the film beautifully. Hans Zimmer's score is as powerful and moving as ever, and the new interpretations of songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" are both respectful of the originals and refreshingly modern. However, the film's adherence to photorealism comes at a cost. The emotional expressiveness found in traditional animation is somewhat lost in the pursuit of realism, leading to a disconnect between the characters' emotions and their facial expressions. This sometimes results in a lack of emotional impact in scenes that were more emotionally resonant in the animated version. The narrative stays largely faithful to the original, which is both a strength and a weakness. While it ensures the story remains true to what fans love, it also means the film offers few surprises or deviations, which could be a disappointment for those seeking a new take on the story. In conclusion, the 2019 version of ""The Lion King"" is a remarkable feat of technology and a beautiful tribute to the original film. It captures the essence of the story and its characters while providing a new level of visual splendor. While it may not evoke the same emotional depth as the 1994 animation, it stands on its own as a visually captivating and enjoyable retelling of a classic tale. It earns a solid 8 out of 10 for its technological achievements and its ability to bring a beloved story to life in a whole new way."
The Lion King (2019),Something new,"Truly a beautiful piece of animation (photorealistic animation) but something lacks what the hand drawn 1994 rendition had... there was more heart in the original that I think can be impossible to find with this new style of animation, it's almost like you can't take it all in because of how much detail had gone into creating everything in screen. It's true talent, and perhaps eventually once they've done more of the work, they'll be able to find the heart like they used to have. I would've liked to have seen Jeremy Irons reprised his role as Scar, and the new characterisation of the hyenas are drastically different in this adaptation; here they are more dangerous than comedic relief."
The Lion King (2019),Why does this movie even exist?,"Watch the original instead. It's a shot for shot remake of the animated version. The story is exactly the same but it lacks the charm and spirit of the original. This movie also had a lot of weird casting choices like John Oliver as Zazu, Seth Rogen as Pumbaa, and Beyonce as Nala. At least they brought back James Earl Jones to play Mufasa, but its not enough to save the movie from being a complete disaster. I also can't even tell if this is supposed to be an animated movie or a live action one because the animals are CGI but the landscapes are real. The CGI is very good though, but the characters are far less appealing and recognizable than their animated counterparts. Another problem is, you can't even tell what emotion the characters are feeling just by looking at them considering they're modeled after real animals. Also, why the hell did the writers think Timon and Pumbaa singing ""Be Our Guest"" in this movie was a good idea? Its really annoying. This is the worst of the Disney remakes in my opinion. Everything about the original Lion King was better. It might as well be called ""The Photorealistic Lion King"", because that's basically what it is."
The Lion King (2019),"Uneven tempo, unnecessary addons and not grand enough","I am of the belief that remakes are reserved for movies that in the broad spectrum considered bad. So I was reluctant to watch this movie when it came out even though I, as a kid, hoped to see a live-action version of my favorite animated movie, which is also why this review is 4 years late. I was wondering why this movie is almost 30 minuttes longer than the original, and I thought they might expand some before only implied tropes, such as the rules of the land, other characters relationships with the lions, but unfortunately not. Many characters that had charisma are totally gone. The hyenas are not comic relief as they were and their dynamic between them is also missing. The voice acting is also bland compared to the original, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are great as Timon and Pumba, and John Oliver also has his moments, though it was hard not to miss Rowan Atkinson. The spectacel of the scenery is stunning, but I still feel it pales compared to the original, such in scenes as the stampede, which seem much smaller and less impactful as well as the opening scene. The music, which to me at least, was by far the originals strong point, is sidelined with mere notes that reminds you of the original. The songs are cut short, such as Scars ""Be prepared"" and ""Can't wait to be king"", and instead we are treated with an original song by Beyoncé, which is good, but not compared to Elton John's songs. The movie also have a very odd tempo. Sometimes we seem to dwell to much on things that could easily just be left to the imagination, and other times we don't dwell enough on what the original was so good at. Now we dwell more on Scars relationship with Sarabi whom he wants as queen, for some reason, and Shenzi, who were just another one of the hyenas, is the leader, though she has no goal or doesn't make any impact on any of the lead characters, and Banzai and Azizi(Ed's replacement), do try but their banter doesn't fit into how we think of hyenas. The original played a lot on the trope that hyenas laugh, so the movie characters constantly make fun of eachother, situations etc. It's unfortunate, since the original was great at balancing horrible sadness with funny moments. Many of the voice actors also seem oddly cast. Disney marketed the movie by stating they would try to hire only african-americans for the leads. I know they mean well, but being from a country where English is not the mothertongue means that the will be dubbed regardless plus you can't always hear from a voice where people's ethnicity originates. The only thing that always was the same regardless where you come from was the music, which in the original, I felt celebrates Africa. The African a choir which sang in both Zulu and Swahilli as well as the African tunes were something I believe really stays with a lot of people when they remember the original. So all in all, the best thing about this movie is the things that it copied from the original and didn't try to improve all to much on. For parents I will always recommend the original, not just because of quality, but also due to the tempo and the length of the remake."
The Lion King (2019),Amazing CGI,"The CGI and digital effects in this movie are out of this world. Makes it all look so real, it's the thing I found most impressive about the film. As a kid who grew up watching Lion King time and time again, when it came to the Mufasa-Scar battle over the canyon, a part of me hoped the storyline would change as that scene is always heartbreaking. However, if they did change that turning point scene, the entire rest of the story would be completely different. The new jokes from Timon and Pumba fit it quite well and held true to the original characters. This film is visually a nice change of pace from the original but otherwise they are virtually the same, just with a new cast and new renditions of the songs."
The Lion King (2019),"Not bad, not awesome","A good film to watch with family members. The story line is the same as in previous versions of this film. The characters are funny and well animated, however more face expressions should be shown. The acting is good, but not better than previous versions of this film. Direction of the plot has a good pace, but the end is too fast, in my opinion. It is similar to other Hollywood films. Film's cinematogrophy is good. Best angles are shown, and the colour palette is wide and general's movie aesthetics has a good quality either. Film's soundtrack is good, but not extraordinary and does not add anything new to previous versions. Film's editing gives absorb's viewers curiosity. In general, it is a good film to watch with family members."
The Lion King (2019),Heartwarming,"It's one of the Disney movies that I really liked. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The action is well-paced and the storyline is captivating. I never got bored watching it. The movie doesn't contain too many unnecessary scenes which makes it pleasant to watch. Not to mention, the visuals are outstanding, and the animals appear remarkably realistic. You could easily mistake them for real characters. I was impressed by Simba and Nala's background stories and courage. Their character development was inspiring, and I appreciated the moments of humor that were woven into their portrayal. It's a heartwarming movie which you can enjoy watching with your entire family."
Chicken Run (2000),Lots of fun,"I can't believe it has taken me ages and ages to finally post an imdb review for Chicken Run. Actually, what prompted me was a New York Times article I read today about why it's taken so long to release Chicken Run 2, the sequel naturally to Chicken Run. Anyway, I saw Chicken Run on DVD when DVDs were popular and cost a lot of money. Anyway, Chicken Run is lots of fun and the creators didn't have the luxury of CGI and all to relax on. Anyway, I highly recommend Chicken Run and it's hard to believe the sequel has taken so long to be released but no doubt it will be worth the wait and all init."
Chicken Run (2000),Chicken Run (2000) and its anti-capitalist subtext,"Chicken Run is an animated film widely remembered for addressing anti-capitalist themes in its subtexts. To say that these subtexts are not included in the narrative is to watch it superficially. The anti-capitalist message is very visible, even in a children's film. These messages can be very controversial because they are in a film aimed at younger audiences. However, it is not something that will somehow influence children to follow some ideology. Those in power will remain in it and increasingly try to increase their wealth to become more powerful over those who are exploited. The characters do not believe they can live a different life, because they are limited to thinking in a different way as a result of the system in which they are inserted. In addition to these subtexts, the animation is good for managing to develop a very fun narrative with very effective comedy."
Chicken Run (2000),Aardman's first film work,"In the mid-2000s, films emerged that revolutionized the animation industry and Chicken Run has been one of them that is fondly remembered. After the Wallace & Gromit animated shorts, Aardman made its big film debut with this well-developed stop-motion film. On an artistic and artisanal level, it is a film well cared for in its production and character design. Ginger and Rocky are the best characters in the film, being very different, but who later end up forming a strong bond. Rocky is initially presented as a self-centered rooster who ends up empathizing with Ginger. Meanwhile, Ginger is a determined chicken with a strong character who shows how much she cares about her companions and how much she cares about them. The script knows how to keep the humor and seriousness that exists in the story balanced. It is a film with well-hidden social elements and critiques that make the story interesting to watch. Even the good development of the script and the emotionality make some errors present in the film easy to ignore. Chicken Run is definitely another masterpiece of ancient animation and a gem that can continue to be enjoyed to this day. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10."
Chicken Run (2000),Enjoyable,"Today, I re-watched this movie as it's sequel is out and I wanted to recollect the story of the original which I watched a long time ago. The story was simple and light hearted just like a children's story, the screenplay was decent, the direction was good, the animation was unique and the voice actors did a good job. The thrill elements were embedded nicely in the story which makes this movie more enjoyable. Overall, this movie was an enjoyable movie which you can watch with your family. I don't know if this story even needed a sequel as the story had a good conclusion but let's see what sequel has to offer."
Chicken Run (2000),A Feather-Ruffling Adventure,"""Chicken Run"" is an animated delight that will have audiences of all ages clucking with laughter and excitement. Set on a seemingly idyllic farm run by the tyrannical Mrs. Tweedy, the film follows a group of plucky chickens who dream of escaping their egg-laying fate.

The plot unfolds with a mix of clever wit and touching moments as the chickens, led by the intrepid Ginger and the charismatic rooster Rocky, concoct a daring scheme to achieve their freedom. The film expertly weaves together themes of friendship, courage, and the pursuit of dreams, creating a captivating story that resonates on multiple levels. The animation is charming and skillfully rendered, bringing the expressive characters and lively farm setting to vibrant life. The voice talent, including the talents of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, and Miranda Richardson, infuses the characters with personality and charm, making them instantly endearing to the audience. ""Chicken Run"" is a feather-ruffling adventure that effortlessly balances lighthearted humor with genuine emotional depth. With its engaging storyline, well-crafted animation, and memorable characters, this film is a plucky and heartwarming gem that will leave audiences cheering for these courageous chickens. Whether you're a child or a child at heart, ""Chicken Run"" is a must-see animated classic that will have you rooting for the underdogs from start to finish."
Chicken Run (2000),A good and funny classic,"This film stands out for its visual innovation, employing the stop-motion animation technique to create a more captivating aesthetic than conventional 3D animations. The narrative unfolds a captivating and creative story that seamlessly blends elements of comedy, adventure, and drama. The diverse characterization of characters, with each chicken possessing a distinct personality, fosters empathy with the audience. The film adopts a simple yet humorous style that appeals to both younger and older viewers. However, there are a few points in the narrative where the story could have delved deeper, providing a more profound and impactful experience. There's a sense that the filmmakers could have pushed further to convey a more potent message."
Chicken Run (2000),Escape or die frying,"I do love stop motion animation, and other than the stop motion animation studio Laika having great movies, the stop motion studio Aardman is fantastic with one of the movies they made back in the year 2000 called Chicken Run. Chicken Run (2000) has a great cast, great animation, and a villain who can be scary or threatening; there are some dark themes in the movie and the way everything looks is amazing how it is animated with lots of details and funny movements. The main chicken named Ginger voiced by Julia Sawalha takes every attempt to try to escape the chicken farm, and she has the dedication to get the rest of the chickens out of the farm to safety away from the terrible owners. The rooster Rocky voiced by Mel Gibson is launched into the chicken farm with the chickens believing he can fly so he can help them escape, with funny moments and a building relationship with Ginger. Also, the other chickens on the farm are weird and funny, with there being other characters who are rats who are getting items for the many plans the chickens use to escape the chicken farm, which is built like a prison. The villains are the owners of the chicken farm with one of them being scary and intimidating, and the other being an idiot seeing the chickens planning something but the intimidating one does not believe him; with their plan of turning the chickens into chicken pies. The stop motion animation is well done with the locations having a lot of details to it, and the characters having many expressions, details, and funny ways they tend to move around, other than using clay for certain things, they also use real objects in a way that is fun to watch when they use them in their plans to escape the farm. Chicken Run (2000) is a great Aardman stop motion movie that, if you like Aardman, you should give it a watch if you have not already, it is also a good movie to rewatch; it has great stop motion animation, nice characters, funny moments, and an effective villain. This movie is just a fun and entertaining time when watching; if you specifically like animation, you will enjoy this movie, and if you like stop motion films or specifically Aardman, then you will have fun with this film."
Chicken Run (2000),An animation in the depth of my childhood memories,"This animation is wonderful for me and full of childhood memories, most of my childhood was spent seeing and imagining these cute chicks. I am very satisfied with this animation. I remember that after watching this movie, I was thinking of making a flying car so that I could fly to the sky with it and travel to faraway places, even the plan of my so-called flying car on paper I waited, but alas, before I blinked, my childhood was over and how soon I grew up. Now my memories have come alive again and I am impatiently waiting for the second part of this movie to take me back to my childhood once again and travel in the pure world of imagination."
Chicken Run (2000),The great eggscape,"A movie I thought would go in one direction but ended up a bit aimless. Chicken Run is one of those claymation movies that you have to watch and while I enjoyed it, I wished it was way tighter and more affective than it ended up being. A plate was placed in front of me and I expected one thing, but the taste was not only different but also a bit too bland. A chicken farm is run by an evil woman which only focus is on profit. The chickens try to escape and are blessed with hope in the form of a flying rooster. What this movie does best is its comedy and the characters. All the characters are memorable and lovable, and the villains are fun and interesting. My favorite character and voice performance was Julia Sawalha as the lead Ginger. She brings so much sas and personality to the character, and having a strong and respectable female lead is awesome. She's such a lovable character not just focusing on her own escape but on everyone escaping together that's amazing. Other characters that I loved were the husband to the villain that was lovably dumb, the two rats and Babs the chicken being so oblivious as to what's going on at all time. The comedy is focused on the dialogue, and it works very well here. The visual gags are fine too. The character and actually the entire main focus that made the movie feel worse to me was the male lead Rocky. It's fun how we in this era of filmmaking always had to add a man just so there was one. The entire premise goes from prison escape to having fun and lying, and that's a really annoying premise when the original idea was fun too. Having to escape with everyone before we are all killed, yeah this is a kids' movie by the way. This movie could have been tighter and more focused, instead of being about a romance that doesn't matter and using so much time on a plot tread that goes nowhere. I wish this movie was something different, more like its opening promise and premise. I really loved the molded sets and backgrounds, expert the sky that looked a bit too fake. The opening on the mud on the ground and the metal fence looks so real and well done. The overall mouth and fluidity of the animation is amazing and never really seems like it stutters anywhere. The character designs are also really quirky, but don't really speak to me. The Claymation style is something that doesn't really look appealing to me, and it can look a bit ugly in my opinion. It clashes with the amazing prop department to me and makes the chickens look a worse. This movie should have been shorter than it is and with a more simple premise, it can feel long and patted also because we, the audience, know the premise is build on a lie. It is a simple premise with extra steps, and that did not speak to me at all. It also doesn't add to the outcome of the movie at all having the runaround with the male lead, and that just frustrates me. But Chicken Run is still a fun and enjoyable time. It has a lot of character and charm with amazing humor and animation, but to me needed a more compelling plot to really hit home with me."
Chicken Run (2000),Good stop motion animation flick,"Before the sequel which will have Thandie Newton and Zachary Levi replacing Mel Gibson and Julia Sawalha as Ginger and Rocky respectively, I decided to review the 2000 original Chicken Run which also stars Tony Haygarth,Miranda Richardson,Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall(both Spall,Staunton and Richardson all worked in Harry Potter). The plot follows Ginger(Sawalha)who is facing eventual certain death at the chicken farm where she is held. Together Ginger and Rocky(Gibson in his 2nd animated film after Pocahontas)the rooster, decide to rebel against the evil Mr. And Mrs. Tweedy(Haygarth and Richardson) the farm's owners. Rocky and Ginger lead their fellow chickens in a great escape from the murderous farmers. Will they succeed? Overall it was a good flick. The animation is good,the story is good and the voice acting was good too."
Sing 2 (2021),Perfect for performing arts heart girlies. and boys,"100/10! This is definitely a movie I've been needing to start the year! I was looking for a happy movie and scrolled up to this one. I was planning on just watching the first few minutes, but then got hooked up and continued watching. Wow, this is really perfect for theater or performing arts enthusiasts out there. It showcases what actually happens when preparing for a show and the process. I am speechless. I think I want a performing artist guy now after I've watched the monkey guy perform. He's totally my crush now; I love his voice. I kept crying while watching the show because of how amazing their talent is and how I would love watching it live in real life. I love this movie. To more watching theater shows in 2024! Btw, Ms. Crawly is the best when keeping in charge!"
Sing 2 (2021),A grander production,"An excellent sequel that only builds on the fantastic and fun dynamics that children love that were founded in the first film. The songs continue to be the perfect blend between the old and the modern, therefore meaning that they're is something for everyone in this film. The colours in this instalment of the Sing franchise (which this is very quickly becoming) is even more vibrant than the last one, with the scale that they character put their final show in if much grander and there is actual threat in this picture that comes in the form of a domineering media mogul; he tries to throw Buster off the building."
Sing 2 (2021),Not going to lie - I DID NOT expect that one,"""Sing 2"" continues the endearing journey of Buster Moon and his troupe of talented performers as they strive to make it big in the world of showbiz. Illumination Entertainment's sequel brings forth a vibrant and captivating spectacle that appeals to both young audiences and the young at heart. The animation in ""Sing 2"" is a visual marvel, exhibiting intricate details that elevate the characters' expressions and movements, immersing the audience in a vibrant world. The attention to detail is evident, creating a captivating experience for viewers. The heart of the film lies in its characters and their unwavering determination to achieve their dreams. The story is a delightful exploration of perseverance, resilience, and the importance of embracing one's individuality. It resonates deeply, delivering valuable messages without losing its entertaining charm. The soundtrack is an absolute highlight, featuring an array of catchy tunes and breathtaking musical performances that infuse the film with energy and emotion. Each song complements the narrative, adding depth and enhancing the overall storytelling experience. Moreover, the introduction of new characters adds layers to the storyline, bringing fresh dynamics and diverse personalities into the mix. These additions inject renewed enthusiasm into the narrative, contributing to the film's overall appeal. In essence, ""Sing 2"" is a well-crafted sequel that successfully builds upon the foundation of its predecessor. It seamlessly combines stunning animation, an engaging storyline, and a stellar soundtrack to deliver a wholesome and entertaining cinematic experience that resonates with audiences of all ages."
Sing 2 (2021),A masterful sequel that is at the level of its predecessor,"The glorious sequel to Sing takes our beloved characters to another level, leaving the theater and venturing into show business on the big stage. The story is almost like the first film, but it is at a higher level seeing how the characters must adapt to a new environment. The soundtrack doesn't have as many familiar songs as the first film, but it's still one of the best things about Sing. Music continues to have great relevance in this universe, being an important element for the stage. The characters must face more difficult challenges such as Buster trying to please mobster Jimmy Crystal or disappoint Rosita, Ash trying to convince Clay Calloway to return to the stage, Johnny trying to be an acrobat dancer and Meena meeting love. Although it was a shame that Mike the mouse didn't return, it didn't affect the magnificence of this movie. This film reflects both the characters and the essence of its predecessor, being a worthy sequel with wonderful animation and amazing sequences. Sing 2 is an excellent sequel and a work of art both visually and aurally. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."
Sing 2 (2021),"Bigger Stage, Brighter Lights","The original crew from the first movie pack up and try to impress in the big city, which is their version of Las Vegas. It's a bit more cut throat then they're use to and Buster Moon may have bitten off more than he can chew. The sequel is just as charming, and the music is just as good. Hard to say which one I enjoyed more, because both are very well done and on par with each other. Of course having the talents of Bono, Halsey, and Pharrell doesn't hurt one bit. As an adult it's still very entertaining to watch. I mean, who doesn't love a well done talking animal movie with amazing animation and great music? I suspect only a few."
Sing 2 (2021),Great but we just watched the original idea from 90s,"This is great and wonderful but there's a huge caveat: it's a total plot rip from the 1997 WB animation Cats Don't Dance with Scott Bakula. What's crazy is a movie as good as the aforementioned movie is not as well known as you'd think but maybe it is it's just we had not ever seen it before until 26 years later, that's bonkers if you ask me. We're not saying anything negative about either movie I just wish we had seen the WB movie before this Illumination animation. Whatever hope you all get a chance to watch and compare the two movies and enjoy both as much as we have. There are a lot of remakes so it's not a new thing."
Sing 2 (2021),Busters back,I enjoyed the original sing. It was something new having animals audition for a singing competition and new talent. Now buster is back along with his crew as they host a show that sees a TV talent scout call them not good enough. This is the final straw for him so he takes his friends on a roadtrip to a las Vegas looking city to prove that they are good enough to a harsh Simon cowle type and his posh daughter porsha. Porsha was a good character so was the cute cat. I liked the edition of the new characters and watching busters lie get bigger makes you wonder what will happen. Overall I really enjoyed this and thought it was a worthy sequel.
Sing 2 (2021),Wow,"It's really hard for me to get into an animated movie most of the time I fall asleep, get bored, and just quit watching but not this one let's face it soundtrack sold it, and the actors who are voicing were so good you didn't necessarily recognize them in their human forms, and the characters just came to life the story, the plot although cliched and predictable was good, and Kept the story moving, if not full of surprises there was still enough interest in the characters to watch the outcome unfold. So this was enjoyable all the way around and had a good message about following your dreams, and being willing to keep trying even when things don't appear to be working out."
Sing 2 (2021),Matthew isn't Australian,"Couldn't they have gotten Larry the Cable Guy instead? I'm disappointed,
so much processing power...
so many colorful characters,
it all comes down to CV padding for the rich and famous. Why dear Jeabus why
do people who have filled screens with film after film of their presence,
need to get into voice-over acting (or voice over-acting)? 1. Buster Moon is a Koala
Koalas are Australian
even if he grew up in San Fran,
why does he sound liquored on every line? Rich Hall jokes about how Tom Cruise films pretty much ran the same script & just changed the scenery
Well, the award for modern day substitute goes to..."
Sing 2 (2021),Great fun film but one rockstar drawback,"I was really surprised by the first film. Especially as a lifelong music snob (in recovery). It really helped me just enjoy pop music again. Sing 2 is impossibly, better. Just better songs, more heart, and some brilliant jokes that go over the heads of kids so keep the adults happy too. The night cleaners alone are worth the price of viewing. Johnny again is brilliant and Miss Crawley almost steals the show. Porsha has a brilliant little scene that is a tribute to Lina Lamont in Singin in the Rain. Or at least I assume it is. I like the premise of Clay Calloway, but oh man I had to knock one star off for Bonos voicing. Bloody awful. But that's the price you pay I guess for being allowed to use some of U2's songs. Even though the U2-by-numbers Your Song Saved My Life is abysmal, it also manages to fit and work. Great viewing, the moan about Bono is a minor whinge to be honest, and Miss Crawley singing along to System of a Down, is priceless."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),"A Halloween-loving dude knows about Christmas for the first time, but it's a Tim Burton movie","The Nightmare Before Christmas uses stop-motion as a tool to tell a fantastic story that could only be conceived in Tim Burton's mind. The premise is simple, a Halloween-loving man (?) discovers Christmas for the first time and falls in love with it, to the point he convinces everyone in town - who don't know what Christmas is either - to celebrate it together. However, as someone who only knows Halloween, his idea of Christmas doesn't align with what Christmas really is. The story is told through a set of musical numbers that usually describe the emotional state of Jack Skellington, but also cover other characters like Sally and the rest of the town. The film basically tells us what would happen if Halloween and Christmas collided. It's a fascinating tale that could only be conceived by Tim Burton."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Festive Fright Night...,"Jack Skellington is fed up with his lot, all the ghoulishness, the gothic rot and grot, so he's left with a big frown, and found the door to Christmas Town, now he's scheming and conniving a new plot. To begin, he's taken Santa from his sleigh, this is now to be a somewhat darker day, where the gifts won't bring a smile, it's a chocolate log defile, gifts of corpses, frogs and spiders left for play. Ooogie Boogie takes the chance to muscle in, a sack that's full of bugs and evil grin, will this nightmare ever end, can the tormenting be stemmed, or will Jack reverse decay and save the day. ... or is the nightmare here stay!"
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Except for it's technical merits. This is hardly a kids movie.,"1993 what in the hell were they thinking. Clearly not a Christmas movie. Therefore it's a horrifical horror movie. Keep the under 10 kids far away... Beetlejuce is hilarious. This movie downright depressing. I need some Frozen to cheer me up. If you are suffering from depression do not watch this movie. Glad it took me 30 years (Disney Insider so $35 bd was free) to watch it , Glad I got it free. Totally pointless film. Glad the girl got her man but hey Santa you could made her seamless. Doubt I'll play this nightmare again. I suggest you watch this in October because it's a horror movie and keep the kids away as this is more like Sleepy Hollow and I rather like the latter. Quality: 6/10 (technical merits only)
Entertainment: 1/10
Re-Playable: 1/10."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Tim Burton's best movie ever,"Even though Tim Burton did not direct this film, it is impossible not to think that The Nightmare Before Christmas is his best work. This is a film with a very original idea that has all the elements that characterize Tim Burton's vision. It is a fantastic story with terrifying and charming elements at the same time. The clash between two festive dates that are very different because of how terrifying one is and how joyful the other is. The characters are quite a peculiarity and the one who steals the entire film is definitely Jack. The inhabitants of Halloween Town have all the elements of a Halloween party and Jack is a clear variant of the legendary Jack O' Lantern. Here Jack feels tired of doing the same thing every year and decides to make a change in his routine, trying to spread Christmas cheer to find a new purpose, but without taking into account the imbalance that he can cause. Another character that is also worthy of praise is Sally who is definitely the voice of reason and the love she feels for Jack makes her care about him. The characters are as quirky and unusual in personality and design as they always should be in a Tim Burton story. The stop-motion animation helps a lot with the strangeness that the characters have and that is why it is still something very admirable to see in this film. The production design and art are faithful to Tim Burton's vision in many ways. This is due to his strong participation in the production. The soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman is also another admirable element of the film. The songs are unforgettable and have become somewhat iconic for the Halloween and Christmas seasons. It is ironic that Henry Selick has been overshadowed, since he has been in charge of directing and has done a good job, not forgetting to mention that this was his first feature film. His participation was also important and this experience was what led him to make Coraline years later. It is really curious that this has been a case in which a director has been able to create his greatest masterpiece without the need to direct and only taking care of the rest of the production. All the technical details have Tim Burton's vision and essence, as does the story he created. The Nightmare Before Christmas is definitely the best film in Tim Burton's filmography, one of the best animated films in history and a wonderful classic to enjoy at Halloween and Christmas. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Christmas Evel,"Tim Burton wrote and co-produced this short, musical, stop-animation feature, (it was directed by Henry Slick, but has Burton's fingerprins all over it)) as an antidote to other cuddly seasonal features which are available, cleverly conflating probably his own favourite holiday season Halloween with everybody else's, Christmas. The story's quite simple and straightforward, Halloween Jack (wasn't that a line in a Bowie song?) Skellington (love that spelling!) organises Halloween for his fellow town residents but has lately become bored in the process. To rejuvenate himself, he decides to borrow a few tricks from neighbouring Christmas Town where he thinks a little mix-and-match of the two holidays might succeed. It does seem a bit like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and his adoring girlfriend Sally Finkelstein, who is forever trying to escape the attentions of her creator, Dr Finkelstein, tries to tell him so, but headstrong Jack carries on regardless, his master stroke, or so he thinks, being to kidnap Sandy Claws (his spelling), take his place and dispense much less wholesome toys to all the nice boys and girls. Actually in this day and age, I'm not sure old Jack wasn't onto something considering some of the videogames kids play today. Anyway, at least in 1993, he gets it wrong, spoiling every youngster's Christmas morning and at the same time jeopardising Santa himself who he's left in the care of the bad old Boogie Man. Who knows though, maybe Sally can literally pull herself together and help Jack to save the day... For me, the most disappointing feature of the movie was the rather lukewarm soundtrack provided by Danny Elfman. None of the songs stay in the memory although I will concede they do help the story along. I liked two sequences in particular, Jack's disastrous delivery of the kiddies' gifts and the showdown with the Boogie Man. The animation is excellent throughout, recalling for me anyway ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Yellow Submarine"" and even ""H. R. Pufnstuf"". Perhaps I'd have liked a few more good jokes in the dialogue and a little bit darker treatment in the narrative, but on the whole, I'll take Burton's, let's call it a grey Christmas, over ""The Snowman"" any old Christmas Day."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Just don't get the Christmas Feeling!,Not for me or my wife and 12 year old daughter. My Daughter's thoughts were that she expected so much more as it had been recommended and lauded by so many but was left disappointed as the premise was interesting but was ruined by an over abundance of singing. My own thoughts were that the whole Halloweeners trying to understand xmas became pretty repetitive and I lost my interest quite easily as it felt like the same stuff repeated for 73 minutes. It wasnt that Seems we might be being a little petty. But it just didn't feel like a Christmas movie and certainly didn't evoke the same nostalgic feelings that numerous other xmas movies do. Maybe We are just traditionalists . Won't be added to our Christmas Watchlist.
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),The Nightmare Before Christmas,"This film has a cult following and people really seem to like it but I have never been a huge fan of it. It just does not do it for me. I wish I cld explain why but I can't. Its an ok story, but not the best. Tim Burton is a very talented director, so I do not know why I do not care for the film but I just have never loved it. It's just ok. Nothing more to say about it. It is always included with holiday films but it's just an ok film. It is not great it's just a ok topic. I would recommend if you are a Tim Burton fan and have never seen this film otherwise skip it so many better holiday movies out there."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Gothic stop-motion masterpiece: an essential holiday film,"An animated Disney production from 1993 directed by Henry Selick (Coraline, Wendell & Wild), The Nightmare Before Christmas follows ""Pumpkin King"" Jack Skellington's doomed adventures from Halloween Town to Christmas Town and back again. Based on a story and characters by Tim Burton, the film is a stop-motion animated musical featuring the singing voice of Danny Elfman, who also wrote the score. While it wasn't a huge hit initially, it soon achieved cult classic status and is seen, to this day, as one of the best animated features of all time. Two holidays are cleverly intertwined here as Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon), a Halloween hero, grows tired of entertaining his usual ghoulish crowd, delivering the same spooky thrills year after year. When he discovers a place called Christmas Town, he becomes enamored with the entire concept and so decides to... take it for himself. A loving yet twisted pastiche of classic Rankin/Bass specials, as well as Dr Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas and other classic cartoons, The Nightmare Before Christmas lures you in quick with its delightfully macabre ""This Is Halloween"" tune and it never lets go as Danny Elfman offers catchy song after catchy song, making the most of each one in his own unique style. This may have been Tim Burton's idea, and it may be Henry Selick's masterpiece, but it is, first and foremost, Elfman's baby: his work here is nothing short of genius and deserved a lot more recognition back in the day. From the lonely ""Jack's Lament"" to the bombastic ""What's This?"", the beautiful ""Sally's Song"", the playful ""Making Christmas"" and the devilish ""Oogie Boogie's Song"", the movie never missteps and is singalong-worthy from start to finish. The animation here is, frankly, incredible. This is stop-motion at its best with every shot carefully composed, Tim Burton's art style perfectly captured and the emotions of all these bizarre characters conveyed with great care. The character design is unique, the settings are appropriately gothic and countless inventive techniques are used here to make the animation flow in harmony with the music. The film looks gorgeous, of course, but it also has a timeless, nostalgic feel that'll make you want to watch it for both aforementioned holidays every single year. We care about these characters, feel for them, and can't wait to see them naively attempt the impossible in true Halloween Town style! Few animated films manage to get everything right: The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those rarities. Hugely entertaining, a visual treat, a truly fantastic musical and, despite its frightening look, very very funny, not to mention filled with the magic that many Christmas movies promise but so often fail to materialize. It's one hell of a sleigh ride and viewers of all ages should get a big kick out of it. Essential holiday romp."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Easily one of the best Halloween movies,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is THE movie that combines two holidays. Halloween and Christmas are the best holidays of the year (in my opinion at least). This movie combines those two holidays in one. It is way more Halloween than Christmas, with the main characters literally being from a place called Halloween Town. The story revolves around the Pumpkin King Jack getting tired of doing Halloween year after year, which leads him to Christmas. I feel Jack is pretty relatable. There have been a time where I was tired of focusing on one thing all the time. I have recovered from that but still. I feel like the villain should be in the movie a little more. Besides that, I don't really have any complaints."
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993),Unique,"It's irrefutable that this film is already cult and has been a great influence on many people. Tim Burton's imagery is now recognizable worldwide and it all begins here, with the film directed by Henry Selick. The most notable thing, consequently, is the production design. The characters, the sets, the decoration... absolutely everything has Burton's trademark, which, helped with the practical effects of stop motion, gives us a beautiful visual spectacle. It's without a doubt the most notable. Now, moving on to other technicalities, the script is somewhat bland, cumbersome and boring. The edition tends to be repetitive and slow, for an animated musical. Everything has a clear justification, obviously, but even so, they are, in my opinion, negative points. As a side point, between us... was it necessary for it to be a musical? Anyway... In short, the film can be entertaining for those who like Burton's dark and depressive style, for lovers of stop motion and for those looking for something different, because without a doubt, they will find it here."
Elemental (2023),Sweet and clever,"How this sweet little movie failed is beyond me the animation is clever the story is good the characters are well realised it should have been a massive hit but it was killed by sourpuss critics on the Internet before it even started. Essentially it's a modern take on the Romeo and Juliette trope a boy and girl from drastically different backgrounds fall in love to the chagrin of their parents, in this case it's a fire girl and a water boy. Set in Element city a place where diverse cultures live together in a melting pot society it demonstrates how we can all rub along together even though we have our differences. Nice sweet movie great for children, Pixar at their best."
Elemental (2023),Loved this movie!,"Elemental is one of my favorite animated films. To be honest, when I first heard about a girl of fire and a water boy falling in love in an elemental city, I thought this would be cringe, predictable, weird, and so not funny. But then I decided to give it a try and wow, I was wrong! It's such a cute 'opposites attract' love story. The dialogue is so funny and the animation is just so beautiful. I love the characters and just watching them fall in love made me so happy. I liked the ending and being able to watch their journey was very satisfying. There are a lot of themes shown, such as racism, immigration, and parental expectations. In the end, Elemental makes a great movie night and I enjoyed it a lot. This will surprise you in a pleasant way and bring a smile to your face."
Elemental (2023),10/10,"HOT TAKE: Elemental is amazing. Yes, pun intended but I'm so serious here, folks; this was very done and I urge you to give it a fair shot. Elemental is a modern yet fantastical odyssey of romance and self-realization clashing with the weight of ethnic and generational expectations. A colorful and cultural onslaught of imagination, relatability and sentiment, tailored by two endearing leads with irresistible chemistry. I'm usually not one for romcoms but if the leads are engaging enough, then I'm sold. Ember and Wade - voiced by fresh talent Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie, respectively - share a captivating journey together, one that isn't just focused on love but puts their humanity in a binding spotlight. Their relationship flows oh-so naturally and is 10x more enchanting than any prince and princess story. You know that scene from WALL-E where the robots dance outside the spaceship? Almost the entirety of Elemental follows that one gorgeous sequence's beat and it's utterly charming. The animation is quite stunning to behold; fluid, expressive and diverse. I can tell Pixar had so much fun with it while pushing the envelope; such a delight to watch. The world drips with inventiveness and attention to detail; I wouldn't pass on living in Element City. I can't leave out Thomas Newman's music, too. This is the composer's fourth collaboration with Pixar (the first since Finding Dory) and his score doesn't disappoint; lovely, often hypnotizing, and always hits the right notes. Elemental is one of the most soulful and compassionate pictures to come out of Pixar in recent years and it's getting such a bum rap for no good reason. Look, it may seem familiar on the surface but - as expected from the studio that pioneered the art form and tells personal stories - Elemental is built from real relationships and social conflicts and has moving answers to questions on affection, immigration, pressure, sacrifice, and free will. Prepare for some sniffles and tears. I felt the love that was put into it every second and that standing ovation at Cannes was well-earned. Congrats, Peter Sohn. Thanks for telling your story."
Elemental (2023),Creative with a romantic cultural themed story,4 out of 5 stars. Elemental is a good romantic comedy family pixar film that is fun and creative with having a world built with characters that are elements. Certain elements clash with each other and has a story about how two elements Wade and Ember who are fire and water. Ember is from a family immigrant whos father wants her to follow under his footstep on owning the family shop. Wade is a water inspector who fails her shop which Ember tries to convince him to let it go. The opposites attract. They become close and she also realizes that there is more in the world about following her dreams. It is fun. Great visuals and animation. The plot is good. The film may not have any memorable characters and humor. It is still a good worthy pixar film that has a story and visuals thats worth checking out.
Elemental (2023),This is not a bad movie,"Watched this with a group of children from my school on a Christmas treat. The whole cohort sat transfixed and from that point onwards this has become a major discussion point in our classroom. It's beautifully filmed, lovingly delivered and develops the story well as you move along. Yes we have seen this before - but as there are only five or six actual stories in the world that's a 'meh' argument. This isn't a 'flop' from Pixar it's a reimagining which was beautifully done. Ignore the haters - this is a film to be experienced and enjoyed and will allow each person to take away from it what they need from their perspective... well done Pixar."
Elemental (2023),"Not the best Pixar movie, but certainly not the worst","I saw this film this summer, hearing nothing except that it bombed at the box office and it was panned by audiences and critics. Having only had heard bad news about this, I went in with low expectations, and walked out satisfied. PLOT: The movie is about two Fire elements immigrating from Fireland, Bernie and Cinder Lumen, who immigrate to Element City. The other elements, earth, water, and air, especially water, are extremely biased against them because fire can put out water. They start a new life with their daughter Ember in a small little neighborhood shop called The Fireplace, which Ember will take over one day. Ember has a bit of a temper. She loses her temper one day in the shop and causes a pipe to burst and a water guy named Wade Ripple falls through the pipe into the shop. Wade is a inspector in Element City, and he writes Ember some citations because her father's shop isn't up to code. The citations could shut the shop down. Ember chases Wade through the city to stop him, but is too late and he sends the tickets. Ember and Wade have to team up to fix a broken door in a culvert to cancel the tickets and save the shop, and fall in love as they spend more time together and get to know each other. Overall, the plot is very well executed, and relatively simple in concept. Other than some filler here and there, not a lot of time is wasted. CHARACTERS: Ember is a excellent protagonist. Wade is kind of a crybaby, but not annoying. Almost every character is fun and has a reason to be there. Except Clod, the little earth kid. I don't understand why the marketing team thought he would be so popular, but he's not. He's just annoying and I cringe every time he shows up. WRITING: The screenplay is very strong and well-written. Every scene has a purpose in Ember and Wade's story. Sometimes the writing can be a little clunky. Overall, a very good script. Overall, a very solid story populated with memorable, interesting characters in a colorful, fun world. Perfect for a movie night. 9/10 stars. I would recommend."
Elemental (2023),A success for the family,"Watched it with the 9 year-old at his request, knowing little about the film. Most of the metaphors about migration, starting over in a new country with a different culture, passed him by, but this is something my husband and I have experienced and it touched me. He did ask questions and we talked a little about it, which is just what we want with a children's movie: opening up conversations without being traumatic. He was thrilled and touched by the love story, and so was I. A good time, for sure, and we both finished the movie with a warm heart. Recommend watching with kids from 7 or 8 upwards, littlest ones might be engaged by the beautiful visuals but might lose interest."
Elemental (2023),Elemental is Pixar's Murkiest film yet. But it's also really beautiful and emotionally compelling.,"I love this movie. The world building is so messy, and maybe it's a bit quaint in terms of storytelling, as well as the story itself not being quite strong or cohesive, but I don't care, this is Pixars most underrated film. The characters are endearing. I love ember. Her arc is so strong and the bond between her and her father was compelling. Wade was also pretty cool, and I enjoyed seeing these two together, as they had great chemistry and very solid emotional moments. The animation was gorgeous, with so many colors, and beautiful character designs. The score by Thomas Newman was gorgeous as well, and I love Lauv's song ""Steal The Show."" The film was funny, but honestly that's another issue, as the movie isn't quite as funny as it thinks it is. Voice acting was really good and I think everyone should be proud of the work they put it in. This movie obviously came from a place of passion and honestly, it's so good. Flawed sure, but it's no doubt one of Pixar's hidden Gems. A little bit of old Disney/Pixar was brought back. Not a ton, but enough."
Elemental (2023),I can't stop watching!!,"Phenomenal story line, and animation. This film was thought out so well, I could barely look away to wipe my tears. Recommend for all ages, this is not just a family film! This is now one of my favorites of all time. This film can resonate with millions for a multitude of various reasons, family origin, romance chasers, and even just as simple as a background film for your kids during dinner. I can't recommend this to be added to your watch & rewatch list enough. You won't be able to tear away your attention! Peter Sohn did a such an impeccable job writing & directing; I cried during & again after I learned his parents passed during the making of this film."
Elemental (2023),Saved thanks to the music,"Other the main characters being earth elements, which is pretty unique, the story is very much one that has been told 1000 times. A child of immigrants grows up in a family that expects the child to take over their family business. The child (Ember) grows up with intent of running the family business, so as to not disappoint their parents. The whole time, the child is unhappy because they don't take the time to do things for themselves or do what makes them happy. Enter the lovable free spirit (Wade). He comes from a family who follows their passions but who have also suffered a tragedy (death of Wade's father). The child is initially annoyed by this free spirit but also is intrigued by them. Just to spice things up, the child of immigrants and the free spirit come from completely different backgrounds. The child of the immigrant, at the urging of the free spirit, decides to finally tell her immigrant parents that she wants to follow her passion and doesn't want to run the family business after all, expecting the parents to be angry. Surprise! They aren't angry and support her decision. The free spirit and the child of immigrants fall in love, and they live happily ever after. I'll admit that I went into this with super low expectations. Pixar has been a little hit or miss of late. I didn't hate this movie, but it really feels like the days of Pixar being the standard for animated movies is over. The story is so run of the mill and if it wasn't for the beautiful score by Thomas Newman, I would have given this a much lower rating. Thomas Newman really knows how to compose music that pulls at your heart strings. I'll also say that the voice performances were all very good and of course the animation is stunning. It's just a shame that the story wasn't better."
Sing (2016),Harmony Hits the Stage: 'Sing' Takes Center Spotlight in Musical Delight!,"Illumination Entertainment has made a name for itself as a reliable provider of quality family entertainment since the release of Despicable Me. Although Sing is Illumination's debut musical, it shares many similarities with the company's other productions. A wonderful time is had by all, even though the star-studded cast and equally star-studded song catalogue don't go very deep. Naturally, though, the entire plot serves as a vehicle for the music. From Van Halen to Beyoncé, the production seems to have spent no money at all obtaining the rights to a long and diverse range of songs. Some become the focal point of elaborate musical pieces, while others are only included in the soundtrack."
Sing (2016),Illumination's great musical work,"The creators of Despicable Me present an original animated film that revives the magic of musicals. This film is a masterful work that also has an excellent soundtrack made of a very good choice of popular songs from different eras. This story is built through the lives of different characters with a common goal, which is stardom in the world of music. We have the rogue Koala Buster Moon played by the great Matthew McConaughey, who always remains optimistic trying to do the impossible to take his theater to the top. The little pig Rosita who is a responsible mother with a big dream. She is accompanied by the charismatic Gunter voiced by Nick Kroll. Ambitious mouse Mike, played by Seth MacFarlane, who has an excellent jazz voice. The punk porcupine Ash who is voiced by the great Scarlett Johansson, and is one of the best characters in the movie. Taron Egerton playing the gorilla Johnny who doesn't want to be a criminal like his father. Lastly we have Tori Kelly as Meena, the shy elephant whose opportunity to be a singer is limited by her shyness. The film offers magnificent musical moments with excellent animation that can be admired on an artistic and visual level. Sing is one of Illumination's best films and an excellent animated film that pays tribute to the world of music in a worthy way. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."
Sing (2016),I rather sing,"After the success of both Minions and Despicable Me movies it is time to sing. A koala runs a show with animals singing human hit songs, as there is a mix of chases but it gets ruined but he and his friends restores it and opens up for a sequel in 2021. There is something for all here like furries, hits of all genres, nice CGI work, action, out of context and humor. But, it has a semiudark ending as the two mice are not in the sequels after being chased by the bear gang. Illumination do not fail to entertain, Oscar or Golden Globes or not just watch these movies for fun and I think Sing 2 was another hit so Sing 3 could be possible."
Sing (2016),Fun And Great Animal And Musical Animated Film,"This is a sensational animated film for all viewers to watch and really enjoy. The crew did a great job in creating this animated film. All the music and songs were exceptional and splendid. The storyline was terrific and harmonious. The cast selection was absolutely excellent and huge. They strongly committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. This animated film reveals to viewers there is no shame in anyone in revealing who you truly are in a person. If anyone has a story or something to show, they are allowed to that. The main reason that I became a writer is to tell my own story and be heard. This is a great animated film for everyone to watch."
Sing (2016),Amazing,"When I started watching it i wasn't supposed that it'll hit me like that, I was thinking that it's gonna be a normal cartoon movie,but it gave me goosebumps many times, and the song used in the movie and the characters who sang those songs was so amazing The movie doesn't disappoint you anywhere, all have to say that I laughed i cried i surprised and I got excited
while watching it. The characters and their nature, backstory are just wow, this is a movie that won't let you to forget it
All characters was amazing but , 'moon'hit me hard, his coming timing
And the way that how he does it works was lit , it really made me cry when his theatre got destroyed, and i also cried when he rebuilt his theatre Gotta say that,you should watch it."
Sing (2016),"Terrible music, not a single risk taken.","Prepare to hear all your least favourite and played-to-death pop songs with even MORE autotune than ever before. The movie refuses to even take a risk of allowing singing voices to be even a single cent out of tune, and it loses all soul. That's the biggest crime, this movie is absolutely devoid of soul. John C. Reilly is in this, ""Walk Hard"" was one of the greatest musical comedies of all time with some truly well-written original music, this is the complete antithesis of that. No laughs, nothing memorable, no new ground, just an auto-generated, auto-corrected, useless, stinking waste of time for everyone."
Sing (2016),As if your life depended on it,"No pun intended - I mean animals needing money? Also the inciting incident being quite ... well you have to suspend your disbelief to be able to go on watching. Ans to add to that: you have to dig and like Musicals to a degree .. a lot of songs (and dance numbers) thrown your way during the run time of the movie. I wouldn't have thought this would spawn a sequel, but it was quite succesful - and I finally was able to watch both movies the other day. That all being said, this is quite interesting and if you don't have issues with animals being ... well humanized (though none of them even thinks about selling their organs to get out of their financial issues ... probably wouldn't get much for them anyway) ... you can watch this and have fun with it. Even more so with the voice talent at hand ... alright alright alright ... quite fast paced ... better shape up ... yes looks like this is the one that you want ... ooh ooh ooh (no pun intended)"
Sing (2016),If ever a film was aptly titled...,"A very enjoyable and charming movie musical featuring tons of covers, an electric cast of animals and a good dose of wit along the way. Definitely a family movie I can recommend. My favourite character is Mike the Mouse, mainly because of his hilariously self-centred personality but also because he has the most interesting arc in terms of character development. The formula is somewhat familiar, but you do get to care about these crooning beasts and if the big climax doesn't have you cheering to the rafters, you may very well have no heart. A well-earned 7/10 from me. About to watch the sequel... be back soon!"
Sing (2016),Super entertaining !,"Delightful animated movie that will have you singing and dancing along with its charming characters and catchy tunes. The story is set in a bustling city populated by anthropomorphic animals, each with their dreams and aspirations. Buster Moon, an enthusiastic koala with a passion for theater, runs a once-grand but now struggling theater. He's determined to bring back its former glory, but the theater is facing financial difficulties. In a stroke of inspiration, Buster decides to organize a singing competition called ""Singing Sensation"" to attract a large audience and save the theater from foreclosure. However, a small mishap results in the prize money being mistakenly advertised as way more than what Buster can actually afford. Despite the mix-up, a diverse group of talented animals auditions for the competition, each with their unique backgrounds and dreams. Among them are Rosita, an overworked and underappreciated mother of 25 piglets; Johnny, a gorilla torn between his passion for singing and his family's criminal activities; Ash, a rebellious teenage porcupine with a rocky relationship with her boyfriend; Meena, a shy and timid elephant with a powerful voice; and Mike, a smooth-talking mouse with big dreams. As the auditions unfold and rehearsals begin, the contestants face various personal challenges and setbacks. Buster also faces mounting pressure to find a way to raise the prize money before the truth is revealed. Despite the obstacles, the contestants work hard and support each other, forming unexpected friendships and discovering their true passions along the way. As the day of the big show approaches, excitement builds, and the theater comes alive with anticipation. The grand finale of ""Singing Sensation"" is a heartwarming and spectacular event that showcases the talents of the lovable characters. Each contestant gives their all, but a series of mishaps and unexpected events threaten to derail the show. In a touching and uplifting climax, the characters come together to save the day, proving that true success is not measured solely by fame or fortune, but by the joy of pursuing one's passion and the support of friends and loved ones. ""SIng"" is a feel-good movie that celebrates the power of music, the importance of chasing dreams, and the strength of community. With its lovable characters, humorous moments, and a fantastic soundtrack featuring popular songs, ""Sing"" is a heartwarming and entertaining film that will leave you with a smile on your face and a song in your heart."
Sing (2016),Diary of a Charlatan,"I saw the original Sing not long after it came out. To me it was Illumination's best effort, not great but avoiding many of the pitfalls of their other movies. I didn't give it much of a critical eye but did enjoy rooting for the characters to achieve their goals, and even gave Buster a free pass for his bankrupt morals. Sing 2 came years later and I wasn't quite as enamored with the sequel despite of it going bigger and louder, and adding some great new characters (what they did to Jimmy Crystal was criminal, he deserves better). I appreciate the generally lowkey character moments and backstories that the sequel sort of abandoned, but the truth for both movies is that Buster Moon is the biggest thorn in this franchise's side. But things started to fall in place for me once I came to accept a theory that isn't wholly original but was solidified by Buster's behavior in the sequel: Buster Moon is a villain protagonist. Sing is the story of a struggling theater producer and a menagerie of characters that find salvation to their personal struggles through the power of song. Buster Moon finds himself in dire financial straits after a long string of flops at his theater scares his benefactors into pulling out. With the bank on the verge of seizing his crumbling theater, Buster cooks up a last-ditch scheme to save it: put on a singing competition. We are then introduced to a group of hopefuls: Johnny the gorilla is a sensitive soul with a gangster father pulling him into a life of crime, but all he wants to do is sing. Rosita the pig is a housewife that gave up her dream to raise her family, an arc that might be slightly undercut by the fact that she has, no joke, twenty-five kids. Ash the porcupine must find a way to express her true self after decoupling from her unfaithful, gaslighting boyfriend Lance. Meena the elephant has a booming voice but is deeply shy and too afraid to perform when it matters. Mike the mouse is the designated jerk with a velvet voice, a schemer that must discover if singing is his true calling. Gunter the pig talks in a funny voice and dabbles in comic relief. Yeah, that one got the short end of the stick, but at least he has some moments of emotional intelligence. Besides the characters' individual struggles, the main conflict arises when the $1000 prize is misprinted as $100k by Buster's bumbling assistant Ms. Crawly. Buster then engages in a house of cards scheme by trying to woo his best friend's rich grandmother, theater legend Nana Noodleman, into fronting the prize money. Along the way, Buster commits a litany of petty crimes and shows a strong aversion to telling the truth before it all blows up in his face in spectacular fashion. Sing doesn't particularly excel at anything, but it is a comfy movie. The story is unambitious but humble and feels like there was a passion for old Hollywood movies about putting on a show to save a theater or something like that. The music selection is wide and definitely feels like it was trying to appeal to more than just kids. Character designs aren't great, with almost random proportions that make the characters feel like they were designed for a different medium before being haphazardly slapped into a CG feature without much grace or care. Zootopia is much better about designing anthropomorphic animal characters, with a world built to fit them. Sing's world is literally just our world with no regard for the wide amount of shapes and sizes for its population. I'm not sure if this generic setting is a result of Illumination's famously restrained budgets or a complete lack of desire from the creative team to do any world building. The movie flops a bit when it comes to how non-committal it is to its narratives and character arcs. Sing has what I call ""passable in the moment"" writing: It's mostly working when you watch it, but if you think about anything for more than 5 seconds, it just doesn't make any sense. The conflict between Johnny and his dad is the most popular arc in the movie and a prime example. When Johnny's dad rejects him for singing, there's no given reason behind his actions. He just does. And when they reconcile, it comes off as a bit absurd, because why was he against his son singing in the first place? Nobody knows! This really extends to just about anything resembling conflict in this movie. Most problems just... work themselves out. Meena's shy until she isn't. The plot doesn't explore why she's shy or some plan to overcome it... people just tell her to stop being shy until she isn't, then everything works itself out. This movie's threadbare theme of believing in yourself is quite literal, because at no point do any of these characters engage in hard work or intelligent thought when it comes to problem solving. They believe, and then everything just works out. Sing's biggest weakness is its protagonist. Buster Moon exists in a space of sentimentality and fluff, where morals sorta do but really don't matter. I think protagonists should have flaws, especially in kid-friendly material, because those characters make mistakes, learn from them, and grow into better people. The problem here is that Sing wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to Buster. He does unequivocally terrible things that hurts other characters but never goes through the stage of growth that includes acknowledging what you did wrong, apologizing, making amends, and taking steps to be better - and prospers in spite of this. This isn't a fluke in this movie; Buster's misdeeds continue in Sing 2 when he starts the movie off by defrauding Jimmy Crystal in what was a good faith business deal on Crystal's part. Crystal is one of the few characters to call Buster's bad behavior out and is horribly vilified by the movie in response, despite not doing much of anything villainous for most of the narrative. This is around the time I started to sour on Buster as a character. It feels manipulative that the gorilla disowned by his parent or the elephant struggling with stage fright can't succeed unless the con artist exploiting them does too. A sleazy theater owner taking advantage of a bunch of wide-eyed dreamers would undoubtedly be a villain character in any other story. His happy ending is just given to him on a silver platter - he didn't really earn it, and he learned nothing from the mistakes he made. Not every character needs to be a role model, but Buster is definitely a terrible one. Despite its many warts, I feel like Sing is the blueprint for Illumination to make better movies, because it actually tries when it comes to character and narrative. They... don't seem to be following that blueprint, but with a third Sing movie on the horizon, it's never too late to learn. With all the money they rake in, there's no reason not to try to be better beyond pure hubris."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),"""They look like little Shreks to me.""","FILM: 8/10. As a 43-year-old original fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics, cartoons, and the live-action films from the 90s, my expectations were as low as a pizza in the sewer. Many attempts to recapture the turtle magic had fallen flatter than a deflated pizza crust. However, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and the writers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem pleasantly surprised me, delivering the best TMNT content in decades. Featuring actual teenagers as the voice cast adds a pepperoni twist to the turtles, infusing their characters with the energy and idiocy of adolescence. The tangents and teenage spirals perfectly capture that age, earning a ninja nod of approval. The rest of the cast, a deep roster of talent, brings the characters to life with flair. Ditching the usual focus on the Shredder and the Foot Clan, the film takes a refreshing turn with Ice Cube's Superfly and a rogues' gallery of secondary villains. It's a topping of variety that's been missing in previous TMNT projects. The animation is as unique as a turtle shell, and Mutant Mayhem does for TMNT what Into the Spider-Verse did for Spider-Man, giving it a fresh and visually captivating spin. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score, like the perfect blend of cheese and tomato sauce, hits all the right notes. Their fusion of acoustic and electronic elements creates a varied soundtrack that complements each scene like the perfect pizza pairing. After enduring some disappointing Michael Bay-produced films, this reboot was like a pizza delivery in a half shell, exactly what the TMNT franchise needed. Bring on the sequel, and let the turtles keep kicking shell with their newfound freshness! A turtle power revival that's as satisfying as a slice with all your favorite toppings.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),"Fun flick, but I hope the sequel is better.","The problem with origin super hero movies is they're all the same on the surface, that's why Spider-Man Homecoming skipped Peter Parker's whole origin story because we've heard it a thousand times, but TMNT isn't quite as popular so they had to go over the basics. As a result, the characters and animation are fun, but the story could have been written by an AI. A sequel should take care of that though. In the next movie, we'll have these fun charters already established and the story can go wherever they want to take it, which is exciting! Speaking of the characters, they're super fun and acted by actual teenagers! They're pretty annoying but in a ""teenaged boys having harmless fun"" kinda way which I really vibed with. I appreciate the animation isn't the simple 3D Pixar animation we've been seeing for the past 2 decades, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say I thought this was the same studio that made the Spider-Verse movies, turns out they're entirely different and unrelated. I enjoy unique art styles, and they try to separate themselves from the Spider-verse films, but it's obvious that some studio exec said ""I want a movie like the Spider-Verse movies"" and thus we got TMNT Mutant Mayhem. That's not to say the animation is bad or anything, but to me it felt like the movie didn't have an identity. It didn't help having all the pop music needle drops either. This movie will be incredibly dated in just 10 years with all its modern references, but hey it's fun now and that's all that really matters. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the movie, but don't hold your breath for anything crazy like the Spider-Verse movies this film was so clearly trying to copy."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),"A total disaster, polluting the Turtles for this generation","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful Despite protecting the city from crime, the Turtles, and their master Splinter (Jackie Chan) must live beneath it in the sewers, as the public spurn them because they don't look like them. In the middle of this, the city is under attack from the criminal mastermind, Superfly (Ice Cube), a giant, sludgy bug who's got the local crime monopoly under his control. Cue a run in with cool, streetwise aspiring reporter April O' Neill (Ayo Edibiri), with whom they strike a deal: they'll let her into their world, in return for positive exposure in the social media world April is fluent with. I tend to be fairly loyal, with any franchise with a long established fan base, as it goes through the years, meaning different things to new generations in new incarnations. One that maybe drifted away was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which remained fundamentally aimed at kids, without the dark potential to explore, like with the Batman films. And so Mutant Mayhem, the latest version of the original cartoon, passed me by, especially with 'permanent teenager' Seth Rogan, who I'm no great fan of, being one of the writers and producers. But, I've finally given it a go on streaming...and it's even worse than I thought, for reasons I'd never have thought. Directors Geoff Rowe and Kyle Spears are going with an experimental style with the animation, which may appeal to some, but comes off as crude and garish to those of a certain taste. But what's even worse is how they've mangled the characters and their backstories. Jackie Chan's Splinter has morphed from his original calm, restrained manner, into some funky hipster, who plays them old school hip hop tunes that came out before most of the target demographic were born, and won't remember. To be fair, the Turtles retain their original distinctive characteristics, but what is up with Donatello's voice, sounding like some infant who's just learned to talk?!? No wonder it seems voiceover artist Micah Abbey is the only one too embarrassed to have a publicity headshot. Crucially, though, the plot is threadbare, the humour has far more misses than hits, and the whole thing feels like a hideous mangling of the original version, that hints it may be time for the Turtles to put their weapons back in their holsters. *"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),Just bad,"To start off it was an easy watch for me due to the music as it was clearly compiled by someone who grew up around the same era as me. The art style was really quite nice but for a poster, not for the film. It didn't work and a different style would have been much better. It's not really an all ages thing. It just wasn't suitable for adults. The dialogue was really annoying for anyone age 10+. The script was the same, very immature. I felt like there were lots of nods to different popular things to try and score brownie points with everyone, such as BTS and Attack in Titan. The whole thing was just boring and fell flat. It was quite simply a bit of boring feature length cartoon. Just nothing to like with a kids story that did nothing, kids dialogue that was annoying and a soundtrack and art style that didn't really work. Yet another disappointment. I'm actually getting so disappointed with Hollywood films that are complete rubbish, getting decent reviews that I am probably going to return to not watching films out of the US anymore. They just have no substance and keep getting worse."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),Entertaining but not TMNT,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect watching this movie. First of all I am not a huge fan of the style of animation. So, for me it was a bit of a big strike against. But the biggest strike against it is changing the characters and the backstory. Villains weren't really villains and weren't allowed to shine. It's campy, full of cliches and quite silly. That's the part that works. Voice acting is quite good. There really isn't much for character development. The storyline is overly simplistic. Being, primarily a kids movie, that was expected. Despite all the flaws it is entertaining but it starts from what is the TMNT's."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),whoever wrote this needs to quit,"I grew up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show from the 87, saw all the movies up until this one. I was not impressed with the last 2 remakes but as average as they were at least they didn't make me upset. I don't even know where to start. They changed the origin story which might which could have been okay if it was well-written, but that was not the case. Everything seemed so bland and unbelievable. I almost lost it when there was a scene where Splinter was sitting in a couch scrolling through his cell phone like an old man having nothing else to do. The writers tried so hard to be smart and funny but to me failed at all levels. Most of the jokes didn't land and I couldn't care less or sympathize with most of the characters. This seems like one of those ""modern"" remakes that are so popular these days. I could almost feel Seth Rogen's touch all over the material. I still liked the animation and the voice acting was decent. Other than that it's an empty shell. Even at 100 minutes it felt so long."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is regurgitation served as child's play. I actually feel sick after watching it. No joke.,"Nerd Turtles (2023) is a batch of sensory overload and gross animation. Junk food for the mind. It actually made me feel sick after watching, and I don't know if that's done intentionally. I would have nice things to say about TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, but for whatever reason, it just makes me feel awful discussing the fact that I watched it, so without wasting time, here's a hot take on the movie instead: I'd probably enjoy this movie a lot more if I were a kid, but being honest, I think even the most die-hard Ninja Turtle fans know this movie didn't live up to their expectations. For one, the style is fitting, but it lacks in delivery for a number of reasons. Some of the character designs are freakishly off-putting for some reason. Not the main turtle designs, but a lot of the others. April O'Neil, at many points, had eye problems. (I'm not sure if I'm the only one who noticed that.) Another problem with making a movie in the same vein as Spider-Verse is that, while TMNT: Mutant Mayhem doesn't directly copy the style verbatim, it does strike me as being a little bit low quality for trying to replicate the personality without understanding why the personality of Spider-Verse worked in the first place. Spider-Verse 1 and 2 may have set a high bar for what could be accomplished with visual aesthetics, but they never sacrificed simplicity. On the other hand, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem tries to do it's own thing, but at the expense of battering the Ninja Turtle source material in order to fit in. There were other problems with the animation outside of this, but I'll give the movie a pass in this area. The writing is so generic, it actually makes me want to cry. There could be so much more done with this franchise, and if they do make a sequel, I'm hoping they learn from what stunk about Mutant Mayhem, because a lot of the writing had its high points and a lot more low points. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the premise, and the ideas stick to the wall, but without spoiling anything, it's clear this movie is made to hype up the next movie and not as its own stand-alone film. This is the ""how do you do, fellow kids"" to the Ninja Turtles franchise. I am able to tolerate this movie, I just don't want to think about it anymore. I'll give credit where credit is due and say that it didn't eat me inside, but it just makes me not want to look at another pop culture reference ever again. This movie had too many of those, to which I will add, ""Am I not turtley enough for the turtle club?"" If what I said was hard for you to endure, that's how I felt about this movie. *sigh*"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),"Pretty Good, Made For Kids (As It Should Be)","While I did think this was a pretty good effort on the Turtles, probably the best since the old movies I grew up on. The art style was excellent, very unique. There were parts where it looked almost like claymation mixed with illustration or something. This is the first time I've seen the Turtles treated like actual TEENAGERS. I said so to a couple of people who said ""Didn't they always act like Teenagers?"" to which I say NO. They acted like Surfers. They also made an effort to incorporate some more of the comic/cartoon characters that people are less familiar with, which I thought was nice. The movie was not without flaws. First off, there's no Shredder. I get that he's not the only villain, but I was hoping for some Shredder. The soundtrack was mostly fine, but they repeatedly used the song ""Ante Up"" like it was the theme of the movie and that song very flatly glorifies armed robbery. If you're going to gear your movie towards kids, maybe be a little more conscious of the messages you're sending. Also I don't mind the basic changes to April, but why did they shape her like a potato? Overall it was an enjoyable enough kids movie for an adult to get through, it had some genuine humor and writing to it which I did not expect."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),Go ninja. Go ninja. GO!,"This film did it right. TMNT has survived for nearly forty years, and took them getting back to their roots to make them popular once more. This movie is suitable for kids and adults. Those adults who have kids now, and watched these characters their entire life. The animation is a next level, making it look like art rather than animation. And, for once, the voice actually sound like teenagers. It took them too long to figure that out. There's also an array of actors who voice many characters, it's worth taking a google search. I will probably end up watching this film again. They also don't go for the standard villain. Saving him for next time."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023),Cringe,"It's cringe. I didn't expect this. This movie is just a movie for 5 years old kids, really. They will laugh, especially on that type of silly jokes about family, outdated dad and etc. I am 28 and this is a very sad thing to realize that TMNT universe is getting worser every time. All-time's best is 2003 TMNT animated series Seasons 1-5. Just try to compare it, 80's turtles, Seasons 6-7 of 2003 TMNT, Michael Bay's movie and its sequel, Nickelodeon era, and this one are on the same shame boat, it's all as bad as it can be, very silly created content. Sell the rights to Marvel, please. It may be an option to make TMNT great again."
Saltburn (2023),A monumental waste of time,"Felt nothing but boredom from start to finish even the scenes that I think were disgusting didn't make me feel that way cause it was sooo slow and boring. No idea who wrote/directed this but I really hope this isn't how they think 2000s is supposed to be like. Oh and what's with the aspect ratio? Nice touch lmao we got the next Wes Anderson over here. Yikes. Jacob Elordi bro maybe it's cause you were too convincing as Nate Jacobs but I really didn't buy you being all compassionate and sensitive in this one. The accent didn't sound right either. Anyway you're still the only reason this movie might have found an audience. The stroy, the characters, the plot and the ending is all 1/10. Incredibly boring from start to finish. If you think Jacob Elordi is attractive then maybe you'll enjoy parts of it."
Saltburn (2023),I Liked The Minotaur Statue,"Long, long ago there was a horror film made in 3D called ' The Maze ' and in the centre there was something shocking and terrible. In this film there is something beautiful and threatening. A Minotaur statue with more sexual potency than anything else in this meandering film. I like to think this statue was going to bring down the House of the Ruling Classes, but alas statues move terribly slowly. In all seriousness ( that's a laugh ) with shades of ' Theorem ' and ' The Servant ' a handsome young man gets involved with horror of horrors another young man and takes him home to his architecturally appalling pile and introduces him to daddy, mummy and infantile sister. Familiar territory and with veiled homoeroticism a gullible audience like me gets a few Hammer horror shocks. The grave scene by the way is not that shocking and only one scene is but no more spoilers. The actors do their best, but the two leading young males seemed to walk and dance their way through, but Mulligan and Pike steal what is left to steal. Putting it gently I give it a three because in some weird way it does represent the UK today, and as an historical document for the future it maybe valid. If Cinema as we feebly know it now exists by then."
Saltburn (2023),Deep Black Satire that breaks some cinematic barriers.,"A deeply dark, black satire that has already ruffled a few feathers amongst some English establishment figures. This wicked class comedy is at times sharply damning of the system it stems from yet never quite manages to smash through the class ceiling and ends with a certain degree of sympathy for its intended victims. There are some fine performances here from lady of the manor Rosamund Pike, her dippy, hippy friend Carey Mulligan and Barry Keoghan as a deceptive, head-working Scouser who comes to stay for the summer, or... maybe longer. Downtown Abbey it is not: prepare to be shocked and shaken out of any preconceptions you may have about English country house dramas. There are some references to Brideshead Revisited, Women in Love, Harry Potter and other British class conscious films, yet director Emerald Fennell throws these out like confetti to throw us off the scent of what's going on. We find that out during a madcap final 20 minutes. However, Fennel has already thrown us one or two rather stomach churning clues - this is a director not shy about breaking cinematic barriers, rather like a young Ken Russell did 50 years ago; and like Russell her films are all the better for it. You have been warned."
Saltburn (2023),"Hauntingly twisted, a must-see film!","Nothing will prepare you for the absolute mind-bend that is this film. It is raw, disturbing, amazing, and so wonderfully fantastically twisted. I can't stop thinking about it. Saltburn perfectly encapsulates the deepest darkest corners of lust, desire, and greed while shedding light on what being an outcast really looks like. The characters are as equally lovable as they are loathsome which doesn't make sense now but it will. If you are the type who loves dark, sinister, caught-off-guard kind of films, this is the film for you. I recommend this for anyone looking for a rollercoaster ride of emotions, dark themes, twisted scenes, and an overall insane experience. Please please please... do yourself a favour and watch without spoilers. Enjoy my friends."
Saltburn (2023),"Suspend Disbelief, Enjoy the Derivative","Talented Mr...., I mean The Great Gat...., crap I mean The Social Netw.... Dammit, sorry, ""Saltburn,"" is a phenomenally fun movie, with dark overtones scattered throughout. I have seen some mentions of this being derivative and requiring a suspension of disbelief - GOOD - enjoy it and do that. It's a hell of a movie that I enjoyed thoroughly. This movie is not ""unintentionally hilarious."" It is intentionally hilarious and I believe if you enter into it knowing that you will enjoy it as much as I did. To that point - my favorite part - when the police are investigating the death at the end of the movie, and they keep getting lost in the maze.... Brilliant."
Saltburn (2023),Meh - It's been done better,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" meets any number of homoerotic class-struggle prestige pieces. Given the advance press and buzz, I kept expecting something more, something better, but this movie doesn't go beyond the cliches. Even the ""shocking"" scenes that everyone talks about feel un-earned: gratuitous flashes of fetish in the middle of an otherwise paint-by-numbers exercise. Jacob Elordi is pretty. Barry Keoghan does his deadpan thing, which was disturbing and compelling in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" but here just feels blank. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant are fun as stereotyped daffy British aristos, but the other supporting characters make no impression whatsoever. The storytelling telegraphs every reveal in the first few minutes, and then feels the need for a ""Sixth Sense"" style flashback at the end to say, ""Look! We surprised you! Bet you didn't see that coming!"" Pointless and disappointing."
Saltburn (2023),Overrated movie who lacks originality,"I had high expectations on this film. The cinematography was amazing, I enjoyed the film and each actor's performances. However, the plot lacks originality when its basically an other version of Talented Mr Ripley. The writing is so poor, with forced and unnatural dialogues which made every performance look like they were faking the scenarios. And every situation didnt make sense. I could see that Emerald Fennell had a big idea for this film, with the 2006 aesthetics and aristocratic storyline, but it didnt reach to its potential. The main character, Oliver, was at first portrayed as an innocent boy whose family is poor. In the middle of the movie we started to realize that Oliver isnt who we thouht he was, as he was manipulating people. At the end we saw a psychotic boy with an obsessive and evil plan. But what waa his agenda? To inherit Saltburn because he wanted to escape his middle class boring all american life? Or did he really love Felix, but killed him because he knew his secret? Well none of that came through the film. Instead the movie was left with unsolved questions."
Saltburn (2023),A PREPPY TOM RIPLEY...?,"Oscar winner Emerald Fennell's sophomore effort is another scabrous indictment of the jet set starring Oscar nominee Barry Keoghan. Keoghan has entered Oxford & right away he's signaled out as being not part of the in crowd. Soon enough through a fluke of fate, Keoghan makes some inroads w/the lead alpha Jacob Elordi (from Max's Euphoria) & soon enough they become besties to the chagrin of Archie Madekwe (from Gran Turismo), a friend of Eloridi's family. After they graduate, Elordi extends an invitation to Keoghan to stay at the titular named estate w/his family; mom, Oscar nominee Rosamund Pike, dad, Oscar nominee Richard E. Grant, Madekwe & Elordi's sister Alison Oliver for the summer. Once there he settles into the rhythm of this rich, out of touch clan & soon enough due to time or comfort, Keoghan soon makes headway winning all but Madekwe over but when they decide to throw him a birthday party, Elordi, who believes Keoghan comes from desperate straits, decides to take Keoghan to his own home where he finds his parents are alive & well & frankly boring & bourgeois. Elordi has had enough of his charade & decides to cut ties w/Keoghan, after the blowout bash of course, which ends up being a fatal mistake for Elordi & the rest of his tribe. Playing like a mirthful take on Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley character, Keoghan is the ultimate inveigler, insinuating himself into his well-off fold where his grand plans of showing the other side up becomes a bloody affair w/a proud 'cock of the walk' nude victory at film's end is an acid dipped icing on the cake. Look for Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan, working again w/Fennell, playing a tiresome friend of the family who has overstayed her welcome."
Saltburn (2023),Intoxicating,"Honestly I was totally enchanted by this film... especially the dynamic between Ollie and Felix. It seems like quite a bromance until the end explains all... as much as it might seem one way... Oliver loves Felix. I was captivated enough by shots of Ollie's behind, captivated by a certain bathtub scene, a certain funerary display... but was floored when he dances naked in the end. I was not expecting that at all... I almost thought I willed it to happen, I almost felt seduced by Ollie myself... the actor Barry Keoghan is absolutely beautiful. More so I'm glad directors are starting to realize what an untapped frontier the male nude is. It is far too one sided in cinema. Is it really so necessary to expose women but never men? Obviously women aren't always nude in context... I'm glad this film wasn't scared to go in these directions. SO many Agatha Christie mysteries have a twist like this story... bravo."
Saltburn (2023),Gratuitous and unsatisfying,"**spoiler below** A movie that had the seeds of greatness but ultimately fails. Seemingly the production decided to tick as many boxes as possible of distasteful, drawn out scenes placed more for their shock value than to advance the story. The rather simple story ultimately devolves into a contrived finale where you can practically here some one whispering the virtues of the ""modern"" (now cliche) approach of grossing us out, making us hate a character and capping the torture by letting that bad guy we hate win. Yawn. It's been done better and more tastefully. The good? - The actors do a good job animating some one dimensional characters though. The scenery is great and the music decent. You won't be sorry you missed this one."
Anyone But You (2023),TERRIBLE ACTING,DREADFUL ACTING. TERRIBLY CORNY AND A SHAME SINCE THE INITIAL SCENE IN THE COFFEE SHOP WAS VERY GOOD. THE TWO MAIN STARS WERE VERY LIKEABLE BUT THE SCRIPT WAS SHOCKINGLY BAD. SOME OF THE ACTORS IN THE FILM CANNOT ACT ALAS. NOT BRYAN BROWN AS THE GUY CAN ACT BUT NOT EVEN HIM WITH THIS SCRIPT! THE PRODUCERS AND THE DIRECTOR SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF TURNING NOT A BAD IDEA INTO A CORNY FILM. IT PAINS ME TO WRITE ANYMORE AS THIS DREADFUL FILM IS NOT WORTHY OF ANY MORE CRITIQUE. I WOULD ADVISE THAT A WOMAN DID CHUCKLE THE ODD TIME BESIDE ME. SO SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ENJOY THIS GENTLE ROMCOM! ALAS NOT US.
Anyone But You (2023),I was torn,"After seeing the trailer for this movie my expectations weren't too high, however I still wanted to see it & I thought maybe the trailer was just badly edited.. but it just feels like a hallmark movie with slightly better actors. The dialogue was so terrible I found myself rolling my eyes at times but there were a few decent laughs throughout. All in all it was a decent movie & it definitely gets better as you watch it. I'm not sure I would recommend seeing it in theaters though maybe wait for it to hit streaming & judge for yourself. It's one of those I probably won't remember in a year or 2. Oh & the montage at the very end was probably one of my favorite parts it definitely had some feel good moments!"
Anyone But You (2023),I wish I could see this all over again for the first time.,"OK, maybe it's dumb fun ... and it won't win an Oscar, but it had my whole theater room fully entertained (mostly late teen girls and their moms, it seemed). It delivers the male sexy, for sure, including some moments where there were covering-of-eyes but still with a peek. And Sweeney shines, as well as the Miranda character, in both acting and presence. Some of the close dialogue was a bit stifled or trite. Glen Powell has exercise scenes on the beach, since that worked for ""Maverick,"" right? I'm a fan of the 1993 ""Much Ado about Nothing"" film from Kenneth Branagh. Consider checking that out after seeing this. You'll see phrases from Shakespeare's work throughout the film in transitions and in some speech. Also, the film's made money, Sweeney is one of the Executive Producers, and so good for her. And she's certainly been busy; you'll probably be shown a trailer for ""Madame Web,"" coming soon."
Anyone But You (2023),Attractive people in various forms of undress,Anyone but you is a newly released romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney as Bea and Glen Powell as Ben and is directed by Will Gluck. Bea and Ben just happen to meet eachother by chance in a coffee shop and immediately gain a liking for eachother. They spend an evening together but in the morning due to some crossed wires they go their separate ways with a dislike for eachother. Cut to six months later and Bea's sister happens to be getting married to one of Bens friends and so they find themselves stuck in eachothers way. This initially causes conflict that is until both characters realise it may be advantageous to both of them to pretend to like eachother. What follows is a mediocre romantic comedy with overall likeable characters but with only a few laughs. Don't get me wrong I know comedy is a really difficult genre as humour is so subjective. I just felt that this film didn't even really try thinking outside the box when it came to its jokes. Yes there's the expected typical sex jokes that always get a light chuckle out of most audiences however it's nothing you haven't heard/seen before. The film to me seemed to try to sell itself on the sole basis of having an attractive cast. It then goes a step further and has its cast appear in various forms of undress throughout the film. Sydney Sweeney almost always has a fair amount of cleavage showing for instance. Don't worry though ladies there's plenty of abs and men's bums too. It all just felt like a distraction though to a story that's about as generic as they come. A nice distraction but a distraction nonetheless. Just fine.
Anyone But You (2023),Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! There were multiple times throughout I laughed so hard that I almost peed my pants, but I wouldn't leave to go to the bathroom because I didn't want to miss anything. The two leads had such good chemistry and I think that is what drove me to be so attached to this movie. Much like a Hallmark movie, it was pretty predictable, you knew they were gonna end up together but of course there had to be some type of miscommunication to drive them apart so they could come back together in a super romantic gesture. Stereotypical? Yes. But made it super fun to watch? Also yes. I think it also helped that the two leads are incredibly attractive. As I left the theater I decided I would absolutely buy this movie when it comes out because I already want to watch again. Highlt recommend if you're in need of a fun rom com to put you in a good mood!"
Anyone But You (2023),Sydney Sweeney casts herself in a movie she's producing and fails,"I almost didn't see this movie because I was sick of how much they were marketing it, but I miss rom-coms and haven't seen a good one in a while. This movie was hard to get through. Sydney and Glenn both have unique but odd looks to. Me, they kind of have chemistry, but I almost feel like this movie could have been better with two different leads. Sydney Is good with supporting roles but she's not lead material imo and it's physically uncomfortable to watch her try way too hard to be sexy. I think I read another comment about this in a review and I've always thought she tries to be something she isn't. The dialogue is okay, but I don't remember much, and overall, I don't love how predictable the movie is. Obviously, some rom coms can be but they're still fun to see how it pans out, but this movie was terrible. I miss old rom-coms from the early 2000s like Notting Hill, Love Actually, and a Cinderella Story. Anyone But You was awkward, kind of forgettable, and only had maybe 1 scene that was kind of interesting."
Anyone But You (2023),Almost Soft Porn NOT Romantic!,The preview made it look like a cute romcom but it was not! The writing was so so lazy and rushed. A guy full screen close up of the head of his pecker (for no reason). That shot still has me scratching my head. It was out of the blue. A shower seen that made absolutely no sense. It left me filling dirty and sad. The big romantic speech that is supposed to make you swoon had a couple f-bombs. Just made it impossible to feel the flutters or giggles a romcom is supposed to. It was more of a how sad it is if this is what they call romantic now 😢 It had potential it could have been cute but it was disappointing 😞
Anyone But You (2023),The Marketing for this Movie Did Not do it Justice,"The trailer and marketing for this movie put me off, but when I heard it was loosely based off Much Ado About Nothing and heard good things, we decided to check it out. Really glad we did. There was plenty of laugh out loud moments, quick moving plot, a range of characters and their connections to one another, and all in all just a bit of fun. It is a Romcom, so like you would expect of the genre, you know where it is going to end up but it was an enjoyable ride getting there. Do get frustrated with people expecting this genre to ""be better"", but this delivers everything you would want it to. Definitely recommend as a cheesy date night or a girls night out!"
Anyone But You (2023),A delightful adaptation of a classic,"One of the better adaptations of a Shakespeare play. Both faithful to the original text and reinvigorated by a modern twist. I wish there had been an ""Against my will I am sent to bid you come into dinner"" scene as that is iconic. I am fascinated with how they adapted the ""Ado"" in that is ended up not really having anything to do with H+C. It did feel like the Jonathan/Don John part was a little thin and perhaps was at one point more substantial, but to be fair it is one of the least motivated villains in Shakespeare so perhaps that tracks. Highlights would be the adaptation of Beau/Borachio and that the name of the bakery is Dogberry."
Anyone But You (2023),A future classic rom-com,"This is one of those movies that gets better in my head the more it lingers in there. As the movie was unfolding, I thought it was fine and had some cute and funny moments, but I didn't think too highly of it. But as it progressed towards the end and they brought everything together, it really hit for me and I've only thought of it more positively since leaving the theater. I think it hit the romantic and comedic sides equally well. The chemistry between the two leads was solid and certainly engaging, because I found myself continuously frustrated when things kept not working out between them, and when they finally did, it was done really well. And on the comedic side, there are easily 5+ scenes I can remember that made me laugh out loud and ones that I'd love to be able to watch again right now. Finally, the emotional side of things was done well too, especially how they tied everything together with Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield and everyone singing together at the end definitely put a smile on my face."
Poor Things (2023),Yorgos don't miss,"Another fantastic movie from Mr. Lanthimos. One of the most entertaining retellings of the Frankenstein story I've ever seen. Maybe the best. That's definitely debatable. The story was marvelous and well written. It's split into acts based on Bella's (Emma Stone) journey. Speaking of Emma Stone, she was incredible here. Some of her best work imo. Her ability to show the different sides of Bella's development was astounding. Everyone is cooking honestly. Mark Ruffalo is in his bag. Really doing something new and different for him. William DeFoe is crushing as always. And even the side characters all come through with great performances. Some of the cinematography was top notch. Really felt like you were watching a watercolor painting come to life. I loved this movie. Only a 9/10 because it felt a lil long. Definitely worth a watch for fans of his work!"
Poor Things (2023),Bizarre but Beautiful,"My Review -Poor Things
In selected Cinemas now 9/10 I suspect that there will definitely be two camps of movie goers reactions to this very R rated dream like gothic Adult fairy tale those that love its absurdity and those that loathe it . I really loved it and think that the creative team of screen writer Tony McNamara and Director Yorgos Lanthimos who gave us the Favourite in 2018 have struck lightning twice with an original and thoughtful black rom com that has its roots in the gothic genre of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Movies for me often seems like cake baking it often depends on the ingredients as to whether I think they are successful or not . Poor Things for me has all the right ingredients a superb performance from its star Emma Stone plus an impressive supporting cast . The other vital ingredients for me in this movie is its creative team which I'll refer to later. I got flavours or little influences of past great movie makers like James Whale who directed the 1931 Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein 1935 ,Tim Burton's Corpse Bride 2005, and Mel Brooks humour in Young Frankenstein 1974 . I also loved the impressionistic look of this movie at times reminding me of the work of the Spanish artists Antoni Gaudí and Salvador Dalí. The movie Poor things is based on a 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray , Its stand out performance comes from Emma Stone as Bella Baxter a young woman who is literally raised from the dead by the disfigured experimental Dr Goodwin Baxter after a successful suicide attempt. The Doctor restarts her heart in his laboratory after removing Bella's adult brain replacing it with her unborn baby daughter's brain . Of course the concept sounds gross but is it really in today's world of medical cloning cryogenics and genetic experimentation . Bella Baxter after recovering has no recollection of her previous life and is a baby in an adult woman's body. She is awkward at first learning to walk and talk and begins to develop the curiosity of all life's experiences including sexual gratification. Any healthy baby brain would begin to experience her curiosity except for the fact that Bella's body is adult so
she innocently discovers and equates sexual desire with happiness
This is where the originality of this Adults only fantasy thickens when this child nymphomaniac in an adult body meets a debauched lawyer named Duncan Wedderburn a foppish mustachioed scalawag played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo in a role that is one of the most entertaining elements of Poor Things. In an interview Mark Ruffalo said I'm getting a little bored of myself as Mark Ruffalo,"" he added. ""I was trying to take the ship as close to the reef as I could possibly get without actually running aground. He added he thinks it was the most fun he's had in a movie and that's obvious from his performance. Let's stop here for a moment to remember Dr Victor Frankenstein because the similarities are obvious especially with the lightning strikes in the Doctors laboratory as Bella comes back to life. However from then on Tony McNamara takes us off on a totally different journey into a surreal world divided into chapters . The Beginning, Bella Baxter is born in Dr Goodwin's laboratory -Portugal Bella runs away with Duncan Wedderburn a debauched lawyer - The Boat driven by his jealousy towards Bella's suitors Wedderburn isolates Bella - At Sea - Alexandria- Bella discovers her conscience and attempts to help the poor and starving with Wedderburn's gambling winnings ,- Paris Bella discovers the oldest profession in the world when she and Wedderburn become stranded in Paris and separate after becoming penniless,, and finally London where Bella is confronted with her past life. Dr Goodwin Baxter who Bella calls God is a fascinating character study brilliantly played by Willem Dafoe . Somehow he manages to make this monstrous grotesquely scarred Doctor seem almost kind in his affection for Bella. A victim of generational child abuse the cruelty the Doctor experienced as a child from a father that treated him like a medical experiment is revealed. I could almost understand the motives for his continued experimentation. His grotesque makeup is amazing
Willem Dafoe described the makeup process, ""Four hours in, two hours out every day and showing up at three o'clock in the morning, sitting in the chair, meditating and trying to deal with standing still. I also enjoyed the weird atonal minimalist score by Jerskin Fendrix which added to the many bizzare moments in this film. Two of the many memorable scenes for me were the weird but brilliant crazy dance scene where Bella discovers her musical rhythm and the Paris brothel scenes where she is employed by the sleazy tattooed madam Swiney played with delicious decadence by Kathryn Hunter. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan , set decorator Zsuzsa Mihalek , costume designer Holly Waddington and Production Designers Shona Heath and James Price have done a superb job at taking us into this surreal world of absurdity. Be prepared for an absurd adventure with weird animals like chickens with pig heads dogs with ducks heads and a goat with a human brain all part of Doctor Godwin Baxter's cabinet of curiosities. Poor Things is sure to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards and as much as I hope Carrie Mulligan who is My Favourite wins this year I would not be to surprised if Emma Stone scored her 2nd Best Actress Oscar it often goes to actresses in very unconventional roles . What a great way to start my movie year."
Poor Things (2023),Faux-feminist & tasteless garbage,"I wanted to like this film...but no. This film is just disturbing, and not in a good way. The film is about an INFANT who has her brain put into a woman's (the infant's mom) body. While the character may look like an adult, she is not...she is a CHILD. Let's make that clear. Immediately the child starts masturbating. Okay, uncomfortable, but maybe the director has something to say. So I stick with it. Next thing you know the child's father is offering her up to get married by his adult assistant who KNOWS that he is proposing to a child. A few scenes later Mark Ruffalo's character sneaks into her room, molests her and kidnaps her where he has rampant sex with her for several excruitatingly long scenes that span weeks if not months. It's crass and it's tasteless given that the character is a little girl with an adult woman's body, but again, while I wince, I'm assuming that it's going to all come together with some powerful social commentary that will be poignant and insightful. I'm mean, the reviews are stellar. Surely this will not be for naught...right? What is the characters big revelatory moment? She finds her agency by becoming a prostitute and - voila! - she's a complete human, a feminist at that! So essentially you have this little girl go through some seriously traumatic sexual abuse (replete with director awkwardly shows her insatiable desire for sex with adult men by having her literally beg for it constantly)...and then by ""embracing"" prostitution she is somehow magically ""liberated"" and transforms into a self-actualized being. Okay then. Not only is this some poorly thought out social commentary and character development, but it's quite warped and disturbed if you let it sink in. This just felt like some perverted guy wrapping some sordid child sex abuse fantasy with a flimsy facade of female empowerment, except that empowerment isn't earned or justified given what happens in the story. Actually, I would say quite the opposite. Add in some really heavy handed and poorly construed themes (e.g., she literally refers to her father -like figure God...really now?) and some seriously forced situational comedy and you have just an insufferable film. The only bright side for me was the art direction and costume design. All style, no substance."
Poor Things (2023),Superb upside down and sideways take on Frankenstein,"Based on the novel by Alasdair Gray and adapted by Tony McNamara, Yorgos Lanthimos' POOR THINGS is like a backwards and upside down take on the Frankenstein myth. As to be expected, Lanthimos was never going to do a straightforward adaptation (even of the novel), and his penchant for the bizarre and outrageousness is at the fore from the very beginning. Bella Baxter (a fearless Emma Stone) is the latest creation of Dr. Godwin Baxter (the always reliable Willem Dafoe) - ""God"" to his few confidants. She's the 'monster' with a young woman's body but the mind of a mere child. When one of God's students, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef - solid), arrives to observe Bella, he's as smitten as he is horrified at the Doctor's not quite human-being. The abode is also a veritable menagerie of various mutants and failed experiments. God's castle-like home and laboratory is the first of many elaborate fantastical settings for Production Designers Shona Heath and James Price to play with. Robbie Ryan's expressive cinematography shifts between B&W and Color - and always on actual 35mm film (it's framed in a throwback 1:66 aspect ratio). Jerskin Fendrix' musical score is his feature debut and it's iconoclastic. As striking as the early scenes are, the film truly takes flight when Bella is let loose upon the world by a rakish solicitor played by Mark Ruffalo. Bella is whirled across Europe and on a cruise ship ravishly sampling all of the sensory and physical delights of the world, especially those of a carnal nature. Lanthimos doesn't shy away from Bella's wanton newfound sexuality and revels in displaying its many varieties(perhaps a bit too relishly). It's certainly the randiest Frankenstein film since Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol's X-Rated 1974 version (thankfully, we are spared the 3D details!). Stone embraces the erotic sequences with abandon - but, approaches them with a keen purpose. This long section of the movie also serves to show Bella's maturation on an intellectual level. Her mind is genuinely expanded along with her corpus. Her transformation could be read as feminist (and on many levels, it is), but, in a genuinely clever way; Many of the film's themes link up with Mary Shelley's 19th Century source novel. The notion of a person created against their will and desiring to be free to choose one's life path is successfully distilled here. The creation must grow and challenge their maker. Bella's drive is to seek to become articulate and experienced - to become their own creator. To have a true soul. To be their own 'God'. When Bella returns to Dr. Baxter, the film becomes almost its own sequel. Another significant chapter or two, if a bit curtailed in length. There is also one last adroit twist which is a direct homage to a certain classic horror film of similar vintage to that of James Whale's 1931 masterpiece FRANKENSTEIN. Lanthimos' POOR THINGS is a brilliantly designed film in both style and substance. The thematics are in tune with the design elements and vice-versa. Some of the musical selections and over-use of distorted lenses do distract, but it wouldn't be a Lanthimos film if everything was proper and pleasing. Stone is a wonder here and the large supporting cast is mostly spot on (Ruffalo is a bit miscast) with a nice turn by Kathryn Hunter as the brothel madam (Hunter was also superb in Joel Coen's TRAGEDY OF MACBETH)."
Poor Things (2023),Another interesting film from Lanthimos,"Yorgos Lanthimos is continuing to do a great job of maintaining a singular style while also doing something different with each new film he makes. I don't necessarily agree with the people who say Wes Anderson sticks to his style too much, but if Lanthimos keeps taking further creative risks the way he's been doing, I don't imagine many people will ever accuse him of a such a thing. Plot-wise, Poor Things is sort of a coming-of-age story, but in a way that's not only hard to describe, but probably better off not describing. The premise is actually kind of similar to the weird Australian cult classic Bad Boy Bubby: we spend a decent amount of time with someone who l has the appearance of an adult but a mind like that of a child, remains trapped in a single location, and then after about 20-30 minutes, they're let out into the world, with all its surprises, wonders, and horrors. Narratively there are similarities, and both films also have some very let's say graphic content, but visually and tonally, they're pretty different. Poor Things might be a tad too long. I at first thought Willem Dafoe's continued presence in the story was hurting the pacing, but I like the direction his character went in, by the end. I think the last 20 minutes hurts the overall film, though. A character emerges who it makes sense should emerge, but they spend a weird amount of time on him and it's mostly a detour before things reach an otherwise satisfying conclusion. That sequence aside, I liked this film a lot. It looks amazing, it's very funny in parts, and Emma Stone is excellent. It also might have my favourite performance Mark Ruffalo's ever given, too."
Poor Things (2023),"A mixed review, but the film ultimately prevails","I went into the theater knowing I was Poor Things' target audience-I like quirky characters, arthouse vibes, stunning aesthetics + themes of challenging cultural norms. In a lot of ways I felt very pandered to, but I've never watched a superhero movie that held my interest so I welcome some pandering at this point. By the end of the movie I felt I could forgive much of the ""on the nose"" aspects. I have to admit I was bored during quite a bit of the film. However, there are incredible moments that will stay in my memory for a long time-brilliant lines written and themes explored between the drawn-out, meandering scenes. Not to mention Emma Stone's utter brilliance in understanding her character and how to endear Bella to her audience. Mark Ruffalo's character started strong, then spun out into the pathetically absurd, but again, I collected gems from this movie that I didn't have before and feel glad I saw it overall. As far as the sex goes, I'd just say get over it. The U. S. is so afraid of its shadow, and people with raging pørn addictions will give this a low rating because they don't like that the filmmakers exposed it in the light of matinee. I was much more disturbed by the (sometimes gratuitous) cutting open of dead bodies, but I recognize it's a personal preference for me to avoid seeing these things, not a moral failing on the movie's part."
Poor Things (2023),Missed the point entirely,"The desire to be weird and avant garde meant a director who has built a career on weird and avant garde missed the entire point of the story. This really should be called, 'A Ropey Telling Of 25% Of Poor Things Missing The Most Important Point' I suspect Gray is laughing in his grave at how the culture snobs who made, and are now gushing over this have managed to sucker themselves. I'm sure he saw them coming. I suppose that's the main comedy element of the film. Seen as 'A Ropey Telling Of 25% Of Poor Things Missing The Most Important Point', it's rather fun. Though, some things did grate. Stone's acting and dialogue suggested a robot rather than a child. Most of the swearing was unnecessary and detracted - seemingly put there to force a laugh. A little more intelligence in the script would've served this particular story a bit better. I would've preferred a more conventional nineteenth century setting to juxtapose against the weirdness rather than have everything built full Willy Wonka-esque. And some of the characters and story points that were left out would've put a lot more meat on this thin gruel had they been included. Very poor. Very poor indeed."
Poor Things (2023),Disappointed,"I thought it would be a good movie for my husband's birthday. I was so wrong! The ratings were good on IMDB...don't believe it! It had great actors Mike Wilem Dafoe, Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo. It was horrible! Gross and over done sex scenes of nasty men with Emma Stone (I am not a a prude). One couple left within 20 minutes. Emma Stones character was totally unsympathetic and gross. She was basically nude or panting through most of the film and not in a good way. It was a weird and gross movie. It was a HUGE disappointment and a waste of three hours of our time! Why?????????!!???????????????"
Poor Things (2023),"Beautiful scenes, weak story, too much sex.","I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of this movie, the black and white scenes, the really interesting and funny behavior of Emma as a baby in a matured body, the story of the mad scientist, it really got me hooked up. I lost all interest after that, it was too much explicit sex, too much shocking scenes, seems like she learned how to speak as an adult, but never actually matured. Mark Ruffalo's british accent is terrible, it was so hard to watch Emma's perfect phrases and him just barely getting out of that american accent. The ending felt rushed as we get to see a little bit of the life of the suiciding mother, I would enjoy to learn more about her than to see all those sex scenes. I'll give it a 4, it has some really beautiful shots and sets, other than that it feels more like a soft porn than a an actual movie."
Poor Things (2023),A most sublime movie,"Poor things is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer) and is supported with a strong cast, namely Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafoe. The first impression you get from this movie is bizarre to say the least. In fact, it takes some time to get used to the ambiance which is nothing short of macabre. And surely, this impression lasts throughout the whole movie; but this feeling of weirdness and incomprehension serves the plot and in this sense, is most welcome. Eventually, there comes a time where, inevitably, and without even realizing it, you are suctioned right in, never to escape again. And you are glad to be trapped in what is essentially pit of limitless pleasure. Indeed, one of the things the movie does very well is make you, along with the protagonist, embark on an adventure. Sure, you might have been to the places the protagonist went to, but those are presented in a most wonderful way. The aesthetics are magnificient and otherworldly. I do not know how they did it, but I remember being in awe and it is a feeling that I will cherish for a lifetime. It is truly a sight to behold. It is the kind of movie which makes you feel grateful to be alive."
Love Actually (2003),Lewd Actually,"Very disappointing. Sad that so many movies contain graphic sex scenes which gets guys to watch but requires no writing talent at all. Would have loved a movie simply focusing on Hugh Grants character. The rest was filthy talk and even graphic sex scenes. People can get that garbage at a porno web site. Takes no talent at all to write that type script whatsoever. It will get you good ratings however. Should've been named ""Lewd Actually"" or ""Lust Actually"". Sad commentary on today's devastated families through divorce because of lifestyles portrayed in this piece of trash movie. I give it 3 stars only because of Hugh Grants character."
Love Actually (2003),A Disjointed Anthology with Shallow Love Stories and Decent Performances,"Love Actually falls short as a good movie, presenting itself as an anthology of different stories with pieces connecting them. While there might be some likable elements in each story, it's a written mess carried by its actors, whom you might only watch because you appreciate their work outside of this film. They deliver an okay performance, but the lack of substantial material limits their impact. For a film exploring different types and ways of love, every story feels incredibly shallow, featuring characters making stupid decisions without much payoff. Despite being a Christmas film with entertaining actors, the overall lack of meaningful events may leave you questioning whether it was worth watching. It's a divisive film, and while some may really hate it or love it, I land on the 'do not care' side of the reception for this film."
Love Actually (2003),Unapologetically British and totally Christmas,"Love actually is all around on Christmas. ""Love, actually"" is a very British comedy about love on Christmas, and the magic of Christmas and the spirit of Christmas. It's a really clever idea of having many small and completely different stories being the focus of this movie because love comes in different kinds. The clever thing is that somehow all these stories do interact woth each other but each and every one of them serves its own purpose. Emma Thompson I think speaks to the hearts of many women around the globe, and her performance is very poignant and raw and real. Hugh Grant's story is here to remind us of Clinton and Lewinsky. And Keira Knightley of course steals the hearts of many once again. Some very iconic scenes, some great pop-culture moments and a ridiculous song and performance by a great Bill Nighy. ""Love, actually"" is unapologetically British and absolutely ridiculous and bonkers and I love it. A perfect holiday movie."
Love Actually (2003),Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, an enjoyable Christmas movie that is carried by its writing and performances as we get to see the unique concept of multiple storylines happening in parallel with their common goal of finding love, though it is a bit bloated from having too many subplots and suffers from many Rom-Com and early 2000s cliches. Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as he connects the different storylines into one overarching plot (though the world-building felt very typical to other Rom-Coms); the direction on a microscale was pretty typical to other Rom-Coms (though executed well); the direction of actors was good as it felt like everyone was connected and gave a performance that helped move the movie forward; the storytelling was pretty unique as it juggles multiple different subplots that converge to a giant ending), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Hugh Grant (Uses his charm, charisma, and experience in romantic movies to aid his performance), Good from Liam Neeson (My favorite performance in the cast as he develops a strong chemistry with his son and effectively displays grief from the loss of his wife), Pretty Good from Colin Firth (Uses his experience in romantic movies to propel this performance forward), Pretty Good from Laura Linney (Felt a bit out of place, but does well in the scenes she is in), Good from Emma Thompson (Shows betrayal well and has a good range of emotion throughout the movie), Pretty Good to Good from Alan Rickman (A surprisingly comedic performance from Rickman, but he holds his own well and shows some range of emotion (at least however much he can with his mundane voice)), Pretty Good from Keira Knightley (Really just a name as she isn't given that much screen time (but still does a pretty good job with the scenes she is in)), Pretty Good from Martine McCutcheon (Works well off of Grant), Pretty Good from Bill Nighy (A very over-the-top performance that provides humor in his non-sequitur scenes), Pretty Good from Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean), Pretty Good from Lúcia Moniz (Has chemistry with Colin Firth), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role well as this movie is more about an ensemble cast than a singular performance)), Good Story (The concept was very unique as the different storylines converging to one was a pretty new idea at the time (though it was heavily exploited after), there are a little too many stories (maybe could have cut the 1-2 of them to make the movie a bit tighter); the plot structure was very unique as it was multiple storylines converging to one climax (though there are some other climaxes as not all the storylines converge to the same point); flow between sequences was surprisingly good as the transitions between the different stories were seamless at times (using music and characters); character writing was good as you get a sense of what each character's struggle was and what they are looking for during the holiday season), Good Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty good and flowed well (but did have cliche Rom-Com lines); the movie has some very iconic scenes that were parodied/referenced in other forms of media; the humor was good (though did feel very 00s); the symbolism was kinda light (but its a Rom-Com so I cannot complain that much); the foreshadowing was very good as it was used effectively to help connect the different storylines together), Pretty Good Score/Pretty Good Soundtrack (Helps set the Christmas tone), Decent Cinematography, Decent Sound, Good Editing (Helps with transitioning between the different stories), Pacing was pretty good as it did not feel very slow or fast, Climax was executed well as it converges many of the storylines to one singular event (and the climaxes of the other storylines were also handled well), Tone felt exactly was the genre was (A Christmas, Rom-Com)"
Love Actually (2003),A Reminder That We Are All Looking For Love,"When it comes to love, we find it comes in many forms and in mysterious ways. Showcasing the truest bits of love found in everyday life, Love Actually gives us multiple stories of a human struggle. Starting off a bit slow, the individual relationships are all fleshed out distinctly and create a very unique and charming tale. While each story is fairly entertaining, some of them are worth more emotional investment, leaving others feeling like perfect bathroom breaks. Although it isn't perfect, it all comes together in a beautiful ensemble in the end. Complete with an all star cast, this film is an English 'Who's Who' of celebrities, each adding a cute and fun performance to their story. It is fun getting to see these big actors interacting in such quirky ways and taking on roles that are delightfully unexpected. Love Actually takes us on a very real and human journey through the love and lives of different individuals, reminding us that it comes we are all just people, in need of love."
Love Actually (2003),A funny yet sentimental and touching film exploring love in all its aspects,"When you think of the word ""love"", what words come to your mind? Maybe it is lust, attraction and sex? Maybe it is sharing sweet and romantic moments together? Or maybe it is unbridled faithfulness and devotion over time? This movie explores all of these aspects of love and more. Interwoven within this movie are stories of people from all walks of life from the young to the old. Each person explores a facet of love like a diamond glistening brightly reflecting its light and beauty in various different ways. E.g. We see those pure moments where time seemingly slows down as a person is enraptured by someone else for the first time. We also see how power can influence and potentially corrupt the dynamic of people in romantic relationships e.g. Superiors and subordinates. The film showcases the joy of couples getting married whilst also showing the sorrows of unrequited love. The film also examines the themes of dating, casual relationships, and temptation in the face of faithfulness. Love Actually is an enjoyable film that is funny, lighthearted, sentimental, and romantic. It will appeal to people of all ages who want to experience vicariously what it means to be in love. This film will surely bring you and your loved one into a romantic mood by the end. It is an instant classic rom-com and well worth the watch! Highly recommended!"
Love Actually (2003),love Actually: after math,"Love Actually, a film that has garnered praise for its star-studded cast and holiday charm, presents a mixed bag of emotions for viewers seeking a fresh take on romance. While the ensemble cast brings familiar faces to the screen, the movie's reliance on well-worn romantic clichés and its struggle to provide depth to its characters raise questions about its lasting impact. One of the noticeable aspects of Love Actually is its abundant use of romantic tropes. From the shy confessions of unspoken love to the grand gestures that seem to conveniently unfold, the film embraces these clichés with open arms. While some may argue that familiarity is part of the charm, it leaves others, like myself, wanting more substance and originality. The predictability of the plotlines undermines the potential for genuine surprises and emotional resonance. The ensemble cast, featuring notable actors such as Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth, is undoubtedly one of the film's selling points. However, the star power fails to translate into compelling characters. The individuals portrayed often lack the depth needed to make their romantic journeys truly engaging. It becomes a parade of famous faces navigating through storylines that, despite their potential, feel one-dimensional and fail to establish a meaningful connection with the audience. Love Actually attempts to explore the multifaceted nature of love by intertwining various storylines. Yet, this ambitious approach results in pacing issues that hinder the overall viewing experience. The transitions between scenes can feel abrupt, making it challenging for viewers to fully immerse themselves in the unfolding narratives. As a result, the film struggles to build and sustain emotional intensity, leaving moments that should resonate feeling disconnected. While the film aims to capture the complexity of love, certain relationships portrayed in Love Actually border on the improbable. From workplace romances that seem far-fetched to connections between characters that lack authenticity, the film's exploration of love often ventures into the realm of fantasy rather than genuine human experience. This contributes to a sense of detachment from the characters and their romantic entanglements. Pacing is a recurring issue in Love Actually, and it reflects the film's attempt to balance a multitude of storylines. The constant shift between characters and scenarios prevents the audience from fully investing in any particular narrative. The lack of a cohesive rhythm undermines the impact of individual moments, leaving the viewer with a fragmented sense of the overall story. In addition to pacing concerns, Love Actually faces criticism for its occasional missteps in portraying relationships. Some character dynamics perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce gender norms, raising questions about the film's cultural sensitivity. While the intent may be lighthearted, these elements detract from the authenticity the film aims to capture. In conclusion, Love Actually, with its star-studded ensemble and holiday charm, falls short of expectations due to its reliance on romantic clichés, pacing issues, and occasional problematic portrayals of relationships. While it has its moments of levity and charm, the overall experience is hindered by a lack of originality and depth. For those seeking a fresh take on romance, Love Actually may leave you wanting, as it navigates the terrain of well-trodden clichés without breaking new ground."
Love Actually (2003),Not to be a Scrooge but how do so MANY people love this movie?,"I've been hearing about this movie since it came out 20 years ago. Never really had a reason to watch it until this year, around Christmas time wanting to watch a Christmas movie I'd never seen before that is considered by many to be super beloved. Listen, I'm not super harsh on most movies but for the most part this just wasn't any good. The super unrealistic storylines were too much for me to bear. A bunch of characters falling in love with each other after only knowing each other a couple weeks; other characters who learn foreign languages fluently in a manner of weeks. It's just too unrealistic, even by most rom com standards. It does have some redeeming scenes like the chemistry between Liam neeson and his step son. But Wtf was up with the Keira knightley story line?!? Talk about weird and awkward af. At first I thought the two guys were gay for each other but then it turns out the one is just in love with his friends wife. And then they end up in a polygamous relationship at the end or something??? Is that what is supposed to be implied? Man, this movie is a mess and I'm not sure why people love it so much. Maybe if I saw it when it first came out I wouldn't feel this way but yeah... idk. I would recommend skipping this one I like the idea of a Christmas movie made specifically for adults but the execution of this film was bad."
Love Actually (2003),Worst movie ever created by humanity,"Alright, so here's the real deal about ""Love Actually."" It's a mess, mate. I mean, they chucked in a boatload of big-name actors, thinking that's all it takes to make a killer rom-com, but nah, it's like they just threw a bunch of random love stories into a blender and hoped for the best. First off, the plot is all over the place. You've got like, what, a million different stories going on? It's like the filmmakers couldn't decide on one good story, so they just went, ""Ah, let's do 'em all!"" The result? A confusing mishmash that's hard to follow. You barely get to know one couple, and whoosh, it's onto the next. The characters, man, they're like cardboard cutouts. There's little depth, and most of 'em are walking clichés. You've got your typical lovesick puppy, the guy who's pining for his best mate's wife (creepy, much?), and don't get me started on the whole American girls falling for the bumbling Brit thing. It's like they picked the most stereotypical traits and ran with it. And the humor? It tries way too hard. Some of the jokes are just cringey. It's like, we get it, you're trying to be funny and quirky, but it falls flat most of the time. Feels like they're trying to shove the laughs down your throat. The thing about ""Love Actually"" is, it's trying to sell this fairy-tale version of love, but it's so out of touch. It's like a bunch of unrealistic, soppy stories mashed together. And don't get me started on how it handles serious stuff like cheating. It's all glossed over with a cutesy bow. Visually, it's nothing special either. The whole thing just screams average. Sure, there are a couple of catchy songs, but that's not enough to save this trainwreck. So, in a nutshell, ""Love Actually"" is a hot mess. It's trying to be this big, warm-fuzzy, feel-good movie, but it's more like a cheesy, try-hard flick that's bitten off more than it can chew. If you're looking for a solid rom-com, this ain't it, chief."
Love Actually (2003),Over rated but its intentions are good,Finally watched this one about 20 years late ha ha. There are a selection of cameo parts from some superb actors and also a selection of hammy over done sequences too. Bill Nighy's character steals every scene he is in. It must be fun to play a terrible character like that. Emma Thompson is great in everyone of her scenes. Hugh Grant does his thing. If you like his work you probably saw this years ago. Colin Firth has a part as Jamie who somehow has an epiphany involving a woman who doesn't speak English at all. This leads to the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. They say love is inexplicable but that one is a real stretch. There was one couple who shouldn't have even been in the film at all. Just Judy and John are some kind of lighting stand-in's for porn although I had to read about that as it is not obvious what they are doing and not a job one ever knew even existed. Martine McCutcheon was a nice surprise although well known to others but not to me as I don't watch TV soaps. But she was funny and seemed like a real person. Liam Neeson is now so well identified with his fictional role in those nutbar films where he goes OTT crazy it is hard to even consider him as a grieving widower which is what he plays in this movie. Thank goodness for Bill Nighy who I think gets the tone exactly right. Cynicism with a sense of humour.
Home Alone (1990),Funny and creative,"This movie, about an eight-year-old troublemaker who must defend his home against a pair of burglars on Christmas Eve, is a great family movie! The story and the concept are silly, but yet so funny. We get to meet a lot of different characters where some of them are part of hilarious family dynamics. You can actually resonate with them, and that makes the movie much more enjoyable. Despite that this movie is packed with humor, it also manages to introduce individual struggles during Christmas times that makes it emotional, as well. The action and its evolving storyline are very entertaining because of its creativeness, and because of the movie's success, many scenes have become globally iconic, making the movie even more worthy. With its blend of heartwarming moments, hilarious antics, and creative action sequences, this movie is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of audiences worldwide."
Home Alone (1990),The Christmas movie,"""Home Alone"" is a heartwarming and hilarious family comedy that has stood the test of time since its release in 1990. Directed by Chris Columbus and featuring a stellar performance by Macaulay Culkin, this film has become a cherished part of the holiday season for audiences of all ages. The story follows 8-year-old Kevin McCallister, brilliantly portrayed by Culkin, who finds himself accidentally left behind when his family goes on vacation for Christmas. What follows is a delightful rollercoaster of slapstick humor and heartfelt moments as Kevin defends his home from two bumbling burglars. Culkin's charisma and comedic timing are undeniable, making Kevin a character audiences can't help but root for. The supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the burglars, adds an extra layer of humor to the film. The chemistry between the characters feels genuine, contributing to the movie's overall charm. One of the standout aspects of ""Home Alone"" is the cleverly crafted and memorable booby traps Kevin sets to thwart the burglars. These scenes are not only entertaining but also showcase the creativity of the filmmakers. John Hughes' screenplay strikes a perfect balance between humor and heart, creating a film that appeals to both children and adults. The movie's holiday setting adds to its timeless appeal, making it a must-watch during the festive season. In addition to its comedic brilliance, ""Home Alone"" also delivers a valuable message about the importance of family and the realization of one's own strengths. The film's feel-good factor is infectious and has made it a perennial favorite in households worldwide. In conclusion, ""Home Alone"" remains a classic that continues to bring joy to audiences decades after its release. Its combination of humor, heart, and memorable characters makes it a true holiday gem that deserves its status as a beloved cinematic tradition."
Home Alone (1990),The absolute Christmas movie,"The plot is fairly simple but provides a great foundation for an adventure full of laughs. Macaulay Culkin shines as brightly as it gets and is the main reason for the movie's success, while the duo of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern add the right amount of goofiness and showcase incredible chemistry. Excellent score by John Williams as well. However, specifics don't matter that much. The major achievement of this movie is that it perfectly captures the Christmas spirit, it's hard to imagine Christmas without Home Alone, watching it has become sort of a family tradition for me - and I know I'm not the only one. It's quite possibly the only movie I've watched so many times, yet it never gets old."
Home Alone (1990),31.12.2023 Five hours before the New Year...,"""Home Alone"" is already a New Year's classic. I am writing a review a few hours before the New Year 2024, the time is more suitable than ever! The film is a comedy, the action takes place, as it is clear, on Christmas Eve, the idea is quite original, the actors also did their job well. I also want to say that I am not an ardent fan of this movie and do not watch it every New Year, but it is worth recognizing the cult significance and overall interest of the plot of ""Home Alone"". I would recommend watching this movie at least once in a New Year's mood to feel the rush of the atmosphere. It's worth it! My rating : 7.5/10."
Home Alone (1990),"""I wish they would all just disappear.""","""Home Alone"" has definitely earned its place as a Christmas season viewing staple. I saw it years ago when it came out, that was before I started doing these reviews, so I caught it with the family the other night looking for something to watch. I didn't remember how mean the members of the McCallister family were to each other when the story opened, so that was somewhat off putting. But then things proceeded to the familiar story of young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) mistakenly left behind on a family vacation when Mom (Catherine O'Hara) inadvertently included a neighbor kid in the head count to start the trip. Most of the humor is provided by the bumbling intrusion of home invaders Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), who receive their comeuppance from Kevin to devastating effect more than once. Even with that, my favorite scene was the one with old neighbor Marley (Roberts Blossom) and Kevin discussing their fears while in the quiet setting of the church. It reminded me of all the worldly wisdom one could get from watching any episode of 'Leave it to Beaver'. And of course, you had not one, but two feel good endings with Kevin reuniting with his family, as well as Marley, who made up with his estranged son in time to enjoy the Christmas holiday."
Home Alone (1990),The magic diapered again,"A late merry Christmas from me, and I hope everyone had a nice Christmas in general. It's time to watch the same 5 movies as always because tradition, but let me be honest, I might skip this one next year. Home Alone is a concept that screams Chris Columbus, since it's an amazing child fantasy. He has always been the master of that, creating the scenarios that speak to an inner child in you, imagining that you, in this case, were home alone owning the house, doing whatever you wanted. But after rewatching it for the millionth time, the magic has worn off, as per usual when it comes to me and Columbus movies. Maybe it's me seeing more and more small things I don't like, and repeatedly seeing them just makes me want to skip to the best parts of the movie. This is still a movie I hold dear but for the future, it can run in the background. Kevin is a young boy in a big family, and after they forget to bring him for the Christmas getaway, he is left home alone. This is nice for Kevin, however some thieves might ruin this Christmas for him. What this movie drives on is its concept. It's the ultimate childhood dream to be left alone and do whatever you wanted to. Chris Columbus captures the childhood wonder and fun perfectly, and Macaulay Culkin´s kids charm carries the vision. Eating whatever you want, seeing whatever you want, fight off bad guys, it's a kid's wish come true. This together with the heart is incredible. The movie has these really heartfelt speeches and conversations and combines it with humor to really make a fully rounded movie. But I must admit, it feels like a slow movie, basically because it's a concept film before a plot one. The movie goes from scenario to scenario without much connection, and the loose storytelling just doesn't speak to me. I don't know what the movie tries to do half the time, and the first half doesn't really connect with the later The acting is also a bit all over the place. While the charm of Macaulay Culkin is wonderful in this movie, the over acting doesn't really speak to me, with very repetitive gags like the scream done too many times. The standout here is the acting of Joe Pesci and the comedic timing of Daniel Stern. The later physical comedy and the comedic parring of the two really carries this movie. Course, while I find it fun what Kevin is doing in the first half, I just wait for the house invasion. That is the best part of the movie, proving that physical comedy still is amazing when done to perfection. The score is pretty good, but that's no surprise coming from my favorite composer, John Williams. It is a bit all over the place, but so is the movie. He captures every emotion perfectly here. This is a good movie to me, but a lot of empty calories and just entertainment. It don't do more than that. As per usual when it domes to Chris Columbus movies, the concept, and its elements are childhood perfection and captures the essence of having fun as a kid, but creating a strong story and doing something with the concepts are always lacking. This is a classic, and I'll watch it again no doubt, but maybe from a distance next time."
Home Alone (1990),A Christmas Classic,"Oh, Home Alone. It's' a Christmas classic and for good reason. This film is a tale of two halves: the first is about a naughty boy who thinks his family disappeared, the second is the brutal beatdown that he gives to a couple of burglars. I find a lot of enjoyment during both parts of the narrative. Kevin's gradual regret about his ""Christmas wish"" is tender to watch, specifically when it comes to the relationship with his mother. The humor in this movie is phenomenal. From the destruction of Buzz's room to Kevin's quippy remarks at the grocery store,
Macaulay Culkin crushes his performance. Across the board, one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time, even though I like the 2nd one more. Best Character: Kevin
Best Quote: ""I'm gonna give you to the count of 10, to get your ugly, yella, no-good keister off my property before I pump your guts full of lead!"" - Johnny
Best Scene: Facing Harry and Marv
Best Piece of Score: ""Somewhere in my Memory"""
Home Alone (1990),Kevin McCallister is Obviously Training Himself to be Jigsaw,"While celebrating the holidays, classic Christmas films are a surefire way to set the mood and make spirits bright. Capturing the holiday cheer, Home Alone has been a definitive film of the season for over 30 years. With Macaulay Culkin taking on his most iconic role as Kevin McCallister, it is undeniable how charming and talented he is, especially for a child actor. Although the story is fun and entertaining, it is Kevin McCallister and the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) that elevate the film into its iconic level. While most of the film is fun, there are some slower bits in the middle, which separate the fast paced start and the exciting heist. With memorable performances, lots of laughs, and plenty of holiday heart, Home Alone is a fun film that consistently makes spirits bright."
Home Alone (1990),Crazy Christmas,"While movies about Christmas are typically happy and lighthearted in nature, I don't know if I'd classify Home Alone as one of them. The movie has a more serious premise than you would expect (if you've never seen it), but also some important messages that apply to your life. The film starts with a family named the McCallisters getting ready to fly to Europe in order to spend their Christmas in Paris. The youngest son of Kate and Peter McCallister is Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), who always seems to be getting into trouble. The night before their vacation, Kevin ruins dinner after fighting with his older brother Buzz, and his mother confines him to the attic as punishment. Kevin tells his mother he is tired of always being ridiculed, made fun of, and wishes his family would go away forever. His mom tells him to watch what he says, since it might just happen. That night, the alarm clocks in the house are shorted out due to a bad storm, causing the family to oversleep. Kate and Peter wake up in a panic, discovering they only have about 45 minutes to get on their plane. They hire rented vans to go to the airport, but in the rush, Kevin is left behind. The latter wakes up and realizes he has the house to himself. Kevin goes outside and is terrified of an old man named Marley, whom Buzz said is a serial killer. Soon, Kevin's house is set in the sights of two burglars, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern respectively) who attempt to rob empty houses around Christmas. Strangely, Harry was already in Kevin's house before his family went away, posing as a cop. As Harry and his accomplice try to scope out Kevin's house from a Dodge van, so Kevin uses mannequins and loud music to give the impression his family is still home. Concurrently, Kate realizes mid flight that she left her son at home. Once in France, she desperately tries to get a flight back to Chicago, but they're all full. Peter and Kevin's relatives stay in a hotel while Kate manages to get a plane to Pennsylvania. Once there, all the flights to Chicago are still full, but she meets a traveling band who offer to drive her there in a moving van. Back at Kevin's house, Harry and Marv find out he is the only person home, and put their plan of robbing the house into action. Kevin goes to a local church alone and comes face to face with Marley, who comes right up to him to wish him merry Christmas. Marley tells Kevin he came to the church to see his granddaughter sing in a choir, which he can't normally do as she is the child of a son who wants nothing to do with Marley. He and Kevin talk for a few minutes, and Kevin tells him he should try to make up with his son. Even if it doesn't work, at least he tried. When Kevin goes back home, he sets up makeshift traps all over the house to deter Harry and Marv, such as spreading ice all over the steps, shooting them with BB guns, and even putting Buzz's pet tarantula on them. As Harry and Marv chase Kevin through the house and up into the attic, he uses a zipline to get to a tree house in his backyard, then runs into a neighboring house. The criminals eventually catch Kevin, but Marley unexpectedly sneaks up on them and subdues them with a shovel. The cops show up and arrest Harry and Marv. Due to Marv's calling card of leaving the water running in every house they rob, the cops know all the houses they have broken into. On Christmas morning, Kevin wakes up, goes outside and learns his family is still away. Right after going back inside, Kate's U-Haul pulls up. Overjoyed at seeing her son again, the two of them forgive each other. Peter and the others then come back home after taking a flight that Kate didn't want to wait for. Kevin doesn't tell his family about what went on when they were away, then looks out his window to see Marley getting back together with his son and granddaughter. This is quite a nice movie. While Pesci and Culkin do have a tendency to overact, it's hard to imagine such a memorable movie with any other actors. Culkin's portrayal of Kevin is instantly relatable, even if you don't have siblings. We've all had to deal with animosity from family members even if we don't deserve it. I mentioned earlier that even though the movie may not appear that serious on the outside, it has many morals in it that you should think about all the time. Kevin telling Marley in the church about how he should see how his son is doing is a crucial moment, since it shows no matter what you did to someone in the past, you can always try to get back on their good side. Even if it doesn't work, you at least did something to try and fix the situation. Some people go their whole lives not talking to certain relatives because of one minor argument back in the 80s, and it's stupid. In addition, we see how unconditional the affection a parent has for their child is. Even though Kevin is left behind in the beginning by his irate mother, she is distraught throughout the rest of the film once she realizes what she did. Overall, because Home Alone has a great atmosphere and an unlikely protagonist in the form of a kid who manages to prevent two seasoned criminals from wrecking his house, I think it's an ideal thing to watch during the holidays (or any other time)."
Home Alone (1990),"It's funny, but hardly one that I'd revisit every year.","Not really about a merry Christmas, but a family so dislikeable that permanent holiday vacations from sounds like a jolly, jolly experience to me. Certainly Macauley Culkin is fun to watch, but he's definitely neglected which leads to brattiness and acting out. His older brother is one nasty piece of work, taking great pleasure in torturing him, and the worst part of it is that his parents let him get away with it. John Heard and Catherine O'Hara get the awards for the worst screen parents ever, and the assortment of annoying family members are just horrid. I rank this higher because in spite of all I abhorred about it, I did find a little bit of a heart, particularly with the scary neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who gets to reveal his own truth, making the viewer wonder about the scary neighbors of their own childhood. As the escaped convicts, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are dumber than Elmer Fudd and the coyote, and realistically, they should have been deceased after a few knocks on the noggin and other painful traps Kevin sets. As for him, he'd be in a juvenile detention center for the deadly dangerous. But try not to laugh about the shenanigans Culkin gets into. Everybody in 1990 did, and decades later, it's still considered a holiday perennial."
Dunki (2023),Dont waste your money,"I expected better of Raj kumar Hirani if not of SRK who started making mass films(which translates to bad films) after getting discouraged by failure at box office for Swades and Paheli 20 years back. He has continued his hit run of making corny and cringy movies and has even taken Tapsee and a great actor like Vicky Kausal to a level of bad acting that you wont belive they are capable of. In short the movie is a failed attempt to do justice to a serious issue and I thought it would have passed as just a run on the mill comedy if it wanted to be just that. But no, they had to bring the cringe. Omar no Hamar. Stay home. Save yourselves."
Dunki (2023),Not a Raju Hirani Epic!,"As my heading, it's not what you expect. I went to the cinema with great jubilation for this movie... especiallly because of how Rajkumar Hirani's movie are. Well, this one ""DUNKI"" typically disappointed me and the story kicked off after the second half. The stuggling journey wasn't even shown more deeply and it was just about 20mins of screen time. The challenging roads weren't more i would say and that really put me off. Also, SRK's acting wasn't top notch either.. Raju Hirani , you are more greater than this below average movie. I hope you make great movies in future. Totally disappointed."
Dunki (2023),A Good film with a hurriedly written ( changed?)screenplay,"While watching the film, one gets the feeling the makers felt the movie will not stand upto PK Munnabhai series so the climax was hurriedly written. The weakest part of the screenplay was how fast the main protagonist in the film could reach England. Indian immigrants come mostly on the invitation of hotel owners, shop keepers, and simply stay on by going off radar. However let's give Raju Hirani benefit of the doubt. Taapse fits in seamlessly with Shahrukh. Raju Hirani missed the chance of developing Vicky Kaushals character and developing it into a great one. Nevertheless Vicky does a fantastic job. Sad to see Boman Irani a regular in Raju Hirani's film given next to nothing role for such a talented actor. Songs were too loud and Pritam is losing his touch. Dunki is doing well because of Shahrukh Khan but people are not talking about it. You can give the movie a miss and watch it on TV. But it's not bad watch either. It's just the film has suffered due to a week screenplay."
Dunki (2023),Disappointing,"Raju Hirani films are so promising that they lure audiences blindly despite of any amount of disbelief shown by trailers or pre release hype. All primarily because of impeccable storytelling with great script and screenplay. Dunki is so contrasting that it doesn't even seem like RHF. Excellent performances with great music and colors but all without a script and engaging storytelling. No connection with a single character. Poor execution with even worse editing are the highlights of this movie. Pretty sure Aamir would have or may did outright reject this mess. Extremely disappointed with the team, hoping for a better movie next time."
Dunki (2023),"So, what's the message?","It was a long movie that you hope will end soon. The message was pretty confusing. More like, with zero logic. Should the rich countries let the world's poor into their countries just because they are poor? What will happen if India, a rather not-so-well-off country, opens its borders? The emotion part was completely missing. Couldn't connect with the actors. And, if you are not from Punjab, please don't speak Punjabi or in a Punjabi accent. Applies to SRK too. The jokes were pretty lame. A huge amount of time was wasted on English lessons. I was thinking of English-Winglish which was such a well-done movie. Except for Vicky Kaushal, none of the key actors impressed me much. The fake display of patriotism and forcefully injected emotions didn't work for me. The only part of the story that impressed me a bit was the last escape plot. Other than that, it was a waste of money and time."
Dunki (2023),Intriguing take on immigration,"A trio of friends has problems that only migrating to London can solve. Unfortunately, the British immigration system has made it impossible for the average person to get a visa. After many hair-brained plans fail, they take the only remaining option, illegally crossing many borders and entering Great Britain. This dramedy examines the reasons and lengths individuals will go to make a better life for themselves and their loved ones. The movie's characters make it a comedy, but the story is dramatic. The film is easy to watch and moves along quickly, with only a few song and dance sequences. The film is worth streaming when it is available."
Dunki (2023),An issue based family entertainer Film,"Watched 2 Film on New Year Dunki and Sam Bahadur. Review of Film
Dunki
A journey back home with lots of love, humour, friendship, patriotism and strong emotions. Renowned director Rajkumar Hirani has done a wonderful job with these emotions, especially in the second half which is portrayed very well and the climax brings tears to your eyes. The strongest point of this film is its portrayal of the immigration problem, which shows reality about their struggles, their feelings. How they get cheated by fraud agencies take advantage of their feelings, dreams and ignorance. In the dream of a better life, so many people lost their lives. And once they reach the land of their dreams, what a harsh reality they have to face, and perhaps this is also the weakest point. How many of those who are going to theaters in search of entertainment with popcorn are aware of these problems? Even if we know, how many people can feel it? Sometimes it is the responsibility of a good director/writer to spread the message, to make the public realize the issue, which is just a news to them. There are some technical flaws, it could have been done better, it may not be Hirani's best, but overall it is a really good film with good intentions. You will laugh and cry. Everyone has acted well, but among all these good actors, Vicky's small role and his acting have created an impact. Taapsee Pannu has portrayed her acting abilities with efficiency. Vikram Kochhar, Boman Irani, Anil Grover have acted with liveliness. SRK fans will enjoy seeing his phenomenal portrayal of someone who can die for his love, but can't lie, can't defame his country. Pritam's music was good but not extraordinary. The hall was filled with families, parents bringing their children after a long time without any hesitation. After so much violence, action drama, intimate scenes, toxic masculinity, in recent releases Bollywood finally brings a pure family drama to enjoy this festive season. So, all the best to the Team Hiani. My rating is 4 Star out of 5 Star."
Dunki (2023),Emotional Layers: Unveiling Manu Randhawan's Impact,"Tapsee Pannu did well playing young Manu Randhawan in the movie, but when the story jumped 25 years ahead, her acting as an older person didn't quite hit the mark. It was hard to believe Tapsee Pannu was genuinely an elderly character, and this affected the overall impact of the film. Even in a scene meant to be emotional, like her character's death, I couldn't help but be disappointed at Tapsee Pannu's acting instead of getting sentimental. Her acting skills while portraying elderly Manu Randhawan held the movie back from being as emotionally impactful as it could have been. Despite Tapsee Pannu facing some acting hurdles, there's a lot to love about the movie. The storytelling kept me hooked, and the songs makes you heart go lutt putt. Shah Rukh Khan nailed his character (as always) with his top-notch acting. And even though Vicky Kaushal doesn't have a lot of screentime, he sure knows how to tug at your heartstrings-I mean, he got me crying! Oh, and can we talk about those action scenes? Loved them! The underwater scene, the scene in the deserts of Iran, each one of them were splendid."
Dunki (2023),A Resonant Exploration of Dreams and Reality.,"""Dunki,"" a 2023 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film, stands as a testament to the enduring allure of quality cinema. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, this film not only captivates audiences with its unique storyline but also demonstrates the sustained interest in well-crafted movies, as evidenced by a nearly full theater 10 days post its release. Set against the backdrop of the ""donkey flight"" illegal immigration method, ""Dunki"" delves into the lives of a group of friends who seek a better life abroad but face the harsh realities of their decision. The narrative is a compelling mix of humor and poignant drama, reflecting the complexities and moral dilemmas of such a journey. The film's casting is a masterstroke, with Shah Rukh Khan, Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal, and Boman Irani delivering performances that are both authentic and powerful. Shah Rukh Khan, in particular, shines in a role that seems tailor-made for him, adding depth to the film's emotional core. Rajkumar Hirani's direction is flawless, maintaining a balance between the comedic elements and the grave subject at hand. His expertise in storytelling is evident in every scene, capturing the audience's imagination and empathy. The screenplay, co-written with Abhijat Joshi and Kanika Dhillon, is crisp and engaging, complementing Hirani's vision perfectly. The technical aspects of ""Dunki"" enhance its appeal. The editing is seamless, making for a smooth cinematic experience. The background score and songs, though not exceptionally memorable, fit well within the film's narrative fabric, enriching the emotional resonance of the story. ""Dunki"" is more than a film; it's a reflection of the dreams and struggles of individuals seeking a better life. It's a movie that resonates with audiences beyond the fans of Shah Rukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani. The film's ability to hold a nearly full theater 10 days after its release speaks volumes about its impact and the connection it has forged with its viewers. In summary, ""Dunki"" is a must-see film that beautifully blends drama, romance, and comedy. Its poignant storyline, stellar performances, and masterful direction make it a standout in contemporary Indian cinema. It's a film that not only entertains but also inspires reflection and empathy, leaving a lasting impression on its audience."
Dunki (2023),Pretty good,"I went to this movie two days after its release. I'm a big fan of SRK, so I really wanted to go. Here's what I liked and disliked about the movie. The movie had a really good soundtrack and it was nice to hear in the theater. The characters had good personalities and good reasons to go to London. I loved that Tapsee Pannu, an all around actress was there in the film. Sukhi(Vicky Kaushal)'s presence was so meaningful and I was sad to see him go. That leads me into what I disliked about the movie. Sukhi's funeral and Hardy(SRK) deciding to go to London by Dunki is what closed out the first half, which was a barrel of laughter and everyone in the theater including us was laughing so hard. The second half is their journey to London, so it got serious and went really slow that I wanted to sleep at one point. But that's how Raju sir's films are. To wrap things up, this was a good movie, and it was beautiful."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),Harmless Christmas Fun Bolstered by a Great Cast and Underrated Script,"As someone who is quite ""scroogish"" when it comes to Christmas movies - bah, mediocrity! - I recently took the chance to enjoy ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" for the second time. Surprisingly, it held up pretty well. Now, this needs to be immediately stated: your enjoyment of this movie will, quite simply, boil down to how much you can stomach Chevy Chase. Because, make no mistake about it, he is the main attraction here. From his patented physical comedy to his dry wit to his outlandish facial expressions (I'm particularly fond of the last one, in this movie), Chase has his paw marks all over this Jeremiah Chechik-directed romp. If you are a Chase fan, like I am (controversies aside), chances are you will be laughing from the opening scene to the final credits. Chase's delivery is on-point, and Clark Griswold, while very much a typical Chase character, is fun to laugh with (or at) for 90-ish minutes. The best laughs in this movie, though, come from the fantastic supporting cast. Whether you latch on to a young Juliette Lewis as Clark's moody teen daughter, Johnny Galecki as the mature (but young) Rusty Griswold, or the great E. G. Marshall as the elderly Art Smith, there are plenty of fun stocking stuffers to help elevate this film into ""classic"" territory. For me, however, it was the inclusion of Mae Questel (as Bethany) late in the film that had me belly-laughing on the couch. From her perfect delivery to fantastic lines (thanks, John Hughes), Bethany - despite having less than five minutes of screen time - is infectious. To make matters even better, her dynamic with her husband (William Hickey) is something that we can all relate to. Is this a deep movie that will have you sobbing due to introspection when the final credits roll? Nope. Are there some sub-par acting performances that take you out of it? Yep (looking at you, Brian Doyle-Murray). Is it the best Christmas movie ever made? Of course not. That being said, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation does enough (whilst minimally offending) to be considered a very good yule-related expedition."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),Celebrate Christmas with the Griswold family.,"First they drove across country to Wally World, then they won all expenses paid trip across Europe, now the Griswold family is staying home to host a good old fashioned family Christmas. Just like when the Griswold family hits the road, nothing ever really turns the way that Clark Griswold plans. From problems with the size of the Christmas tree to unexpected guests things go comically wrong. Joining Clark and his family are both his and Ellen's parents, Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany, and of course cousin Eddie and his bunch. There's a lot of slapstick humor and a lot of belly laughs provided by Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid in this mostly family friendly holiday favorite. This was my introduction to the ""Vacation"" series. I would've been only five when this came out, so I didn't see it until its network television premiere back in 1992, and it's been a favorite since."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),My favorite of the Vacation movies,"Not only is this my favorite of the National Lampoon Vacation movies, but it is also one of my favorite Christmas movies out there. For someone like myself, the other movies push it a bit ethically or morally, and even though this film is a little edgy, it is much for of a family film than the others in the series. Like a classic Christmas movie, everything goes wrong throughout, and its very entertaining. Todd and Margot are one of the funniest parts of this movie. Clark is funny as ever, and the whole family being under one roof is a great source of comedy. If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out."

National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),"Silly, Comedy Gold","A film that can be re-watched a few times and still be funny. Clark and the Griswalds are like every stereotypical American family during Christmas time, especially with the grumpy daughter and slightly troublesome son. The film is filled with comical comedy, largely lead by the father Clark Griswald and joined by his cousin in law Eddie when he shows up half way through the film as a surprise Christmas visit. The film is still filled with a few serious and touching moments such as Clark's work bonus for Christmas, and his care towards Eddies children making sure they get presents from Santa for Christmas. However, the film is largely represented by the comedy and some of it is golden to watch."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),My favourite,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a holiday classic that unwraps the gift of timeless comedy.

The film captures the relatable madness of holiday preparations, making it a seasonal favorite. Chevy Chase's impeccable comedic timing and the ensemble cast's brilliant performances deliver a sleigh full of laughter. Amid the mayhem, the movie beautifully touches on the true spirit of Christmas, emphasizing family bonds and the importance of cherishing moments together. The quirky characters, memorable quotes, and slapstick comedy ensure that Christmas Vacation remains a cherished tradition for families, providing an enduring dose of holiday cheer. It's a must-watch that embodies the perfect blend of humor and heart, making it a festive feast for the whole family."""
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),A Christmas Tradition.,"I watch this movie with the family every year in December before Christmas Eve. I must have seen this movie at least 15 times, and I'm still not tired of it. It is without a doubt the best Christmas movie, the best in the Vacation series, and the funniest. It's also one of my favorite comedies. The acting is good. The entire cast is fantastic. The dynamic is so good between all the actors/characters, but the best is Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold. I think there is a big difference compared to the other films. This movie is much better when it comes to acting, script, and humor. In this movie, the Griswold family does not go away on vacation. Instead, they stay at home and relatives come to their house to celebrate Christmas. That does not mean it will be less chaos, rather more. It escalates more and more, and Clark gets more and more crazy, which is so funny. Whatever he does, it ends up a disaster. He really tries, and you feel for him, while you just sit and laugh through the whole movie. Fantastic movie!"
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),Christmas Vacation Is A Blast.,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is one of the best Christmas movies ever made, and beloved by many. I know people who have traditions in watching it, like an elderly friend who used to watch it on Christmas Eve before going to bed. The movie follows Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) who hopes to have the perfect at home family Christmas. Unfortunately, a rodent in a tree, dry turkey, stapling lights to the house, being trapped in the attic, and an unexpected Christmas bonus is not what he had in mind. Christmas Vacation, as the movie is briefly called, is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever. This can be attriubited to John Hughes, who wrote the script, and who would write Home Alone a year later. There are many funny scenes in the movie, such as the ones mentioned above. The cast is also enjoyable- such as Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Mae Questel (aka Betty Boop), Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Doris Roberts, and EG Marshall- who actually passed away the very day that I was born. Probably due to the PG-13 rating (which comes from some sexual humor and a single F-bomb near the end of the movie), I didn't see this as a kid. However, in the last maybe 8 or 9 years, I have seen it quite a few times- maybe 5 or so times. I know that this review is pretty short, but this would be best enjoyed without much more detail. Just go watch it and have fun- it's a blast."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Chevy Chase as Clark Griswald is determined to have a traditional family Christmas and of course everything that can go wrong, does. Family members including the disgusting Cousin Eddie and various grumpy parents turn up whilst Clark attempts to pull a perfect holiday together with the support of his despairing wife and children who know that stubborn Clark must deliver whatever the cost. There are amusing scenes in this to be sure, particularly near the beginning around Christmas trees and lights which are quite fun, but it all soon becomes clumsy, over the top and relies too much on the use of Chase whose show it is, almost to the exclusion of everyone else. In the end it's a Chevy Chase centred mess with few original ideas."
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989),Literally the worst movie ever,"I remember liking this movie a bit when i was younger. However, after rewatching this today i can honestly say that i've never seen such a bad movie ever. It has NO story, everything is just incidents after incidents that are totally predictable. The only funny thing is some of the adult jokes... in the beginning. Then it becomes too much. I don't see the humor in a man in his 40s flirting with a 20yo in front of his son. I can't see the humor in ridiculing a poor family who lives in a trailer. I can't see how animal cruelty is funny?? It seems like the script was made in an hour- i feel like this could be an assignment made by some highschoolers in AV class. If you're wondering if it's worth spending 90 minutes watching this movie-- it's not. Spend it watching a movie with good characters, real humor, and some actual build-up stories. Or you'll sit there watching a movie with no connection to the characters and just annoyance."
A Christmas Story (1983),Heck Yeah!,"I'm 12 and when I was eight I loved this movie and I still do! It's a Christmas classic and a masterpiece for what it is. It's one of the most famous Christmas movies if not the most famous Christmas movie. It's characters are great and it's funny as heck. The main character is famous, the dads famous, the bully is really famous and heck the lamp is the most famous out of them all! I love the scene with Santa and I really love the scene with the lamp because it's hilarious. If I had to pick the biggest downside it would be the bullys little brother kinda thought he was annoying. Parents not to much to say but there is one scene with a little blood, infrequent language, implied f word although it says fudge instead. A Christmas masterpiece and a classic. 8/10."
A Christmas Story (1983),Similar to the Sandlot,"A Christmas Story was an amazing movie. A Christmas Story was a funny movie with lots of funny parts. This movie is an engaging movie with engaging characters. If Fffugde was replaced with the F word, then this movie would have been rated PG-13 ( or maybe R ). One thing I didn't understand was the two scenes after the scene when Ralphie had Christmas. It just didn't make sense to me why the existed. This movie was very similar to The Sandlot. The movies both had lots of mini stories in one movie and they were also set in the past. If you like the Sandlot, then I would reccomend this movie to you. What a great movie. In all, I would give this movie a 8.4 out of 10."
A Christmas Story (1983),A Christmas Story,"What can I say. The classic Christmas story. Everyone loves this move- how could you not. Every year I watch this film because it takes me back to my childhood. The innocence of the characters. The film is based around a young man who wants nothing for christmas but a bb gun, but all he hears from adults is that he will shoot his eye out! He goes through so many different schemes to try to get this done throughout the entire film. What I love about this film is the big focus on family and how everything is centered around him, his mom, dad and little brother. I love the traditional holiday values this film has."
A Christmas Story (1983),A Christmas Story (1983),"Cult Cuts Volume 47 (A RETURN TO THE VIDEO STORE CHRISTMAS 3) #4/4: A Christmas Story (1983) (7/10): If I'm being completely honest here, I'm not as high on this one as others are. A Christmas Story follows young Ralphie who is in your more traditional family and he is trying to get his parents to get him a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB Gun for Christmas and is having no luck. He is living with the ordeals of your average everyday kid; getting in trouble, wildly active imagination and the school bully. He tries coming up with multiple ways to get his Red Ryder BB Gun from attempts at subliminal messages to writing his school paper on it to asking the big man for it but all seem fruitless, will his Christmas wish come true? So I know that this is THE CHRISTMAS MOVIE for many people, but I'm just not as high on it as others are, and I think it's an excellent example of just how expectations being high from hype, because, yeah I don't think I mentioned that this is my first time seeing it. Although I do want to say that I don't dislike it in the slightest, I just don't love it either. The costumes are wonderful and so is the set design, they are filled with Christmas joy and spirit. Both Ralphie and his younger brother are likable in their own ways and you get a genuine sense of a bond between the two of them in how Ralphie helps him out and his brother is genuinely worried that dad will do something bad to Ralphie after he finds out about the fight he had with the bully. You get a strong sense of a somewhat dysfunctional family that truly cares for one another at the end of the day. One thing that I found that also didn't help with my thoughts on it is that, for a Christmas comedy, I only laughed legitimately once, and that was at the end when they were having Chinese Turkey and the employees kept screwing up the carols due to their accent. Bob Clark did a fantastic job with his second Christmas film however I still prefer his first, I just like the less is more approach and also I do want to make it clear that it doesn't just get brownie points for being my favourite genre, but I'll get into why I like it much more when I cover it here pretty soon. A Christmas Story is a classic and deserving of its place but it is just not that much my kind of thing."
A Christmas Story (1983),The best!,"This film is absolutely hilarious EVERY TIME. There are a lot of really weird negative reviews. Take things too seriously much, people? Sheesh. Just relax. The movie is set in the 1940s and was made in the early 1980s. Both were different times. Humor was different. Special effects were different. The acting is delightfully, hopefully, deliriously over-the-top. The mom's facial expressions are glorious. Ralphie's dream of the fun is timeless-we've all had a similar want that we were told was bad for us. Randy is so funny-nothing better than the scene where he is all bundled up. And their dad is adorably daft. This movie isn't for everyone, I guess, but the excessive ""analysis"" (if one can call it that) is ridiculous."
A Christmas Story (1983),A funny and heartwarming story.,"We love a good Christmas film here, but this one seems to have passed us by until now. We watched it last night with a bottle of wine and really enjoyed it. Very funny in parts, and with a warm and affectionate atmosphere throughout, it knocks more modern efforts for six. Darren McGavin is on top form as Dad and in fact everyone is just great. I love the way everyone in town tells Ralphie he'll 'shoot his eye out' if he gets the BB gun for Christmas, and he very nearly does! And of coures there are the local trouble-causers who get their just rewards as must always be the case. If you haven't seen this, go get it."
A Christmas Story (1983),"""You'll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid.""","A Christmas Story is one of the most beloved Christmas movies ever made, and rightfully so. It's funny, quotable, and simply so entertaining that it deserves the acclaim that it has had these last 40 years. The story being told is narrated by a man named Ralphie, who is reminiscing on the best Christmas he ever had- in which he desired a Red Ryder BB Gun more than anything. Unfortunately, his Mom, teacher, and even a mall Santa tell him no, because he'll shoot his eye out. In between Ralphie's quest to get his gun, there are iconic scenes in which a friend of his sticks his tongue to a frozen pole, Ralphie gets a bar of soap for swearing, his Dad wins a sexy lamp as an award, and more. These iconic scenes are part of the charm that the movie has. There are also famous quotes, like ""You'll shoot your eye out"", ""Fra-jeel-ay...it must be Italian!"", ""Ovaltine? A crummy commercial?"" and ""I triple dog dare you!"" But apart from famous lines and scenes, there is other merit to A Christmas Story as well. One prime example is the actors who do great work- Peter Billingsley as Ralphie, Darren McGavin as The Old Man, Melinda Dillon as Raphie's Mom, Scott Swartz as Flick, and so forth. There's more that I feel like sharing, but I am worried about spoiling too much of the plot. When I was really little, I was aware of this movie's existence and wanted to see it, but my Mom thought I was too young for it since it revolves around wanting a gun and it had quite a bit of swearing. Luckily, I have had plenty of time in my teen and adult years to see it, in fact I have now seen it over a dozen times- it's that enjoyable. If your kid is under 8, that may be a little young for them to see A Christmas Story. Otherwise, this would be a great movie for families. Even 4 decades later, this still manages to charm and entertain audiences, and there is good reason. It's a holiday treasure."
A Christmas Story (1983),Xmas tradition in this family,"Seen this a thousand times and I'll watch it a thousand more, every year Xmas readily with my wife and boy, it's classic. A Xmas tale told through the eyes of a child and his one wish: a Red Ryder a BB gun. The build up to Xmas is filled with different plot points that mesh together beautifully, delivered by a fantastic cast of characters each with their own arcs and stories, truly one of the best Xmas movies ever. From the opening monologue to the ending scene you are transported back to a simpler time, filled with attention to detail and on location, this flick captures the essence of childhood innocence and Xmas miracles: Santa knows, Santa always knows."
A Christmas Story (1983),40 Years of Pop Culture Celebration,"40 years ago, humorist and storyteller Jean Shepherd's book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash was adapted for the screen in the form of A Christmas Story. While only a modest hit during its November 1983 release, the film would become a cult favorite over the years thanks to numerous television airings, thus leading to stage adaptations, a followup in 1994, two later day sequels in 2012 and 2022 respectfully, and a culturally significant place in the National Film Registry. So with this film having reached its 40th anniversary this year, its status remains more important than its overall quality. Now the story of youngster Ralphie Parker dreaming of his ideal Christmas gift, a ""Red Ryder air rifle."", is a story many people can relate to when it comes to struggling to keep one's hopes intact. As Ralphie has to put up with his cranky dad's odd choices and disgruntlement from school enemies like his teacher and rival bully Scut Farkus, Shepherd, co-writer Leigh Brown and director Bob Clark incorporate a melancholy feel of childhood curiosity not often seen in films today. Admittedly, perhaps the film favors its humorous setups a bit too much from its main plot since the film can often lose momentum in going from one comedic / dramatic scene to another. Most of these scenes are intended to develop Ralphie to do better, especially around his doting mother and little brother Randy, but they merely serve their purpose to the point where it mainly feels like we're watching school lessons instead of a fully realized movie. Also, the addition of certain characters like Farkus and Ralphie's school friends aren't as impactful as they could have been, although it certainly isn't all about them. Perhaps where the film succeeds the most is in Ralphie's imaginative scenarios, complete with absurd acting and fast paced editing techniques. As ludicrous as they can get, they capture the imagination any child could have in interpreting what could happen to them before they experience something in reality. In contrast to Shepherd's humorous narration as grown up Ralphie looking back on most of the scenarios, Peter Billingsley brings young Ralphie to life through genuine emotion and sly wit, arguably more so than a lot of the other child actors who are nonetheless as funny to watch as they are obnoxious. The addition of holiday themed music and merchandising further adds to the overwhelming nature one can see around the Christmas season, whether in rural Indiana or somewhere else. Arguably more memorable than composers Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer's original music, seeing adults and children throughout the film could make anyone watching feel welcome in the holiday spirit. As absurd as the film is conceptually, its heart is still in the right place. So while A Christmas Story's narrative doesn't flow all that well due to favoring its humor over its story, it nonetheless offers just enough charming performances, witty scenarios and heartfelt holiday cheer for some amusement. Unless you're fed up with all of the film's popularity, I would say check this out at least once this Christmas season. It's by no means for everybody, but it does capture the cherished and not so cherished memories of childhood that we often don't see in film that much anymore. Besides, it's not like you'll shoot your eye out by watching this movie or anything like that."
A Christmas Story (1983),A timeless Christmas classic!,"Last night, I went to see A Christmas Story, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, at my local theater. And I can tell you this: whether you see it on the big screen, or in the comforts of your own home (as me and my family have done for years), it is a wonderful movie! Set in the fictitious town of Hohman, Indiana at Christmastime 1940, A Christmas Story centers on 9-year-old Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants just one thing for Christmas: a Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. But everyone he talks about it to, from his mom (Melinda Dillon) to his teacher, to even Santa at Higbee's, gives him the same response: ""You'll shoot your eye out."" Thanks in part to writer Jean Shepherd's brilliant narration as adult Ralphie, the movie has fabulous worldbuilding, and really fleshes out all the characters; especially Ralphie and his family. One thing that makes this movie timeless is that Ralphie and his family and the people they interact with don't feel like old-fashioned people; they feel like people we know even now. In particular, the sibling energy between Ralphie and his little brother Randy (Ian Petrella) reminds me of how my older brother and I acted toward each other as kids. Likewise, the acting is brilliant in this movie! As Ralphie, Peter Billingsley demonstrates remarkable talent, even for the age of 9. Ian Petrella plays Randy like the most realistic 6-year-old you'd ever meet in your life. But the two that stand out are Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin (may he rest in peace) as Ralphie's parents. Their back-and-forth is truly magical. Darren McGavin, in particular is hilarious as Ralphie's old man. The movie also has a fabulous script, comedy and such memorable scenes and quotes. The banters between Ralphie's two best friends, Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R. D. Robb), are super entertaining, especially the scene where Flick is triple-dog dared by Schwartz to stick his tongue on the school flagpole, goes through with it, and ends up with a bandaged tongue. There's also the storyline regarding the old man's ""major award"", the famous leg lamp. Other highlights include Ralphie getting a bar of soap in his mouth for saying a dirty word (""Ohhhhhh, ffffffuuuuuuuudge!"" ""Only I didn't say fudge."" HA!), the old man beating on the faulty furnace while swearing in gibberish, Ralphie's melodramatic fantasies, Ralphie beating bully Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) senseless while cursing up a storm, and let's NOT forget the truly brilliant scene of Ralphie visiting Higbee's Santa. That is indeed, as Roger Ebert said, the best department store Santa visit ever captured on film! And whenever we get a Christmas tree every year, my brother and I always quote the Christmas tree salesman: ""Now, HERE'S a tree! This here is a TREE!"" And last but not least, there's the music. True to form, Paul Zaza and Carl Zittrer wove some classic Christmas tunes into this movie's score. They also perfectly chose all the songs to use! All in all, A Christmas Story is a fabulous Christmas movie that will never age! In fact, I consider it one of THE movies to watch around Christmastime!"
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),Jim Carrey masterclass,How the grinch stole Christmas would be utter rubbish without Jim carrey as the rest of the film is not the best. (If you complain about the town or characters looking weird that is how dr Seuss would have wanted it. The story is just the book and is represented well with a good explanation at why the grinch hates everything about Christmas. Sadly the rest of the film is not the best as annoying characters like Cindy Lou who kind of ruin the film. Overall How the grinch stole Christmas would never be any better rated because it feels cheap for some reason. That is why this film held up by a Jim Carey masterclass is a. 7/10 = good fun filled Christmas film.
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),The true meaning of Christmas,"Although you may not believe it, 23 years after this movie was made, I had never seen it, obviously I knew about the character but I only knew that he hated Christmas. I didn't really know the true meaning of the movie, and I think we've all been the Grinch at some point, especially given how the world is today. If it strikes me how 23 years later the film still has the same meaning, how the true meaning of Christmas is forgotten and how it has become a commercial era, a superficial era, based on consumerism. Taylor Momsen really plays a very good character, she and the Grinch with the soul of the film, without forgetting Max too, Cindy reminds us of the innocence of children, without malice, they see the good side of people, always obviously being a reflection From the upbringing that has been given, she reminds us that everyone deserves to be accepted, that everyone deserves to be accompanied at Christmas. I liked knowing the story of the Grinch, about his childhood, about how bullying caused him consequences. Although it is a film whose target audience is children, it really generates a lot of reflection. For the time, the makeup and costumes were spectacular, they won an Oscar for a reason. And Jim Carrey's performance as the Grinch is very good. I think it is a film that as one grows or depending on the stage of life in which one sees it, it will generate a different meaning and reflection."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),Another Grumpy Green Recluse,"Adapting Dr. Seuss' classic holiday children's book, How the Grinch Stole Christmas brings the not-so jolly green giant to the big screen. Giving a deeper backstory to the characters and some additional elements to the story, we get a more connected journey, with a lot of heart. Jim Carrey creates one of his most iconic roles, as the Grinch's quirkiest qualities are accentuated in some of the most entertaining ways. A lot of the comedy still holds up, but some of the jokes fall flat with time and remind you that this is a children's film. Whoville stuns with a spectacularly adorable town, looking as if it were directly ripped from a Dr. Seuss story and put on the screen. Accompanied by the delightfully wonderful 'Where Are You Christmas?', the infectious holiday cheer will follow you long after you've watched this movie. Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas will always remain a holiday must-watch and, even with its imperfections, it reminds us that the deeper qualities are what matter most."

 Family Christmas Fantasy Comedy Financial Success The film is an adaptation of the 1957 book of the same name, starring Jim Carrey as the Grinch, a green monster residing atop a mountain near the town of Whoville. A family-oriented Christmas fantasy with a touch of comedy, Jim Carrey carries the film, though his experience in the Grinch costume was reportedly dreadful. Director Ron Howard strives for the stylized chaos of Frank Tashlin and Tim Burton but leans more towards the visually overwhelming style of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. He pits Carrey against the grotesque rat-faced mole-people of Whoville. The plot is present but not particularly strong."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),A timeless classic,"""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences of all ages. Dr. Seuss' whimsical tale comes to life with enchanting animation, heartwarming moments, and a valuable message about the true meaning of Christmas. The Grinch's journey from a holiday cynic to discovering the joy of giving is beautifully depicted, and the iconic narration by Boris Karloff adds a magical touch. This festive film is a must-watch during the holiday season, delivering laughter, warmth, and the spirit of Christmas in abundance. Jim Carrey, Taylor Momsen, Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor are all simply amazing!"
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),First world problems,"This is such an amazing performance by Jim Carry. The film is nostalgic and without the comedy why would there be need to make this movie? If you like the cartoon stick to that. This movie is so underrated and the costume and make up is outstanding! Lots of feels when I see this movie every year for the holidays. All the negative reviews are from boomers who are very vanilla and have no flavor. It's a cute movie and recommend for those who need a laugh, a time to feel nostalgia, and to bring Christmas cheer into your spirits. Lots of great memories made with this film. I imagine Seuss would appreciate the performance and storyline."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),Best Holiday movie ever,"This movie is a masterpiece. Jim Carreys performance as the Grinch is iconic. The set pieces are so incredible that there's still being replicated at universal studios The use of practical effects and prosthetics is just amazing. I really not sure what kind of person wouldn't like this movie, unless you're a greedy CEO type that hates the idea of people diminishing the value of blatant commercialism in holiday spirit. Our family's holiday season is just not complete without a viewing of this Christmas classic. Although I'm not really one for musical numbers, I also find several of the original pieces in this movie to be very well done."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),A fun affair for the kids,"Now in no way am I dissing this Movie. First up, Carrey is undeniably fantastic in the title role and I really struggle to see who else could have played the part better. The costumes look amazing and are undeniably Suess. For me the reason I have only scored 6 is that I find Suess to be quite difficult to get on board with. I appreciate it for what it is . But don't quite have the attraction to it that it seems to demand from an enormous following. I think my biggest gripe is that the beauty of Suess is the clever writing and rhyming and this seems to take second place in the live action affair. Don't get me wrong it's a well made family flick and I'd suggest younger kids will love it. It just isn't high on the list for me when it comes to the xmas watchlist. A middle of the road attempt which remains enjoyable without being captivating."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),Best Christmas Memories!,"Me and my family have only the best memories surrounding the Grinch. First in the animated class when I was a small child and than this fantastic version with Jim. It made my childhood memories complete and I know it did for my brother Erik too. We just felt genuinely connected to Dr. Seuss through this movie and also the cartoon movie. Jim Carrey really brought to life The Grinch and his stubborn mean heart, but how it could love once again and I think that happens to a lot of us in our hearts! It's the story of renewal and forgiveness. It's amazing God's love. Just remember we were ok born on Earth in order to LOVE GOD."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000),Terrible,"It's hard to find anything good about this lousy remake of Boris Karloff's beloved take on Dr. Suess' Grinch. Jim Carrey's over-acting and near duplication of his character in ""The Mask"" is painful to watch. The make-up used to create the Whos is simply grotesque and conjurs nothing of the whimsy of Dr. Suess' imagination stimulating artwork. Rather, it is more reminiscent of plastic surgery gone horribly wrong. The plot takes a decidedly political turn by ignoring the original innocence and moral steadfastness of Suess' Whos. Instead, the story is turned on end with the Whos presented as self-serving capitalists drowning in their over-consumption. Bottom line: this version of The Grinch is a far cry from the original, and more the stuff of nightmares than visions of sugar plums. Bag the remake and enjoy the original for a warm Christmastide tale of love and redemption."
The Holdovers (2023),A modern Christmas classic.,"Alexander Payne's 'The Holdovers' is a modern Christmas classic. An up to no good student, a strict and miserable teacher, and a grieving cook, are all stuck together in the school district for the entirety of the Christmas break in which they are forced to sleep, eat, and spend time together. This movie is about socializing, coming together with people, and most importantly, the fact that it is much better to love than to hate and a lot of us need to learn that. Whilst there is a lot more to this movie when it comes to the deeper meaning, I like to think of it as a visual representation as to why we should love and not hate. It's too often that we come to hate others when we don't even give ourselves a chance to love them. Alexander Payne did a wonderful job with this film. Though it is not the most original, the way he presents actions, words, even outside of the actors, it is very refreshing and unique and gives a feeling of originality and gives the feeling every classic does. No scene is wasted and Payne makes sure that each scene progresses the plot or delves further into each character in one way or another. Payne makes this film very heartwarming despite majority of it being conflict and arguing. The screenplay, whilst not completely and totally original, has a charm to it that any classic Christmas movie should and does have. The way each character is treated and how they treat each other creates a dynamic not only for the film but for the audience as well. Each scene brings us something new but also something that we are familiar with and it gives us comfort whilst also taking us out of our seat and not letting us get bored. Something I also love about the screenplay is the ending which is not left completely neat and perfect and only leaves the audience just satisfied enough to be content with it. And the fact that this film is far from predictable is brilliant as well, there came many times where I thought of one common and predictable way the next scene or sequence could go about and the screenplay would head in a totally different direction. The performances are all great, each do their fair share and each deliver exactly what and how they need to. Paul Giamatti specifically is brilliant in this film, the way he handles his characters temper, lack of emotions, and moods, is terrific. All is very well handled when it comes to the performances. The cinematography and production design only further develop the Christmas charm and warmth of the film. The production design gives a very grand feel at times whilst also keeping it realistic and down to earth with what was in any 1970s school. The visuals are not showy, nothing out of this world, and nothing to specifically catch the eye except for what it is representing for the film. I don't believe the cinematography needed to be necessarily special because the film is special enough as it is and that's the eye catching it has. The Christmas and warm feel that this film is translates through the visuals and production design and that's all that is really needed. The Holdovers most definitely deserves a watch and rewatch at that. A brilliant film about overcoming hate for love."

The Holdovers (2023),What a great film!,The Holdovers was a near perfect film for me. The perfect film for the whole entire family to watch during the Holidays. Paul Giamatti puts on an outstanding performance here and how he interacts with the students that he has to watch over is bith comedic and serious. This movie is a comedy drama and balances everything very nicely. I think what works best in this film is the chemistry between all of the characters and the situations they find themselves in. Also the dialogue is very sharp here and is a standout in this movie. I would say that the Holdovers is one of the top movies of 2023. The Holdovers gets a near perfect 9 stars out of 10 from me.
The Holdovers (2023),A True Holiday Classic,"This will put you in the mood of true Christmas nostalgia! Giamatti is Giamatti but Da' Vine Joy is truly a theatrical gem. Brilliantly executed from beginning to end. Memories of watching the classics during the holidays when we had Beta VHS. Love to walk away from cinema feeling a flood of emotions and this one never disappoints. ""There's nothing new in human experience Mr. Tully! Each generation thinks it invented debauchery or suffering or rebellion, but man's every impulse and appetite from the disgusting to the sublime is on display right here all around you. ...If you truly want to understand the present of yourself, you must begin in the past."""
The Holdovers (2023),Novice film writer knows how to create a beautiful film from a well-known concept thanks to good acting.,"The Holdovers is a new drama comedy directed by Alexander Payne, director of About Schmidt and The Descendants. In 1970, history teacher Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti) stays at school during the Christmas holidays. Here he is with some staff and students, who have nowhere else to go during the holidays. Paul tries to keep order among the people at school. After a few days, he is left alone with student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) and chef Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). During their isolating state, the three get to know each other well. In this way they try to help each other with their problems and past. This entire film was shot in real practical locations of a school in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, during a holiday so the school was empty. For example, no film sets or soundstages were used for this film. This gives the film a realistic look and feel while watching. Writer David Hemingson, who is better known as a writer of various TV series, has managed to write a good story with this story. He uses well-known concepts where different characters unintentionally end up together, but knows how to incorporate the characters well into the film. During the film, the characters get to know each other better and discover what bothers them or what they love. Together they try to help each other with their passions or annoyances. As a viewer, you sympathize more and more with the characters as you learn more about them. What also makes you care about the characters is the acting of the three actors in the film. Paul Giamatti comes across well as a more grumpy loner, but throughout the film you learn why his character has become this way and that there is still a good and kind person inside him. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's character also has her mysterious storylines, but serves more as someone who tries to maintain order and balance between a grumpy teacher and problematic student. This was only Dominic Sessa's first acting role, but this is not reflected in his performance in the film. He may not have known how to use a rotary telephone, but this is more due to his young age. He also knows how to deliver heart-warming acting for characters with a less than ideal past. Together the three actors know how to provide good acting, characters that you as a viewer start to care about and empathize with more and more during the film."
The Holdovers (2023),Fantastic attention to a time period,"The performance in this from Giamatti is outstanding. However, what really captivated me was the atmosphere of the time period. It is EXCEPTIONALLY rare in 2023/24 to see a historical-based film that adheres to the actual time period it is depicting. That alone gained a couple star here. The entire film ""feels"" like the 1960/70s. It isn't littered with altered dialog to conform to current social demands.. it come across as an honest portrayal of the time period - which few productions even attempt today. Overall the film is a slow grind about a relationship. It's entirely human interest. While I was engaged the entire film, and don't regret spending the time to watch this, it's not something overly memorable on the whole. But still.. it's worth watching if you are in the mood for a relatively subtle feel-good story. The biggest downside for me was the soundtrack.... it seemed honest to the time period - being more ""soft rock"" or ""lazy stoner"" tunes of the time period, nothing which conveys any excitement or interest.. more somber music in general. You know, the type of music that makes one think the performer may be half asleep or loaded up on mood suppressors. But, admittedly, I may have noticed it more because I find such music mildly irritating. So minus a couple stars because there's no repeat viewing aspect or takeaway memory from the film. And minus another due to the morose soundtrack."
The Holdovers (2023),A new Christmas movie for those so inclined,"I tend to avoid holiday movies due to a troubled upbringing as they always make me sad. I really didn't know that this was a holiday movie or at least I hadn't thought it through since it takes place around Christmas and a, duh, Christmas school break. So there I was in the midst of this movie when it suddenly hit me it was a Christmas movie! In any event it's a nice movie with a nice cast of three individuals played by the always good Paul Giamatti as a disliked teacher, the strong film debut of Dominic Sessa as a disliked student and Da'Vine Joy Randolph who is just about guaranteed an Oscar for this when the nominations and awards come out in the coming months. She plays the school's head cook stuck with the other two over the Christmas holidays. This is primarily about the sour relationship between the teacher and student growing warmer and warmer and both learning how to be better people. Alexander Payne is a fine director and writer, though he did not write this somewhat manipulative piece and I wish he had. It might have been a bit more sharp than sentimental. Still, it's good and there are many who will appreciate this a lot."
The Holdovers (2023),Two hours of my life I will never be able to regain!,"How this movie gets such a high rating is beyond me. The dialog is poor. The story is as boring as can be. I feel this movie could have been condensed into a 5 minute short. There is literally no character building. The acting is sub standard. By all. In fact I feel the timing between the actors seems forced. Let me break down my thoughts on some of the characters. The Kountz character was idiotic. I am still wondering if that was suposed to be the humour in the show but what the hell. The young Korean chap peeing in his bed was SO badly dealt with. Including the completely unconvincing empathy from Tully. As for Tully, why on earh do movie producers cast actors who look wayyy too old for their roles? His role/acting left much to be desired. This is not a cming of age movie. It is a dreary, lacklustre waste of time!"
The Holdovers (2023),Heartwarming,"Paul Hunham is teaching at an exclusive boys school, Barton Academy. It is set in the late 1969-70, and the students are mainly privileged sons of wealthy parents, and often spoiled. Paul teaches ancient history, and is well versed. But he is not a people person. He doesn't change with the times, and as a result is disliked by his students and the other teachers. Yes, he is terrified of losing his job. He gives his students no slack, which is difficult for the school, as those parents expect their sons to get an easy ride to top universities, so they can avoid the draft. It is the time of the war in Vietnam and the draft, and keeping in college means keeping out of the military. There is the regular Holiday break, but a handful of students can't leave, so Paul is set to be the 'babysitter' and one especially difficult student is Angus Tully. Tully has been expelled from three other schools and the next step for him is a military school. Paul expects to run the holiday as if it were a regular school period, which becomes even harder when all but Tully get a chance to leave. With them is Mary, the school cook and a black woman whose son was recently killed in Vietnam. And she loves cigarettes. So together these three stranded persons have to deal with each other, and they have their own set of problems. And how that can work out is really the heart of the movie, and very human."
The Holdovers (2023),Really lovely movie,"This was the perfect movie to watch during the holidays. I found all three main characters, Paul Hunham, Angus Tully, and Mary Lamb really fascinating. At first the movie starts with what feels like a teen drama, focusing on the interpersonal issues between Tully and the other holdovers, but this shifts when the rest of the crew are invited to on a ski trip and leave the punishing experience of Hunham's supervision quickly. This leaves behind Mary, Tully, and Hunham, who then form a sort of family between them. Hunham shows compassion and then bravey for standing up for Tully, and truly transforms as a character into someone I would love to follow their story. The cinematography is lovely, pacing is good, and plotline is easy-to-follow and feels natural. Would definitely recommend this one!"
White Christmas (1954),Beat Christmas film,"I watch this film every Christmas Eve and it is not only a great Christmas film, it is one of my favourite films of all time. Wallace and Davis meet the Haynes sisters and by twist of fate end up in a Vermont ski lodge owned by their old army General. There is no snow so they decide to help out by bringing their show there. Through a series of misunderstandings and mishaps there is a brilliant love story. Will there be a white Christmas by the end? Watch and find out. The musical numbers are so much fun and the comedy is brought by Danny Kaye. Harmless and brilliant fun, this film makes me feel really Christmassy every time I watch it."
White Christmas (1954),Saved from Oblivion by One Song,"Sentimental feelgood Christmas-themed comedies, so common today, were surprisingly thin on the ground in the fifties, even though there had been quite a few during the forties. (Hollywood evidently felt that people needed cheering up during and immediately after the war). ""White Christmas"" is one of the few exceptions. It borrows its title from that of a song in one of those forties films, ""Holiday Inn"". It is not, however, a remake of the earlier film, although both feature that song and both have the same star, Bing Crosby. During my childhood, my grandparents and others of their generation were always harping on the ""fact"" that in their younger days winters were much colder and summers much hotter, a ""fact"" which probably derived more from selective memory than it did from an accurate study of meteorological records. The song shows that nostalgia for the extreme weather of one's younger days was going strong even in the forties and fifties; frustrated by the mild winters of the present day, the singer can only dream of white Christmases like those he knew and enjoyed at some unspecified time in the past. So how do you make a film out of this concept? Bob Wallace and Phil Davis are two wartime army pals who after the war team up as a song-and-dance team. They decide to spend one Christmas in Vermont with their girlfriends, two sisters named Betty and Judy, and find that the hotel where they are staying is owned by their former commanding officer, General Tom Waverly. Waverly's hotel is not doing well, and he needs a successful Christmas season in order to stay in business. Unfortunately, however, the tourists are staying away because Vermont has been hit by unseasonably warm weather. Bob and Phil decide to stage a show at the hotel for the General's benefit and put out an appeal for all their old Army comrades to come and watch it. Finally, Bob belts out a chorus of ""White Christmas"" and- SPOILER ALERT!- Vermont is covered by a white blanket as the snow falls. And that's really it. It's not much of a plot, something that was commented on by a number of leading critics at the time, even though the film was a box-office success. (It was the biggest-grossing film of 1954). It was even commented on by Fred Astaire, Crosby's co-star in ""Holiday Inn"", who was offered the part of Phil but turned it down because he didn't like the script. The part then went to Donald O'Connor, and finally to Danny Kaye after O'Connor was taken ill. Crosby and Kaye were both talented comics, but the film doesn't really allow them much scope to demonstrate this side of their talents. Like ""Holiday Inn"", the film includes a ""minstrel number"", but unlike the equivalent scene in the earlier film this is not performed in blackface; perhaps people were starting to have doubts about this practice as early as 1954. The song-and-dance side of the film is rather better, with some well choreographed numbers showing off the talents of Kaye and Vera-Ellen. Vera-Ellen joins forces with Rosemary Clooney to perform ""Sisters"", probably the film's second-best-known song. (Vera-Ellen's voice was dubbed; she was hired mostly for her dancing talents). As for the title song itself, I must admit that I've never really liked it. (Too sentimental for my tastes). Nevertheless, I must admit that it has become a great favourite of many people, so much so that it has become a sort of secular Christmas carol, played endlessly on the radio (and on every shop's muzak track) every Yuletide. Indeed, it is probably this song which ensures that ""White Christmas"" the movie, which otherwise might have sunk without trace into oblivion, still turns up at least once during the television Christmas schedules every year. 5/10."
White Christmas (1954),One of the best movies ever!,"One of the best Christmas movies ever released! Great cast, music, dance, and a great storyline. I don't know if it's a spinoff from Holiday Inn, but they are both similar, with some of the same cast and music set 12 years apart. Very typical of show business people sadly deserting, changing, or leaving partners without notice and hurting each other only to forgive them as though nothing happened. For a Christmas story, it amazingly plays well. The snow showing up on Christmas eve was an important part of the movie, but it wasn't as important as the movie made it out to be except to the title song. Still, they don't make good Christmas movies like this anymore or good movies at all! It would be nice if someone designed a new movie around a good movie like this, in order to produce a real, well-produced movie again for a new America without good productions."
White Christmas (1954),One of my favorites!,"Christmas doesn't begin for me until White Christmas is on. This movie is one of my all-time favorites! Even if it's not Christmas. You can't beat the songs and Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney's voices, the actors, dancing of Danny Kaye and Vera Miles, or the touching story line. The scenery is beautiful from the opening in the camp behind the battle lines to the final snow falling setting. Edith Head is a masterful, as always in her costume creations, right down to Danny Kaye's blue dancing shoes on the bridge and masterful design to flatter all four of the main characters builds and still keep the outfits matching."
White Christmas (1954),Not great,"I'm a sucker for old movies. This ain't one of them. Bing Crosby seemed tired and old. Danny Kaye seemed to be trying to make up for Bing's lacklustre performance. The ladies did their best (I guess??). Was this a musical or a dance movie? Awful on both counts. What was with the dancing scene in purple? I get they are trying to showcase the dances but ???? Why? The story is flimsy, no chemistry with any of the characters. Steer clear and go to Its a Wonderful life instead. That movie has heart and a proper story. Maybe even check out Diehard. At least that has a more believable storyline. What a total disappointment of a movie."
White Christmas (1954),FAVE CHRISTMAS MOVIE,"This is my all-time favorite movie for the holidays. I used to watch it with my mom every year at Christmas time, usually several times through the season. I try to see it every year at Christmas time. Unfortunately, I'm stuck living in my vehicle, and don't have access to it. I wish it was available on Disney+ or Hulu, instead of only on Netflix. I'm also having a hard time finding it on DVD in stores. Hoping I can find a way to see it this year. My mom made it a tradition in our home growing up, I just want to keep that tradition going. It's a great movie, I hope it gains in popularity with the younger generations."
White Christmas (1954),Probably my least favourite Christmas film,"I fail to understand why White Christmas is still regarded as a classic. The storyline, about 2 ex-army men who team up to perform a Christmas show at a ski lodge, is hardly interesting, engaging or even festive. I've watched many classic Christmas films in my long life including Elf, Home Alone, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, Polar Express, and A Christmas Carol, to name a few. They are all way superior, entertaining and festive, whereas White Christmas is saddled with a weak plot that just never gets off the ground. Why is a show about putting on a show regarded as entertainment is beyond me! The whole plot in fact is so tedious I find it hard to maintain any interest every time I try to watch this. It is a truly boring snooze fest. I guess it probably means a lot more to those who grew up watching this from a very young age. I am also guessing it means a lot more to Americans than anyone growing up or living outside the USA. As for the title White Christmas, I think the makers should be sued under the Trade Descriptions Act. There's hardly any snow to be seen until the last few minutes. Unless 'white' actually means something else. Just saying."
White Christmas (1954),White Christmas,"Danny Kaye is much the more natural here as he (""Phil"") and successful partner ""Bob"" (Bing Crosby) hook up with the aspiring sister-act team of ""Betty"" (Rosemary Clooney) and ""Judy"" (Vera-Ellen). The latter pair have a gig at a remote Vermont inn, and so after some shenanigans on a train they all arrive to discover it is run by the gents' former wartime CO ""Gen. Waverly"" (Dean Jagger). Determined to come to the aid of this decent and proud man, they concoct a scheme to quite literally rally the troops! The gist of the plot is one of loyalty and integrity, but there is plenty of daft comedy interspersed to keep the whole thing from becoming too earnest or sentimental. The dance numbers are expertly choreographed and the musical numbers from Irving Berlin including the belters ""Sisters"" (with a little help from Gloria Wood) and ""Blue Skies"" keep the toes tapping too... It's a cheery, gentle romantic comedy that puts a smile on your face and reinforces any faith in the human spirit that might need topping up. I always found Crosby a little too slick on screen, but Kaye and Clooney are great and though perhaps just a shade too long, it's still an enjoyable seasonal romp, well worth a watch with some mulled wine and the odd chocolate Santa."
White Christmas (1954),"I get the rep, if not the appeal","Real head-scratcher, this one. It'd be easy to write off ""White Christmas"" for just the songs (none of which are my cup of tea) but one thing jumped out on this particular rewatch: is this really a Christmas movie? The only reason there's snow is that they've booked a gig in Vermont in December; Bing sings the title song a couple of times, they throw on the festive red costumes and call it a day. I mean no disrespect to this movie. Its place in the annals of history and Christmas tradition are assured, and nothing I say is gonna change that. It's an American institution at this point. And I may be left completely cold by the music, dancing and performances, but damn if the colors don't pop off the screen. That Technicolor worked wonders."
White Christmas (1954),Our favorite each year,"If they ever have a local production of White Christmas, I could step into just about any role. LOL I've been watching it annually for at least 40 years, through TV broadcasts, VHS, DVD, and now Bluray. And I've got to tell you, if you've never seen this on Bluray it's an utterly different experience ... sharp and gorgeous. Danny Kaye gets some of my favorite lines ever in a movie, especially in the early scene where they're packing to leave on the train. He's also got my favorite dance number, outside the club where the sisters were performing ... ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"". Another favorite, later in the film, is ""Count Your Blessings"". Of course, the movie begins and ends with the megahit, best-selling song of all time, White Christmas. Fantastic movie."
Dream Scenario (2023),Could've had a clearer and meaningful ending,"Could've used more substance
The movie was eerie and scary at times but it could have shown more of the dreams. The ending was messy it could have been better I am not one of those the ending has to be happy ones but still it could've ended with more of dream ads.

Dream Scenario (2023),Thought-provoking and funny film,"This film, directed by the Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli, is a comedy/horror/fantasy with an outlandish, and thought-provoking story. The life of a hapless middle-aged university professor is upended when he starts to appear in many strangers' dreams. He savours his star status thanks to these dreams while they eventually turn into nightmares which leads his life to completely different turns. This film's Charlie Kaufman-esque world is so intriguing and captivating. Borgli's unorthodox screen play has so many layers to unpack and raises many questions. Firstly, this makes us wonder if dreams can reveal our subconscious minds and what are the underlining messages of having somebody in the dreams. This film can also be seen as commenting on how instant fame impacts on people. Paul Matthews, played by Nicolas Cage, embraces this fame with enthusiasm despite his unawareness of the reasons of his fame. His responses in a TV interview clearly demonstrate his attitude to fame. Do we embrace our sudden celebrity status with a similar attitude? Additionally, this film suggests that Paul's self-righteousness and egoism lead him to enjoy this illusional ungrounded instant fame. Interestingly, this film could be a satire of our pervasive society trends of social media influencers without distinctive skills and cancel culture. Trent, played by Michael Cera, underpins the insanity and absurdity of the movement. The irony of this is that the audience fuels these trends. Nicholas Cage is commendable as Paul Matthew, an invisible university professor with the feeling of desperation to publish his book and mounting jealousy with his colleague's success. His acting is so convincing, hilarious, and at times shamelessly cringy. In particular, Cage successfully showcased his anger, shame and frustration with humour in this film. Cage's performance makes us invest into Paul Matthew's character, despite his supercilious attitude. This film is highly entertaining with many dream sequences and funny moments. My partner and I kept discussing it over dinner after the screening."
Dream Scenario (2023),A Cagey Satire That Loses Its Way,"Dream Scenario is a movie that explores the bizarre phenomenon of a biology professor who appears in everyone's dreams, and the consequences of his unwanted fame. The movie is a satire of the modern culture of celebrity, social media, and cancel culture, as well as a commentary on the human psyche and the power of dreams. The movie's strongest asset is Nicolas Cage, who delivers a brilliant performance as the professor who is both fascinated and terrified by his situation. Cage plays the role with a mix of innocence, curiosity, and desperation, as he tries to understand why he is in everyone's dreams and how to escape the nightmare. He is also very funny, especially in the scenes where he awkwardly interacts with his dreamers, or when he tries to use his fame to his advantage. The movie's weakest point is its lack of coherence and explanation. The movie never reveals why the professor is in everyone's dreams, or what causes the dreams to turn violent. The movie also jumps from one genre to another, from comedy to horror to thriller, without a clear direction or tone. The movie tries to tackle too many topics and themes, such as fame, identity, morality, science, religion, politics, and more, but it does not develop them enough or connect them well. Dream Scenario is a movie that has a lot of potential and originality, but it also has a lot of flaws and confusion. It is a movie that will make you laugh, think, and wonder, but it will also leave you unsatisfied and frustrated. It is a movie that is worth watching for Cage's performance, but it is not a movie that will stay in your dreams for long."
Dream Scenario (2023),See you in the dream,"The plot is very interesting! I have done nothing but you can see me in the dream! And I am just a passerby and did nothing! The appearance of Nicolas is so amazed and his act is still good ( oh he is a Oscar award winner), and as a normal man he was suddenly so famous because everyone see him in the dream! But everything comes to an end, where after contacting the young lady, everyone hates him as he killed them inside! He felt so upset as he did nothing wrong indeed! At last there is no happy ending as he needs to divorce and went to another, and there is no explanation why this happened. Not a good way to end the story in my view..."
Dream Scenario (2023),Nic Cage,"At his manic best. I agree with others , every other year he produces an outing of this magnitude and this could well be his biggest shot at gongs since Leaving Las Vegas. He cuts a weary figure with the world with his pursuit of literary status and perceives that his peers are undermining his progress. The make up and costume are particularly impressive, right down to the bald pate. When the plot of the title starts to unravel, the horror and comedic nuances work really well, but it's not the main crux and it's very well done to shift it in an unexpected direction . I'm particularly pleased that the vaults ( regards the strikes ) have opened up and released gems like this."
Dream Scenario (2023),"A touch of ""A dream play"" wth current references","A movie with Freddy Kruger references, how dreams and nightmares has an impact to its extreme in current real life. It is refreshing to watch a movie who uses its theme to discuss the different stages and consequences of fame without making it corny and educational (like most of Netflix-productions do...) Great acting and directing. The ending was loosing its purpose. It made me wonder why the writers didn't choose to explain the dream scenarios and instead focused on the main characters fate. But during my reflection I came to my conclusion that we don't need an explanation of the scenarios thus the movies theme. I now realized that I want to see more of how the main character coped with the situation who was established in the film and how he accepted his fate. Unfortunately, it made me pity him even more. The script could absolutely have been extended for about 15 minutes. Overall, a worth watching movie with great actors, plot, directing. Up-to-date references to our consumption of pop culture and social media with a touch of Strindbergs ""A dream play"". However the ending was a bit rushed and didnt seem well thought out."
Dream Scenario (2023),"Exquisitely Engaging, Sensationally Subtextual","A surprising blend of dark-comedy and psychological-horror defined this Nicolas Cage movie in which he played a humble family man named Paul Matthews who somehow ended up appearing in the dreams of several million people. There was no rhyme or reason behind how that was even possible, and yet Paul was where he shouldn't possibly be. One thing led to another and his newfound fame stopped being the stuff of dreams (quite literally). Instead, things gradually transformed into nightmares for everyone dreaming about him. From perceived insecurity and inherent trauma, to full-blown cancel culture followed by a witch hunt, ""Dream Scenario"" contained a wealth of sub-text worth appreciating. There was some interesting irony behind Paul teaching a class on Zebra fur-pattern evolution and how people dreaming about him doing them harm gradually grew into a ""human herd instinct"" fear. This was yet another rare and risky role for Nicolas Cage, but one that he elevated with a flawless performance. His acting in ""Dream Scenario"" further entrenched Cage's prowess as a brilliant cross-genre artist. A generous helping of Science-Fiction tropes and a good bit of dark-comedy blended with classic horror-genre elements to make ""Dream Scenario"" a recipe for filmmaking excellence. It could've gone wrong in so many ways, and yet it took all the right twists to deliver a sharp and relatable story that was equally bizarre and entertaining. I liked how they didn't just stick to the dream-scapes at the heart of this plot but also veered into Paul's psyche as a person. They captured his human side, covering his uncertainties and disappointments, including in relation to his work as an evolutionary biology professor. ""Dream Scenario"" went on to redefine creepy, but in a good way. The suspense was spot on. Moreover, the movie didn't feel like a cliché, though it very well could have. I loved everything about it, including Nicolas Cage's nuanced performance as Paul Matthews, the one guy nobody would think to dream about, yet millions of random people consistently did, and how the real-life Paul became the villain in their dreamed-up stories."
Dream Scenario (2023),A waking nightmare worth diving into,"Nicolas Cage is back, this time not battling bees or stealing Declaration of Independences but facing a much weirder threat: becoming everyone's nocturnal best friend. In Dream Scenario, Cage plays Paul Matthews, a man whose face suddenly starts popping up in millions of strangers' dreams, turning him into an overnight sensation. At first, it's all sunshine and rainbows-talk show appearances, lucrative endorsements, even a fan club of sleepwalkers. But as the line between reality and dreams blurs, Paul's dream-self morphs into a grotesque, cannibalistic monster, and his waking life becomes a waking nightmare. Director Kristoffer Borgli crafts a film that's equal parts hilarious and horrifying, a twisted satire on the fleeting nature of fame and the dark underbelly of the internet age. Think Being John Malkovich meets Inception with a dash of Twilight Zone, and you'll get a taste of the bizarre brilliance that is Dream Scenario. Cage, as always, is a force of nature, inhabiting his role with gusto and delivering deadpan lines with a wink and a raised eyebrow. He's perfectly cast as the bewildered common person thrust into the limelight; his comedic timing is impeccable even as his character descends into existential dread. The supporting cast, including Julianne Nicholson as Paul's long-suffering wife, are equally stellar, adding depth and humour to the story. The film's score is a pulsing electronic nightmare, perfectly complementing the unsettling visuals and amplifying the tension. The cinematography is equally inventive, playing with dream logic and distorted perspectives to keep us guessing. But Dream Scenario isn't just about the laughs and scares. It's a film that asks questions about the nature of identity, the power of collective consciousness, and the dangers of a society obsessed with viral fame. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, making you question your own dreams and the reality you wake up to. Now, it's not perfect. The pacing can be a bit uneven at times, and the ending, while satisfying, feels a tad rushed and less subtle in its satire than the first two-thirds. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise masterfully crafted film. Dream Scenario is a wild ride, a waking nightmare that's both hilarious and thought-provoking. It's a film that will leave you laughing, gasping, and maybe even questioning your own sanity. Try Dream Scenario if you are in search of a film that is unlike anything you have ever seen before; however, do not hold me responsible if you find yourself unable to sleep afterwards!"
Dream Scenario (2023),"Interesting ""what if"" scenario","'Dream Scenario' is a unique concept, with thousands of people seeing Paul (Cage) in their dreams, just walking through, not really participating in the dream. This then turns him into a celebrity, something Paul, his wife Janet (Nicholson), daughters Hannah (Clement) and Sophie (Bird), and boss Brett (Meadows) aren't prepared for, especially as he has no control over what's happening. The film does well to purposefully not explore the how/why it's happening and focuses on the impacts on Paul. Odd that a lot of places are billing this as a comedy - I'd say it's a drama, with a few little laughs, which then diverts into mild horror at the end, as the dreams inevitability turn into nightmares. Cage is good, and not totally manic, but plays a Professor and normal dad well, who ends up at his wits end. The ending is not as dark as it could've been, but nor is it a nice comedy ending either. There's some existential questions and a you obviously get to ask ""what would I do in this situation?"" But mostly it's probably an indictment on modern society, especially the penultimate scene. The support cast is good - should also mention Molly (Gelula) & Trent (Cera) from the PR company who play significant parts. And always good to have a Talking Heads song to wrap things up!"
Dream Scenario (2023),I'm your Nightmare,"There's something refreshing about the plainly weird premise of ""Dream Scenario"". Nicolas Cage plays a nondescript evolutionary biology professor named Paul Matthews, who suddenly appears in the dreams of his students, daughters, and people he does not know. He doesn't do anything in their recurring nighttime hallucinations of anxiety or horror, in which people sometimes float into the air or the world collapses. He more or less just strolls through the background in his sweater and glasses, sometimes flashing his dopey, pleasant smile. Paul soon becomes a phenomenon, and then a pariah when everyone's dreams co-starring Paul become violent."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),"There is so much humor, both visual and spoken. So many things made me laugh out loud.","IN A NUTSHELL:
The story is about a man who is determined to win the neighborhood's annual Christmas decorating contest. He makes a pact with an elf to help him win, but there unintended consequences of chaos. The family-friendly movie was directed by Reginald Hudlin. Writing credits go to Kelly Younger. THINGS I LIKED:
It's great to see Eddie Murphy in something again. He's great, of course. Giving way to the fun special effects, he plays a much more subdued character than we've seen him do before. When is he going to start aging? Tracee Ellis Ross is fantastic in this. I loved her fun personality. Did you know she has been nominated for 58 awards and won 12, known mostly for her role in Black-ish
The adorable Madison Thomas has an appropriate name for a character in a holiday movie: The other children in the movie are named Nick and Joy. I always get a kick out of Jillian Bell and thought she was perfect in this role. She's a quirkly, likable villain. The rest of the cast is great too, and includes Nick Offerman, Timothy Simons, Danielle Pinnock, Nancy Lenehan, Timothy Simons, and David Alan Grier as Santa! There is so much humor, both visual and spoken. So many things made me laugh out loud. I love the animated figurines in the old-timey houses. It seemed super old-fashioned Christmasy to me. The special effects are really entertaining! We've seen soooo many generic holiday movies over the years, so I loved that this story is unique and original. This movie could have easily jumped into the horror genre if it had wanted to. It made me laugh that USC was mentioned so many times in the movie. My brother is a USC law school grad! That Matrix house. Ha ha
We get a musical cameo from Pentatonix. I love that group! Keep watching during the final credits for another little scene, as well as some funny outtakes. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There is a lot going on here. Sometimes, the script is too stuffed. Even though I enjoyed the movie, it felt a little too long. TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some ""light"" profanity
Lots of destruction and mayhem. To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!"
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),"Waste of time, disappointing.","Bad movie. Waste of good actors. Terrible all around. No consistency in the plot. Don not throw away two hours of your life watching this. Eddie Murphy, if you're reading this, ""You're better than this!"" We were looking forward to this movie and it was very disappointing. We expected more from such a good cast. My husband watched it till the end, I couldn't bare to finish it. We had high hopes from the previews and thought it would turn into a Christmas classic but it is the opposite. The script, the plot, the movie was all over the place. It had potential but you didn't know where the story was going."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Mindless fun and laughter with a holiday theme,"To be frank, this movie is stupid. But for me it fell on the right side of stupid. It called back plenty of early 2000's family-oriented comedies that hold special places in my heart. Does that element of nostalgia mixed with Christmas cheer beef up my rating? Probably. But I enjoyed it, and movies are for entertainment after all. Eddie is in classic form as I remember and love him (""Daddy Daycare"" and ""Haunted Mansion"") alongside the loveable and whacky Tracee Ellis Ross who delivers her lines to perfection. Together they make quite a pair. The plot of this movie is simple enough. It ends up becoming too convoluted and drags on way, way too long. This movie could've been a comfortable 85 minutes instead of over 2 hours. But of course the takeaway is what it always is: Christmas is about family and love above all else. A message that is timeless."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Like a candy cane you hate it or love it,The movie has a good idea behind it but is sadly just not drawn out correctly. The humour in this film is a hit or miss as most of it is not very funny. It is Eddie Murphy so you either like the comedy or hate it. If it was Christmas Day this would not really be a movie I would ever put on as it is not rewatch able. If you had young kids you could put this on as it is a PG which can offer something for kids to watch at Christmas at least. Overall this movie is like a candy cane you hate it or you love it but sadly in my opinion it just does not hit the spot and that is why candy cane lane is a. 4/10 = worse than mediocre.
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Fun movie,"I like the idea of this movie. Kind of a Christmas Jumanji.. instead of a game being played, a Christmas decoration contract has been signed. And that contract is causing problems. It's always good to see Eddie Murphy. Yes, he's toned down a bit because it's a family movie, but that's cool. The movie ends with almost everyone having learned a good lesson. Peppermint (the fallen elf) is obnoxious, but that's how she's supposed to be. The whole movie could have been better, certainly, but it was a fun Christmas movie anyway. The cast is a good one. I watched after Christmas. I think that next year, I'll watch it again.. before Christmas."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Eddie Murphy can do better.,"The trailer looked brilliant, but please don't be fooled by that. I've seen and even liked films worse than this, but can I have my almost 2 hours back please?? I kept watching in the vain hope that the film would actually pick up at some point, but boy was I mistaken. This film is a complete mish-mash of every corny Christmas film I've ever seen. I don't understand how or why Eddie Murphy took this role. He can do tons better than this film. To call it corny is an understatement. Were Amazon scraping the barrel with this film or what?? I seriously hope that Amazon didn't pay a lot for the film, otherwise they'll be asking for their money back...
Not worth the time to watch it."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Its Idiot Movie :),"Even though its idiot movie but entertainer for Christmas. Who dont want to be bit idiot and believe in Christmast Miracles. Its fantasy life, you got to be believe in magic, life is magic and thats how it achieved in the movie. I Loved the movie as is, there has to be movies like this, light hearted, fun, for kids, for Christmas and for our beloved Santa Claus. If you love Christmas then you will really love this movie without any conditions. Eddie Murphy is true brand ambassador of such fun movies. I recommend all the children's to watch movie and keep the spirit of Santa Claus growing. Love Santa, Love Christmas :)"
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),A Heartwarming Surprise,"I'm glad I ignored the reviews and gave this movie a shot over Christmas. It turned out to be the ideal family-friendly film that was enjoyable for everyone. It hits that sweet spot of not being too childish and also isn't violent. It also has straightforward and easily understandable storytelling and dialogue, which was great for my non-native English-speaking parents who are difficult to please when it comes to movies. They really enjoyed it. The pacing is spot-on, and the storyline is well-structured with a good dose of humor. It isn't laugh out loud funny, but I had a few chuckles - that's fine for me as I don't need to roll on the floor laughing to enjoy myself. The characters are all great. Some scenes are a little cringy, due to the clichéd direction they take, but that's fine for these types of movies. My only criticism is there was one scene with the Elf making reference to Christmas not being about Jesus, she was a bad elf, but IMO it's best not to include offensive things like that. Overall it's a wholesome, feel-good movie."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Bah Humbug!!!,"We are die hard Christmas fans and we really wanted to love this movie. We previously watched the movie ""Genie"" and my daughter loved it, but this here is one discombobulated mess! Horrible overacting, unfunny and wayyyyy too long for its own good! It could have been great, but the focus on product placement was just too apparent and the movie itself suffered from the zero chemistry from the underdeveloped and unlikable actors. The only thing this movie had going for it is Eddie and unfortunately, even that wasn't enough to save this bomb of a movie. Ultimately, this will be a forgotten movie rather than a repeatable classic. A one time watch is all this flick is worth and even then, fails at holding your attention. I fell asleep after the first hour and I never do that for great Christmas movies which this was not! All the reviews on Youtube must be bots as it seems its getting 100% likability which is why I watched it when in fact it was closer to what we see here on IMDB."
Candy Cane Lane (I) (2023),Clunky and forgettable!,"A Christmas classic it is not! Horrible acting, unfunny and unoriginal! Went in with high hopes and fell asleep an hour in! Not sure why they needed to make this mess of a movie 2 hours long as it felt like torture sitting through it! Definitely a one time watch (if you make it all the way through) but not to be repeated! My children loooooove everything Christmas, and they walked away unsatisfied with this one! Just another example of horrible writing, terrible directing, uninspiring plot, stale jokes, over-acting ""in a bad way"" and obvious product placement which was probably the point of this movie and nothing to do with the spirit of the holiday! Obvious attempt at a money grab!"
May December (2023),What the hell did I watch,"Boy oh boy I don't know why this was filmed. Whilst Natalie porter and julienne Moore are great actresses this was not the film for them. First of all its not a comedy or a dark comedy, I actually found it stressful watching this, kept waiting for the story to begin of when what or where they met but nothing. Just people saying they met at school when he was 17. All the family sitting at table eating too much doom and gloom. I mean was she wasn't she abused????? It just revolved around julienne moor crying like a baby, ending was rubbish, dont know why this was made. There could have been a lot more to this story which would have been enjoyable to watch but nothing. Just glad I didn't waste my money watching this at the cinema."
May December (2023),Never really goes anywhere,"The performances, from Portman especially, are good, but the movie never really goes anywhere. The idea is intriguing, but it felt like the movie was building to some big emotional climax that never happened. The storyline with the son from the first marriage never went anywhere. The affair with the current husband was kind of pointless and had no real effect on the plot. Nothing really happens with any of the kids. We don't see the finished movie Portman is making have any kind of effect on the characters or her in universe career. My biggest complaint is that the film makers give us this heinous crime and then refuse to have anything to say about it. They don't take a stand to say what Moore's character did was disgusting and they don't really manage to humanize her, if they were even trying to. They just brush over the fact that this woman seduced and sexually assaulted a 13 year old. Something that big, and that central to the story should have been addressed in some way, not hand waved away. None of the characters are very likable either. In the end, it feels like a waste of time because there never was a payoff for anything."
May December (2023),Very complex and thought provoking,"May December is an intensely complex dark comedy masterfully directed by Todd Haynes (Far From Heaven and Carol are among my favorite films). Julienne Moore plays Gracie, a woman in her late 50's caught up in having sex with a seventh grader boy in her 30's. She went to jail and had his baby and later they married and still together 23 years later. Charles Melton plays the husband in his 30's. Natalie Portman plays Elizabeth, an actress who is about to play Gracie in a movie. She comes to town to observe and understand them. The well written screenplay is outstanding as well as the three principal actors. Moore and Portman are both Oscar winning actresses and Melton keeps up with them. All three should receive Oscar nominations as well as the script. The film is a well crafted puzzle many scenes are open to interpretation. Cocoon/butterfly and fox/predator scenes and references are well placed. This is a very adult film 🎥 which stays with you after you finish it and makes you think a lot about the characters and their motivations. Very highly recommended 👍👍👍👍
Available on Netflix in USA and Canada, but playing in movie theaters in Turkey and Europe."
May December (2023),Great character study,"For starters, don't expect there to be lots of action or any wild happenings. This movie is more of a realistic character study, so one must pay attention to all the subtle details to really get the most of it. The movie makes a bold stylistic choice with an omnipresent repeated theme, which gives it more of a classical feeling. It is unlike most contemporary films that tend to be a lot more fast paced. Instead, May December is more reminiscent of older movies, with slower rhythm and more depth to them. Here, nothing is spoon fed to the audience, however the strong writing + acting gives us enough information to understand the different dynamics at play - and they're all interesting. As the movie goes on, the veil progressively lifts to reveal the emotional depths (or lack thereof) of the characters. However, it does so without ever giving easy answers. The realization is amazing, and the music gives the movie an ethereal feeling that reveals the layer beneath the surface. May December always plays on two fronts, with the action taking place before our eyes, and the underlying emotional motivation of the characters. In the end, what we end is a masterful character study, understated in its action because most of what it has to say is hidden in the depths of the human psyche."
May December (2023),Provocative without sensentializing,"This is a movie review of ""May/December,"" directed by Todd Hayes. Hayes does an excellent job of creating a thoughtful and provocative film based on a sensational event. Although Hayes loves melodrama, he takes a non-fiction story and parallels it with a fictional story of making a film about it. The characters played by Portman and Moore are both observed objects who create a self-narrative where they are the heroes. However, in the end, they both turn out to be delusional. The scene where Moore's character makes up Portman expresses the connection. Hayes direction combines naturalist and expressionistic overtones adding the right element of distance from its outherwise sensation subject."
May December (2023),Thin suburban drama lacking substance,"Todd Haynes has been brilliant in the past, but here he seriously falters. The film lacks the spark of enthusiasm that might have made up for the fact that there simply isn't an interesting story here to begin with. Deals with mental illness but only goes as deep as the glancing edge, and prefers instead to be mainly an uninsightful commentary about borderline narcissism, selfish, poor behavior, and some dull bits about acting and being an actor. Many scenes lacking in meaning and displaying only average dialogue and performances should have been cut out. Avenues that should have been pursued or at least satisfactorily explained were not, such as how and why would an actress spend days and weeks with someone they are meant to portray, who is patently uninteresting, and whose mannerisms and motivations can be imitated and deciphered very quickly? Who cares why these bland and monotonous individuals made odd life choices? It is the film's job to make things compelling or shed light on something, and nothing is really even interesting here. Each main character has flaws, but what this reveals about the human condition is zero. We simply witness tedious people having tiresome conversations which reveal far too little. We can guess, but always lurking at every moment is the dreaded ""Who Cares?"" No matter how hard you apply yourself to the themes covered, you will come up light, unless you enjoy medium temperature suburban drama that goes on for two solid hours with scant material to explore. Yes, we see there are some ""meta"" themes to pay attention to, but they are not substantial enough to make up for the lack of convincing emotion or energy."
May December (2023),Had Potential,"This movie really has an interesting and thoughtful storyline with little details that made it seem like it was based on a true story. That was nicely done. Somewhat shockingly, the music was out of an '80s or early '90s movie. It gave the effect of being more like a Lifetime movie. That doesn't particularly bother me but I just thought it was extremely interesting. You don't see that in movies today. And for good reason I think. People have moved past that musical style. This was approaching a seven for me but didn't quite get there. The positive elements again were the interesting storyline and the tension among some of the characters and the development of the plot and the characterization. The drawback was again the music was a little off and the story just wasn't quite as compelling as a seven rated movie would be. It was funny in the graduation scene how they were clearly attempting to announce the graduates in alphabetical order but failed. Sloppy writing there. Also after they announced about eight students whose last name started with ""A"" the principal quickly said congratulations to the class of 2015 without any kind of a segue. ABOUT MY REVIEWS: I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it. My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable."
May December (2023),This is why we generally don't listen to movie critics...,"When you watch this film, you understand it is great acting, masterful film making, and something quite out of the ordinary, which are all reasons why critics love it. Simultaneously, I imagine most viewers absolutely hate it, as did I. Meandering, depressing and totally boring. I watch movies to be captivated and entertained. Confusing, meandering, irksome characters with all kinds of major emotional issues. I understand subtleties and stories that are told in such a way as to intentionally challenge viewers and keep them guessing (LA Confidential comes to mind), but this movie took this to an unnecessary extreme. It's as if the director was thinking to himself smugly how smart he is while completely outsmarting himself and losing all audience attention and interest in the process. I do love Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore, they're both phenomenal talents and have had stellar careers, which is why I watched all the way through but I now realize I would have rather spent those two hours scraping my fingernails on a chalkboard or watching paint dry 😡."
May December (2023),Complete Garbage,This film was very bad. The fact that it's loosely based off a true story makes it even worse. All they had to do was film it as it happened in real life and it would have been much more interesting. I'm not sure how they even managed to get real actors to sign on to this disaster of a film. I would rather watch Gili than this film again. Even the cinematography was boring. The colouring was so muted I felt like I was watching a documentary from the 70s. I suggest you go find a field and stand in it for 2 hours and you will have better spent your time than suffering through this horrible mess of a film.
May December (2023),Worth watching,"The movie perfectly shows how complex it is to know a person and figure out why they did what they did. Great acting and all. But one important thing that made me give it a 7 was that, when you finish the movie you still have so many unsolved questions that you had in the first place. The movie didn't answer whatsoever. It also focused on aspects of characters that we already has figured out. It was also kind of sad and uncomfortable at some points, but overall a very good movie to watch. Also it's good to say that, the contrast of behavior's of characters and how different they were at the beginning was perfectly shown. At the end of the movie you could clearly see how Natalie Portman was becoming Gracy(?)"
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),Skip this miscast and disappointing Hollywood stereotypical tripe,"We slogged through Killers of the Flower Moon last night -- over long pedantic movie (close to 4 hours) -- completely miscast with Robert DeNiro and Leonardo Dicaprio in the two lead characters. It was a huge disappointment. Would have been much better and believable with someone like Kevin Costner in the William Hale role -- DeNiro is simply unbelievable as an Okie/Texas rancher. It's like a mafia gangster trying to play a Texas cowboy... very poor choice in casting. Ernest Burkhart should have been played by much younger man as he had only returned from fighting in WW1 at the beginning of the movie. I would have picked Jefferson White (Jimmy from Yellowstone) as he is the right age, able to portray the moral ambivalence, and would have done a terrific job. Scorsese definitely has an ego and could benefit from a good editor -- the movie did not need to be almost 4 hours long. Oh how I wish Taylor Sheridan had produced and/or directed this movie. The true hero of this very tragic true story is Tom White and his role was not brought to the forefront. Without Tom White the killers would never have been brought to justice. J Edgar Hoover was missing from the movie and Tom White would not have been sent to Oklahoma but for him. There was quite a bit of back and forth between White and Hoover -- again missing from the movie. Only right spot in the entire casting was Lily Gladstone -- she should receive an award for simply having to act with DeNiro and Dicaprio. She did a terrific job but was underutilized. This was an ego project for a bunch of folks who have no business attempting to portray anything in 1920-30's Oklahoma. Once again -- Hollywood and/or New York have zero clue about what makes Oklahoma the complex state that it is. Scorsese plies tired old stereotypes without truly digging deeper into what caused an entire group of the noble Osage people to be treated so poorly."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),A timeless piece that gets better with each watch,"Based on David Grann's book, killers Of The Flower Moon captures a tragic history of systematic murder of the Osage people for their oil wealth. Scorsese vividly captures the themes of greed, exploitation and power play in this chilling non fiction story. He also unapologetically displays the culture of the Osage people in their dress, music, funeral and superstitious beliefs. One does not only appreciate the level of callousness and deceitfulness demonstrated by these greedy ""wolves"" but one is also sucked into the culture and life of the Osage people in a way you could imagine it when reading the book. As far as the 3 leading characters are concerned, Leonardo DiCaprio's character as Ernest Burkhart was played to perfection. He was servant in the US army infantry division and came to live with and work for his uncle. However, his inability to reflect deeply on the consequences of orders given to him by his uncle made him a tool that was used in perpetrating the heinous crimes committed by his uncle in order to have the headrights to his wife's family oil wealth. He was also a morally conflicted man who in a way tried to convince and deceive himself that he was doing the right thing by obeying his uncle's orders. Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart was the soul of this story. She symbolizes the irreversible physical and emotional damage the genocide had on families. Her subtle, soulful, haunting and emotionally alluring portrayal of Mollie Burkhart was an outstanding achievement and one for the ages. This is a movie that gets better with each watch and its only when considerable time has passed before cinephiles and film critics will realize how truly outstanding this movie is."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),The banality of evil,"A stunning exploration of the banality of evil centers on Ernest Burkhart, played brilliantly and powerfully by DiCaprio. Sometimes I blinked and saw not an actor, but a real criminal from black and white photographs of the century before last - limited, evil, greedy, with the face of degradation. And most importantly, he is a master at lying to himself. This is amazing - how can you feel good while killing your wife's relatives, the mother of your children? How can you believe that you are a loving husband (he believes, that's what's amazing!) when you inject your wife with a drug that clearly makes her worse. I had a strange association that Ernest, as if under a magnifying glass, showed the same effect of a split psyche as the population of totalitarian aggressor countries, whose population also convinced and continues to convince themselves of their innocence. That evil manifested with their consent is the will of God (or the leader, or the will of the uncle) - and I am actually not a monster (approving genocide, committing bloodshed), not a murderer, I am good. I take care of my wife. I injected her with poison and then carefully combed her hair...
DiCaprio and Scorsese brilliantly embodied this character. It's a banality of evil that's impossible to believe and that sucks Molly in like sticky swamp mud. But I admit, I couldn't watch the movie without interruption. I needed a drink, a snack and just to get up. Although the direction and cinematography are beautiful and I didn't get bored, it was physically difficult for me to spend so much time sitting in front of the screen. As a book publishing editor, I know that authors are against abbreviations - they worked a lot on the text. But often the book (film) only benefits from this."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),Horrible with no redeeming value,The story is important worth telling but is essentially done in the first 1/2 hour of the movie. The rest is excruciating to get through. You have some of the worst acting of Leonardo's career where he spends half or more of the movie with some of weird Slingblade like mugging frown even his voice is Slingblade-ish. And that is the extent of his acting. De Niro was okay but not stretching any acting muscles here. The best was Lily Gladstone but her character is so benign that she doesn't occupy much space. The film ended up being too long with no story twists or surprises nor most importantly redemption to any the very unpleasant characters.
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),Leonardo DiCaprio truly transformed into the character Ernest Burkhart in this movie.,"IN A NUTSHELL:
They had me at Martin Scorsese. His directing is fantastic but that's not news. He also worked as a screenwriter and producer on the film. He said that he knew he wanted to make the story into a movie as he was reading the book ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" by David Grann. He spent hours with Chief Standing Bear of the Osage Nation to grant permission to film it. About the movie, Scorsese said, ""It's not a whodunnit. It's a who-didn't-do-it.""
The screenplay was written by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese. I'm sure we'll see this nominated for Best Picture. THINGS I LIKED:
The stellar cast includes Academy Award winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Brendan Fraser. Multi-award winners John Lithgow and Jesse Plemons round out the star-studded cast. Other noteworthy cast members are Lily Gladstone, Tantoo Cardinal, William Belleau, and Louis Cancelmi. I've been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio since his earliest films and always thought he was a talented chameleon. He truly transformed into the character Ernest Burkhart in this movie. DiCaprio was paid $30 million for this movie, the most money of his career for one film. Robert De Niro looks fantastic. He's 80 years old but played a character who was 45-years old when these murders happened. Director Martin Scorsese quickly selected Lily Gladstone for her role because of the ""truthfulness in her eyes"" when they met over Zoom. Stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. We get to learn about Indian culture, language, and even an explanation of what the Flower Moon is. This was the last movie of actor Larry Sellers who was actually of Osage and Cherokee Indian descent. While there are Hollywood liberties taken with the film, it's based on a true story. I love how Scorsese incorporated the look and feel of black and white photos into the development of the story. Fun fact: We learn in the movie that it was the investigation of the murders in Osage County that was the first case given to the newly-formed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). President J. Edgar Hoover led the case. The movie cost $200 million to make. It's officially the most expensive biographical movie ever made. The movie was filmed in Oklahoma. The ending was powerful. I loved the idea and thought it was very clever to reveal the rest of the story through a radio show reenactment. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
This movie is VERY long! While Scorsese is lauded as royalty in Hollywood, a really long movie is often a sign of indulgence by a director who doesn't have the grit to make needed edits. The story could have been told in much less time. Surprisingly, this movie is only 3 minutes longer than Scorsese's film The Irishman. I wanted to see the moment Leonardo DiCaprio's character fell in love with Lily Gladstone's character. I wanted that first, magical kiss. Instead, it goes from mild flirting in one scene to making out in the next. Rather than tell the story in a simple chronological order, it would have been more interesting to reveal various parts as the FBI uncovered them in their investigation. TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not an appropriate movie for kids. They'll probably be bored anyway. Profanity, including F-bombs
We see several people shot, resulting in blood splats. We see a man get poisoned to death. We see other bloodied, dead bodies. Violence with guns, knives, and fist fights. Murder, fires, destruction. To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!"
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),A Tedious Bore of 3.5 hours,"Killers Of The Flower Moon Overall it was good not great and certainly not as good as the hype surrounding this movie. What was great, styling and cinematography, great direction and brilliant music. What was good, we had good script delivered by committed actors exploring a worthy subject, that's it! What was seriously problematic, a near glacial pace for no particular reason than perhaps to infer we were watching something profound. A great deal of repetition, similar murders, sitting in cars, conversations, facial expressions, medical procedures, actors being tired. To my mind a decent edit would have greatly improved this movie. Overall I was bored and the whole movie was tedious, Robert de Niro played himself, Leonardo DiCaprio seem to be ripping off Marlon Brando, and seem to employ two faces throughout. Lily Gladstone, who played Molly did a fabulous job, but we had little range from her apart from exhausted and placid and the odd emotional outburst. With regard to the Oscars I Think at best, it would go to the adapted screenplay or indeed the music or cinematography, but there is just not a single stand out acting part that deserves a gong. Overall, I'm giving this a 6 out of 10. I'm glad I watched it, but I never want to think about this movie ever again. Hollywood should stick to entertainment and not trot out worthy garbage in an attempt to educate us!"
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),An unforgettable masterpiece,"The movie was very touching for me. I had no idea about Osage nation before and now through this movie I totally understand why I had no. I felt very sad for Osage people. Even though the movie explains many details for 3 hours which were not enough for such a story, after the movie I kept searching and reading about Osages. I hope people's greed will end one day. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone played their role very succesful. They managed to give all the feelings to audience. I think there are more heartbreaking stories about Indians and the genocide. I wish more movies will be filmed later."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),This will age like wine,"Boring at times, yes
too long, yes at the same time Incredibly emotionally gripping cinematic masterpiece that
brings to light a mostly forgotten piece of history. Also it was a complete twist on the ""western"" format, might even be Scorseses attempt at a historical conclusion to the format entirely. This film will change things and will as so many others only become more cherished in the future. The cinematography provides some scenes which pull forth an ancient tribal feeling, a connection with the surroundings that seems completely lost in other movies that make an attempt at it. In most films love seems to be about romance and the solution to problems. Here it is portrayed as ideal yet cursed. It leaves the viewer feeling hollow and bewildered. Deniro as the bad guy did not invoke any sympathy: also rare in current cinema. He was simply a monster from the first second to the last. Personally it was refreshing to see a bad guy without any backstory, remorse or exceptional ""coolness"". This is a masterpiece. A very speciel one."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),Well made and great performances but ultimately sad and depressing,"Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro. The cream of the crop. They are joined by some great supporting actors and actresses. I loved the sets, the gritty reality of the period and attention to details. Everyone acted their socks off making the story and the horror of it seem so real and therein lies my problem. I identified so strongly with Molly and the plight of her people that the sheer evil of the actions, the brutal callousness of most of the white people in this movie sickened me. I felt numb after finishing this movie. Not because of the 3 and a half hour run time, but by the callous way the native Americans were eliminated for greed. I went to bed shocked. When I woke the next day I spoke to my wife about the movie. The first thing I said was that was the most depressing film I have ever seen. She agreed with me. I wish I had not seen it. I did not need that evil sadistic drama in my life. That feeling I have is due to the outstanding performances and crafting of the story by Scorsese and everyone else involved. A masterpiece, but a troubling depressing one. That's why I can only give it 5 / 10. I wish I had not seen it."
Killers of the Flower Moon (2023),Another Overrated Scorsese Film,"For starters, this movie is way too slow, long, and mostly uninteristing. It's a shame considering the tragic story it seeks to tell. Leonardo DiCaprio is starting to lose his luster and was severely misplaced as a WWI veteran who's pushing 50 but was continually portrayed as an young man. De Niro has never been a good actor and this film highlights how mediocre he's always been. Go back and watch any Scorsese/De Niro film, and you'll realize how overrated they both are. Yes, I'm talking about films like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Cape Fear, and even Goodfellas. Most people believe these are good movies because the critics tell you they are, but if you can watch them with an open mind you'll realize how terrible they all are. This movie follows the same pattern of bad storytelling and bad acting. To make matters worse, it portrays the Osage people in a very bad light."
Sound of Freedom (2023),A messy approach,"Hi everyone, Its Mr C Reviewer, The Movie we are here to talk about tonight is: The sound of freedom. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD but found out its now available to buy as well as rent on Prime video, It was directed and written by Alejandro Monteverde, with assistance from Rod Barr, which has a runtime of 2 hours and 11 minutes. The movie is rated 15 and was first released in the USA in June 22nd, 2023. Summary: A federal agent embarks on a perilous journey to save a young girl from the clutches of child-traffickers. After successfully rescuing her brother from a ruthless criminal organization, the agent learns of the girl's dire situation and makes the difficult decision to risk his life to save her. Leaving his job behind, the agent ventures deep into the treacherous Colombian jungle, facing countless challenges and life-threatening situations. With time running out, he is forced to confront the harsh realities of human trafficking and the devastating impact it has on innocent lives. Review: -I was particularly impressed by the way certain scenes were shot. The film featured some stunning views that added to its visual appeal. The cinematography captured these beautiful shots effectively, allowing the audience to fully appreciate them. Additionally, while there were a few scenes with dim lighting, the filmmakers ensured that viewers could still see everything that was necessary to understand and enjoy the movie. One standout moment in terms of cinematography was a camera shot outside a building. The camera followed the movement of a person through a window, zooming in, and seamlessly transitioning into the room. This technique was employed both at the start and end of the movie, creating a sense of continuity and artistic flair. The soundtrack of the film complemented the scenes exceptionally well. The choice of music enhanced the overall experience and added depth to various moments throughout the movie. Personally, I enjoyed the soundtrack and felt that it suited many of the scenes perfectly. However, I believe it could have been even more impactful if there had been a few additional tracks mixed in, rather than solely relying on the existing music that the movie had. I was pleased to find that the parts that were not in English had subtitles, which allowed me to understand what was being said. As a person who prefers watching movies with subtitles, I appreciated this feature. Additionally, as someone with auditory processing disorder, subtitles greatly assist me in comprehending the dialogue. However, I feel that it would have been even more enjoyable if the movie had subtitles throughout its entirety. There were moments within the film where I struggled to hear and understand what was being said. Upon conducting research on the movie, I discovered that some others also faced similar challenges. Though personally, I do feel like I would have also preferred if the movie had been dubbed in English. This would have eliminated the need for me to pause the film repeatedly to read the subtitles fully. -I feel that the casting choices for the film were generally acceptable, with some actors delivering convincing performances. Their portrayals added depth and credibility to the movie's overall atmosphere. The acting felt believable in some scenes, but there were moments when it seemed less convincing. The pacing of the movie was relatively quick, as it started without any unnecessary delays. This helped to maintain the audience's interest and kept them engaged throughout the film. -The photoshoot scene in the movie could have been improved with a few alterations to enhance its effectiveness and maintain the sensitivity of the subject matter. A camera shot focusing on the door with the woman voice directing the kids and the flash under the door would have been more effective. This shot would create anticipation and draw attention to what is happening behind closed doors, symbolizing the hidden nature of human trafficking. To make the scene a little longer it could have included a viewpoint of the camera flashing with just the woman telling them what to do behind it, as well as one close-up shot of her applying lipstick on one of the kids and that it for that scene. In the original scene, I feel like it showed too much detail that was not essential for the story. The scene appeared to go over the top, detracting from the overall experience of the movie. Despite its commendable aim of raising awareness about human trafficking, the portrayal of children posing for photos seemed to be handled insensitively, potentially undermining the film's overall message and while it is important to provide context and background information, it is equally crucial not to overwhelm viewers with unnecessary information. By streamlining certain aspects of the scene, such as extraneous dialogue or excessive props, the focus can remain on conveying a powerful message about human trafficking, and the portraying children posing for photos in a less explicit manner would prevent any potential prurient interest from arising. The filmmakers had a crucial opportunity to shed light on the horrifying reality of child trafficking, but instead, they opted for a convoluted and messy approach that does more harm than good. This is a missed opportunity to educate and inform viewers about this pressing issue. The film's portrayal of human trafficking also could have been more effective by focusing on the emotional and psychological impact on the victims, rather than dwelling on the visual aspects of the crime. By doing so, the filmmakers would have been able to provide a more comprehensive and empathetic understanding of the issue, resonating with the audience on a deeper level. -The lack of focus on survivors, shallow character development, and missed opportunities to delve deeper into the consequences of human trafficking all contribute to its shortcomings as a movie. The reviewer suggests that this story would have been better suited for a television series format. By presenting it in parts, a TV show could allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the topic, giving it the time and attention needed to tell it properly. This would provide ample opportunity to delve into the various aspects of human trafficking, including its effects on survivors, their families, and those working to combat this heinous crime. I think it is essential to portray the reality of child trafficking, as it is not solely perpetuated by sinister strangers who abduct children under the cover of darkness. The reality, not sufficiently explored in the film, is that many perpetrators are individuals known to the families, often exploiting drug-addicted parents' vulnerability or preying on teenagers facing rejection often due to their sexual orientation. Its exploration of gender dynamics within this complex issue was thought-provoking and raises awareness about the involvement of both men and women in perpetrating these crimes. While it could have delved deeper into this aspect, I do think that the film successfully challenged some societal stereotypes and sheds light on the often overlooked experiences of male survivors as well. -To be frank, I found most of the children's reactions in the movie after being saved to be unrealistic. They were shown dancing, laughing, and playing. It seemed like the movie portrayed these reactions to make it feel more uplifting. In reality, children who have been rescued from human trafficking would likely experience a mix of emotions including happiness but also trauma, withdrawal, and potential addiction to drugs that they were hooked onto by the traffickers. They may not immediately want to go home and face their families due to what they have been through, needing time to heal and recover if they choose to do so. The ending of the movie gave the impression that the children are saved, happy, and everything is fine, when in reality this is just the beginning of their journey towards healing and recovery. It is important to note that someone watching the movie for the wrong reasons might also mistakenly assume that everything is perfectly fine now for these children. -I think that while the quote ""God's children are not for sale"" carries an important message about human trafficking and exploitation, it may not be the most inclusive or effective way to communicate this message. -While watching the movie, I found myself shedding a few tears, but I had expected to be moved to tears far more frequently. The film, in my opinion, failed to deliver the powerful and emotional impact that I had anticipated. This was not only due to the emotional resonance, but also the narrative structure and storytelling technique employed in the movie. The film's narrative suffered from a disjointed and poorly structured presentation. It frequently jumped between different time periods and locations, leaving viewers feeling disoriented and struggling to piece together the events. It seemed as though some scenes that could have connected the different storylines were omitted, which only added to the confusion."
Sound of Freedom (2023),"When God tells you what to do, you cannot hesitate.","After being visited in their home by a local beauty queen/talent scout, a Honduran father named Roberto takes his son & daughter (Miguel and Rocio) to a local talent showcase for the day. Upon arriving, the talent scout tells Roberto that parents aren't allowed to stay, but that the children will be well looked after, and that he should return at 5PM to pick them up. Thinking nothing of it, Roberto arrives back at 5PM, only to find that no one, especially his children, are to be found. Tim Ballard works for homeland security and tracks down pedophiles. After winning the trust of one such pedo, Tim is able him in order to rescue one little boy from the grips of his abductor (or, rather the man who bought him from those who abducted him). That little boy happens to be Miguel (Roberto's son). From there, Tim Ballard sets out to bring Miguel's sister (Rocio) home as well. This movie should win every award possible! Am I saying it's the best movie ever made? No, but it is certainly one of the most important movies ever made!! The director, producers, cast & production team should all feel very proud, and the real Tim Ballard (along with those who aided him) should all receive medals, and then some. Idk how the cast could've been better. It's possible, I guess, but maybe not. They were all amazing (and yes, I noticed Ali Landry as the nurse 😍). I believed it all. There was no fake/phony acting going on. They made it feel real. I now see why so many people were championing this film in the last year. It's a must see. (whether you can stomach it or not is another question,, but everyone should try to watch it)"
Sound of Freedom (2023),"Despite the subject, it is just an OK film with a distracting soundtrack.","**SPOILER** I am aware of films like this and that child trafficking is prevalent throughout the world. This film takes place in poorer countries and does not deal with any cases from the US (which doesn't take away from the subject matter), but it is one of the reasons the main character Tim was told to come back to America and abort the mission. The US was paying for kids to be found in other countries at that point. I really tried to like this movie, but the music they used to evoke emotions instead of just using good actors, was so loud that it detracted from the story. I had a headache by the time the movie was done. It wasn't as profound as people rating this movie led on."
Sound of Freedom (2023),WHAT'S WITH ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS?,"Am I missing something? All these glowing reviews, but it's not all that by long stretch. Slow moving. Dialogue is always whispered making it hard to catch what is being said. Had to watch with subtitles to catch what was being said. Very over hyped. Important subject matter but overall very disappointing. Glad I didn't pay money to see it. On the positive, photography and soundtrack is good. Seen enough in the media already about human trafficking not to be shocked by the subject matter of this film. Sad situation but this film doesn't do all that much to shed a light on the dark recesses of our sick society. I still don't get all the rave reviews. The movie ""Traffic"" was so much better. Writing this as I'm watching the movie because I'm so bored."
Sound of Freedom (2023),This beautiful film had me weeping,"This beautiful film had me weeping. I do not usually cry during movies, the last time was when I watched ""I am not Ashamed"" about Rachel Joy Scott and ""End of the Spear"" about Nate Saint and the other men killed with him. ""Sound of freedom had me crying within the first five minutes of the start of the movie. And I couldn't hold back my tears for the whole movie. It is such a good movie and one that touches on a subject of a horrible and inhuman thing that is done to millions of people daily. I am so grateful to Angel Studios to be bold enough to stand for what is right and tell the world this story. If you have not watched this movie I, suggest you go do so right now."
Sound of Freedom (2023),How can you not like this movie and message,"""Sound of Freedom"" is an extraordinary cinematic experience that seamlessly weaves together gripping storytelling and powerful performances. The film's compelling narrative, based on true events, takes the audience on an emotional journey, shedding light on the harsh realities of human trafficking. Jim Caviezel's stellar portrayal of Tim Ballard, a real-life hero, adds depth and authenticity to the film. The cinematography is stunning, capturing both the intensity of rescue missions and the poignant moments of hope and resilience. ""Sound of Freedom"" is not just a movie; it's a call to action, raising awareness about a critical issue while delivering a captivating and thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece."
Sound of Freedom (2023),Taken 4: Columbia,"One of the most annoying things about this film was the lack of consequences for the victims. Everything just goes back to normal for the suffering kids as soon as they're home, which couldn't be further from reality. There was potential for a poignant moment at the end if Rocio had admired the drum gifted by her father, but didn't play it. The juxtaposition of her love for music at the beginning of the film drumming with plastic bottles bookended with a subtle/nonchalant reaction toward the drum at the end after however many months of torture and losing something that she can never get back could have been powerful. But she just goes on thumping away like nothing happened cause she liked drums before and she likes drums still. Get it? Get it?! Best part of the movie was when the main character's wife says ""she feels like my kid too"" about this trafficked child the two characters have never discussed or had any sort of conversation about. Uhhh...ok? That part did make me cackle so 10/10 for that inspired line!"
Sound of Freedom (2023),A Must Watch,"I have always found it EXTREMELY difficult to watch commercials, let alone movies, on any type of cruelty or torture ~ especially to people in general, children, elderly or animals. I didn't know if I could watch this but with all of the great reviews, I had to try. I'm happy I did. It was done perfectly! Of course the topic was heart-wrenching and sadly, eye-opening; however, the acting was superb and with the knowledge that this was based on a true story, it was intriguing. A must watch. I'm happy to learn that laws have been changed to help combat this epidemic. I also hope that the those involved with this movie receive the much-deserved awards for bringing this topic to the big screen. We must ALL be vigilant in watching for young children who appear to be in distress. It's sad to live in a world that demands these actions of us, but it's true."
Sound of Freedom (2023),The First 48 Meets Schindler's List Meets Taken,"This movie is well shot, well directed, relatively well written, the music/score is questionable, the acting isn't bad. In short, it's effective as a film. But good lord is the subject matter depressing when it's not outright horrifying. Since it's well shot and well directed it's great at really pulling you into the world of underground child trafficking and the terrifying realities of everyday life in impoverished regions run by gangs. It's so depressing I was tempted to write this review as a comedy, like ""For a laugh out loud zany time the whole family can enjoy, watch 'The Sound of Freedom'!"" They did a good job with the sets/on-location. It needs to be about 30 minutes shorter. You're going to have to wash this movie off when it's over."
Sound of Freedom (2023),"Tough, impactful, snappy & engaging true-tale child-trafficking drama","In true-tale child-trafficking drama ""Sound Of Freedom"" child-porn busting cop Jim Caviezel (supported by wife Mira Sorvino) is disillusioned with catching peddlers but not saving the actual child victims - so he starts to, sparking a crusade taking him to Colombia to rescue more (aided by the likes of Bill Camp)... and when the authority of his job expires he quits it and forges on with his mission regardless. It's a tough & impactful watch, but props to co-writer (with Rod Barr) / director Alejandro Monteverde who with his 3rd film (and the first since 2015's ""Little Boy"") maintains a snappy, pacy & engaging style. It's hard-hitting & noble, but is also most watchable."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),A courtroom drama that goes deeper as it went farther.,"""Anatomy of a Fall"" is a brilliantly put-together film that smartly intertwines the meticulousness of a legal drama with the emotional complexities of family life. This isn't your typical courtroom thriller; it's a thoughtful and intimate look at the unraveling of a marriage under the spotlight of a legal battle. The tension in the film is palpable, particularly during the courtroom scenes where the dialogue is razor-sharp, cutting into the heart of the marital discord between the protagonists. Throughout the film, viewers are presented with a complex puzzle. Rather than feeding the audience every answer, ""Anatomy of a Fall"" excels in its embrace of ambiguity. This approach is refreshing and thought-provoking, as it invites the audience to grapple with the same uncertainties and lack of closure that the characters face. The movie hooks you in with courtroom exchanges that are as intense as they are revealing. As the legal proceedings unfold, the dialogue chips away at the polished exterior of marriage to reveal the hidden cracks-resentment, unspoken pain, jealousy, and the burdens of comparison. Sandra Hüller delivers a tour-de-force performance, with a portrayal that is both commanding and nuanced. Her ability to transition from a façade of strength to a state of emotional fracture is nothing short of remarkable, solidifying her status as a formidable talent and a potential Oscar contender. One standout scene that encapsulates this nuanced storytelling occurs when Sandra's character, in a moment of vulnerability, reflects on the concept of time and its impact on her marriage. The discussion seems casual at first but later reveals a profound scar in their relationship. It's a slow burn that rewards viewers with profound insights into the couple's relationship. In dissecting the institution of marriage, the film is unflinching and insightful. It doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable truths or the complexities inherent in the compromises of married life. Instead, it dives deep, presenting these realities in a manner that resonates with an adult audience who can appreciate the emotional gravity of what's at stake. The cinematography in ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is cleverly deceptive. It presents itself as a neutral observer, offering what seems to be an objective point of view. However, visual storytelling is deeply subjective, drawing the audience into an emotional journey that is both personal and universal. ""Anatomy of a Fall"" is a triumph of cinema, where every narrative beat, technical flourish, and creative decision coalesce into a seamless whole. It is a movie that not only entertains but also challenges its audience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),One of the Perfect Film that I will wrote a Novel Inspried from this film,"Anatomy of a Fall was a Perfect Crime Thriller by Justine Triet that followed the story of a German Woman who was accused of Murdering a Husband. I Love this Film and. I planned to write a crime novel inspired by this film set in Minnesota in the winter of the early 2000s during the American invasion of Iraq. I know that this film is perfect and should win an Oscar-Anatomy of a Fall was a perfect film that should won an Oscar and Golden Globe and I know that this film is one of the most ideal crime thrillers films that came from this Country France, one of the Cinema Captial of the world and Europe."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),Not a convincing mystery,"This film wasn't as thrilling as the reviews lead me to believe. The opening sequence with the P. I. M. P. song was so annoying even though I know it was done intentionally. The acting was good but I was never drawn into the mystery. I always felt like I knew what the conclusion would be even when the film tried to steer away from it. Even when the film concluded I was not convinced by the final verdict because it just didn't make sense. In my opinion, the fact that the boy was blind didn't aid the movie much. This film dragged a couple of times and I just didn't care for it when it ended. I would say it's highly overrated."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),anatomy of a fall,"This film is a glorious exception to the rule that if a movie attempts to do too many things in its two hour time span then it will be disappointing. Not only is this film a gripping courtroom drama, the best I've seen since that previous ""Anatomy"", directed by Preminger, it is also a most acute examination of a miserable marriage as well as an uneasy mother/son relationship. That co writer and director Justine Triet manages to give moving, convincing renditions of each of these three subjects without putting undue strain upon my patience (I was never close to being bored) heralds, in my opinion, a most promising career. I definitely look forward to the next film by Ms. Triet and will, hopefully, be able to view her prior ones. And the lead actor, Sandra Huller, just may swoop in and make off with the Oscar. It also has, thrown in free of charge, the best dog performance in a film since ""Sounder"". Give it an A. PS...Remind me to never get arrested in France. Its legal system is, if this film can be trusted, more than a bit on the chaotic side. With an alarming tolerance for speculation. To mention nothing of witnesses viewing the trial!"
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),Anatomy of a modern day relationship,"The scene where they had an argument was the climax. I felt as if we are doing it with my gf. It felt very genuine and real to me. I easily put myself in the main character's shoes. It's also the anatomy of a modern day relationship to me. The movie's begining is very captivating. Perfectly done. I loved the directing and the whole script. As for the whole tragedy of the husband killing himself and the mother being the one who is getting blamed for murder, they barely dramatized it, there was no unnecessarely tragic agitation of a story but they rather told the whole thing very as it was supposed to be told. I felt for the characters, never felt anything cheesy. Perfectly was emphatic with every character except the prosecutor who usually took the matters way far with ridiculous attempts to make the woman as the killer but that's just what they do anyway... All In all, I think it was perfect. Maybe could do without the last few mins of ending but still a perfect movie."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),Another Practical Joke on the Audience,"This movie has lively production values, a good script (up to a point) and fine performances, but ultimately becomes a disappointing failure for the most banal reason of all. The plot is unresolved. The central question is whether the victim of the fall committed suicide or was pushed by his wife. Most of the action of the drama takes place in the trial of the mater, in Grenoble in France. Ultimately the wife on trial is acquitted of her husband's murder - THAT we do know. But was she in fact guilty? Did she get away with a homicide? The director/screenwriter does not see fit to tell us. You'll read plenty of reviews, both here and in professional reviews, that blandly conclude 'it's for the viewer to decide'. Sorry . . . No. That's a perfectly reasonable conclusion in real life. In fact, in highly contested historical controversies, often it's the only responsible position. But this isn't real life or history. It's a movie, a story, a fiction told by a storyteller - and stories are supposed to have endings. You don't quit the tale with Cinderella about to try on the slipper and leave it to the reader to decide if it fits or not. Even in the superb 'Rashomon', the four different versions of the event are all rounded and complete. The uncertainty arises because the perspectives are so profoundly different. Here, however, the director/screenwriter, whether out of laziness or some screwed up notion of cinematic sophistication, simply fails to round out the narrative, The result is a frustrating audience experience, and an artistic failure, despite all the pluses."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),Did they see the same film?,"Count me in, among the cheering section for this fine, carefully plotted, awards-worthy film. It was an unexpected treat to be reminded of a television show vividly remembered from almost 70 years ago,  Never Comes Sunday (1955) . It, too had an eleven-year-old, special needs child whose crippling injury wounded the parents' marriage, and whose music-making furnished film music from inside the frame. But I have to say that the anglophone viewers of Anatomy of a Fall misunderstand where the French criminal justice and child welfare systems stand in all this. In that supposedly non-adversarial setup, there is no formal standard of proof and no formal rules of evidence. The facts of Sandra's case all lend themselves to an innocent as well as a guilty interpretation. It is possible but improbable that she is guilty. Samuel might or might not have been killed by a blow to the head from a large, strong, left-handed person. Sandra is none of those. Nonetheless, she is subjected to a trial. If a French prosecutor can convince the other court officers to go along, he may get a conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or even preponderance of the evidence. He doesn't even need to procure false testimony to proceed. Does anyone think Sandra would have been brought to trial had she been French? How could anyone not be offended by the way the judge and the social worker browbeat the handicapped juvenile witness, while bloviating about the fairness of what they are doing? Where the everyday outcome in the USA system is a plea deal, the usual outcome in the French one is a court meeting over the extensive paper work that the investigative phase generates, and trying to work out a middle-of-the-road solution. But it is altogether possible there, for a case to degenerate into a hot mess of hearsay testimony and wild speculation as is portrayed in this film. Where  Anatomy of a Murder (1959)  was a paean to a system working as it should, this film should be taken as an indictment of a very broken system. The film rightly shows what cold comfort an acquittal can be, after people have been overrun by a system out of control."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),"Mediocre, overrated, dishonest","It's a courtroom drama interspersed.with marital issues flashbacks. There's little if any artistry in it, with a verite style that aims for a realistic approach both in the supporting cast and some of handheld camera movements. Huller's acting is correct but not on the same level of, say, Toni Erdmann. The other main actors are ok too, with the prosecutor's tour de force being the most impressive of all. Other than that, it's an entirely run of the mill story and its heavyhanded identitary undertones seem to be geared towards emphasizing male ""weakness"" as opposed to woman's creative and say, intimate ""assertiveness"". The husband is depicted as stuck whereas the woman is a liberated type. It also overrelies on emotional aspects and ""feelz"" to the detriment of assessing the real facts. Overall, it's tedious and a movie whose ""message"" has to be seen with a level-headed wariness and suspicion."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),Simple Elegance,"An exquisitely layered mystery unfolded in this unpredictably intelligent movie about a woman whose husband died from a terrible accident and drew suspicion onto her. Sandra Hüller's performance as Sandra Voyter was flawless. She carried the entire movie without once creating a slump in suspense. Her blind son Daniel (played by Milo Machado Graner) added to the storytelling brilliance in ""Anatomy of a Fall"". This French-origin movie was extraordinary, even by their cinema standards. Agatha Christie (if she were still alive) would've enjoyed watching this one a few times over. Samuel Theis played the dead father, Samuel Maleski. Though he was absent for most of the plot - except in vital flashbacks - his spirit (pun unintended) made its presence felt in interesting ways. Samuel's perspectives (when alive) made him feel his wife was ""imposing"" on him. His words, though whingey, held empathic value. Sandra's lawyer, Vincent Renzi (played by Swann Arlaud), the prosecution lawyer (played by Antoine Reinartz), a subject-matter-expert named Bogaert (played by Anne-Lise Heimburger), and Judge Bollène (played by Cécile Brunet-Ludet) were all remarkable characters. It gradually became unclear whether Samuel committed suicide or was, for reasons yet to be verified, murdered by his own wife. In the movie's two-and-a-half-hour runtime, the way they maintained intrigue and intensity was a lesson in filmmaking excellence. A full-fledged courtroom trial also unfolded, adding to the script's value while also emphasizing the significance of eleven-year-old Daniel's contribution to the case. The fact that Sandra was a novelist made the whole thing feel slippery and compelling. After all, if she was indeed lying about murdering her husband, she could easily come up with any number of credible causes and 'storytelling' reasons to establish her innocence. In fact, her books were based on her own life and were used to define her culpability, or lack thereof. This was what I most loved about ""Anatomy of a Fall"". It took such an extremely simple and elegant premise and made it near-impossible for almost anyone to predict 'whodunnit'. Now I know Agatha Christie would've liked this movie, more so considering that it's an original screenplay. The movie also ended on a sub-textual note, specifically how such cases favour the dead male victim rather than the living female one. Justine Triet and Arthur Harari have much to be proud of with this one. ""Anatomy of a Fall"" will be talked about in writers' and filmmakers' circles for a long time. The entire plot revolved around one simple accident and one relatable motive, and therein lay the genius of ""Anatomy of a Fall"". It cleverly emulated that famed phrase, 'When it rains, it pours'."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023),The Anatomy of Dissolution,"This is a chilling and haunting movie, and not so much of a physical fall but of an emotional and psychological dissolution of a relationship. It wasn't even about infidelity or lack of respect, but of something even more troublesome. A total lack of trust that develops over time with another soul. There is an aching that comes from the reality of human relationships and what happens when people turn their backs on each other. A psychological and emotional isolation that hurts so deeply. So, what starts out as a crime case turns into a forensic investigation of a marriage and personality dynamics. There was something about this movie that reminded me of Force Majeur...a similar theme but with deadlier consequences. Yet, at the end of this movie, I was still wondering ""did she do it?"""
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Entertainment Mystery,"If your a fan of the series or murder mysteries in general that make you think a little during the movie you will enjoy this. My wife and I both thought the movie had a good pace with enough plot twists and parallel lines that it kept our interest and engagement the entire movie. While we had pretty well figured it out about three quarters of the way through the movie, it still held our attention and was entertaining. We both also thought the acting was really good for all of the characters except Tina Fey's performance which we both thought was subpar and lack luster at best. Full disclosure neither of us have ever been impressed with her acting."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),My least favorite of the 3 new Poirot movies,"One of the things that's noticeable right away is the lack of star power in this movie compared to the previous two. Tina Fey is expected to do a lot of the heavy lifting, and I don't know if this was the right role for her. I think for me I didn't enjoy this one as much as the other two because it had a little bit more of a horror vibe than the others. It was trying hard to make you as unsettled as Poirot was. It does do a decent job of keeping you guessing as to who is responsible for these murders. And I liked that it was pretty short, not much more than 90 minutes. Other than that, I'd say meh."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),So disappointing,"I was willing to hope that the other reviews were right, that this would be better than the other two, but it follows in their footsteps, changing things unnecessarily, being deliberately confusing instead of complex and thought provoking. The camera work was dizzying, and artistic to the sacrifice of comprehenstion. The actors/writing couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a drama. Even the dramatic lines were delivered melodramatically, over the top, and cringy. But worst of all was how disrespectful it was toward Agatha Christie's characters and stories. Branagh used to be so passionate about the source material, so precise, so dedicated. But these Poirot films have disappointed on so many levels. I tried to set aside my love of Christie and Poirot and watch it through ""clean"" eyes, but the camera work and dramatics still made the film a bit much."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Really,Poirot is one of my favorites. This was the worst representation of the famed detective I've seen. Except for the 10 minute reveal it was a waste of my money and yours if you entertain the thought of purchasing it. Save your money there are better offerings out there. I see my review is too short? Mmmmm what they should have shortened was this film. Sometimes the most informative review is short and to the point. Which should have been considered in the production of this effort. There really is little else to say. Don't waste your evening? Save your money for popcorn? Basically just avoid this film. Hurrah I've met the limit.
A Haunting in Venice (2023),This haunting mystery is anything but 'cosy crime',"Kenneth Branagh's third outing as Hercule Poirot takes an original Agatha Christie story (Hallowe'en Party) and mixes-in some James Wan-ish horror to give a mystery best watched with the lights on. A now-retired Poirot is asked by his friend Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey) to attend a seance at the palazzo of a retired opera singer (Kelly Reilly), said to be haunted by the ghosts of children left to die when the plague swept through the city during the palazzo's days as an orphanage. Ariadne wants Poirot to help expose the medium (Michelle Yeoh) as a fake. Poirot soon spots chicanery, but events suddenly take a turn towards the seemingly real supernatural. Have the dead returned to take murderous revenge on the living? Or is a more human agency at work? What follows is a journey through accusations, alibis, red herrings... and ghosts. Who's guilty? What's real - and what isn't? The answers may not be as cut-and-dried as you'd expect. Although Branagh is a talented actor, he generally misses the mark for me. But here he's excellent, as Poirot struggles to get to grips with what he knows cannot exist. Tina Fey, whilst not someone I would cast as Ariadne, does a good job. Michelle Yeoh convinces as the medium. Kelly Reilly is okay as the former opera singer. The rest of the featured cast (Jamie Dornan, Kyle Allen, Riccardo Scamarcio, Camille Cottin, and young Jude Hill) are all very good. Branagh's direction is tight, and he handles the supernatural aspects well (I'd like to see him tackle an out and out ghost story - something along the lines of The Woman in Black). The film was largely shot on location, and the cinematography makes the most of the Venice scenery. The minus for me is that either the mystery distracts from the ghost story, or the ghost story distracts from the mystery; they don't quite fit together. It feels like two unrelated stories spliced together (which it basically is). Nevertheless, there's plenty to enjoy - and Branagh has an eye for the creepy. 7/10."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Decent watch but not suitable for horror,"First of all I have never read any of the books, however I watched both predecessors and generally enjoyed them, especially Murder on Orient Express. Death on the Nile was good too but I think it was more flawed and less stylish. So I was really excited to see Poirot in yet another movie, especially since is was tagged as horror which is my favorite genre. Sadly I have to say that the movie rather disappointed me. It definitely wasn't terrible and it had its franchise trademarks but in general I don't think that it was as good as it could have been. The horror aspects mostly didn't work and were rather hilarious than scary or realistic and just didn't fit in. Also I think that the reveal was unspectacular and slightly predictable. But despite all my whining I think that in general I still like the movie. I had fun watching and trying to figure out more clues about who the killer is, I just think that they could have done so much better. [6,3/10]"
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Feels quite low budget and 'Sunday afternoon TV movie'.,"The worst entry, by far, in the recent Agatha Christie revival featuring Kenneth Branagh and that mustache, 'A Haunting In Venice' is packed full of cliched camera angles, cheesy jump scares and quite a bit of overacting and underacting - neither of which are fun to watch. I seem to recall Branagh being quite good in the other films, but he feels somewhat deflated here and lacking the necessary charisma. He's a complete star though in comparison to Tina Fey who looks like someone who has won a competition to visit on set, she appears in far too many scenes contributing nothing but a rather smug grin and looking totally out of place. Michelle Yeoh overplays an equally annoying character whilst Jamie Dornan struggles to convey torment. Riccardo Scarmaccio looks born to feature in this film, with that haunting face, but is rather underused. These films aren't intended to be realistic - more glossy, tongue-in-cheek fun, but the laughs were all unintended here. I can't say how closely this follows the source material, but the central plot is a bit lacking. Poirot's back story doesn't develop much either. Younger audience members might find it a bit scary (and original), but the older ones may be rolling their eyes or stifling a yawn and many will 'solve the case' way before Poirot does."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Why?,"I am afraid Sir Kenneth is aiming at doing all of Christie's material, finally reapearing as Miss Marple in the end. There is no shortage movie versions of her whodunnits and one needs to improve previous versions if another couple of bucks are spent. This doesn't seem to be the case with Branagh's efforts. This time he found out about weird camera angles (German or Dutch angles, if you prefer the professional terms) and repeats some Scary Movie gimmicks, but is this suffice to star and direct another lengthy and dull movie just to have some nice plot turns at the end, when nobody listens to details anymore having left the theater or consciousness."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),Haunting in Venice,"6.8/10 Although this movie tried a mix of horror and mystery, its kidna like it failed in both aspects. The horror part isn't that scar (im not sure if its intended to be scary) and the mystery part isn't that exciting either. In the past 2 movies whenever the main murder happens, we as audience have a curiosity on who killed the person. But in this movie a character that is disliked by many characters ends up dying, Ok and? All the characters who die in the movie, one of them is disliked by majority of the cast and the next one is some random girl who died so long ago and then one random guy who always give the weird feeling. This is the 3rd movie of a trilogy and so supposedly in every movie the great Hercule Poirot is going to ""retire"" and supposedly rejects every case, but then suddenly case comes up and he ends up solving it although he himself says like 10 times in the movie that he is going to retire. And the 'friend' of Poirot in the movie always points it out too saying stuff like ""Oh he was Hercule Poirot"" to show how he was gonna retire. Then the main thing that bothered me was the camera angles. Dutch angle is basically to create distortion or to show something is not right, but in this movie its used in every other scene that it loses its own motive
And then ofc the weird head shots which genuinely looks like those .5 pics we take. The motion tracking of Poirot during the basement scene had no use, it seemed like the director wanted to experiment but he failed to do so in the right places. I liked the first person pov shot to sell in the illusion of the hallway being really long. The acting of the cast is really good and the kid actor who is supposed to act like the creepy kid really sells its. Kenneth Branagh plays the character of Hercule Poirot really goddamn good."
A Haunting in Venice (2023),The worst of Branagh's Poirot movies - but still decent.,"This is easily the worst of Kenneth Branagh's Poirot movies. The story doesn't hold together quite as well as either Murder on the Orient Express or Death on the Nile - which were well crafted mysteries with tightly told narratives. This, by comparison, is somewhat of a mess of ideas that only barely manages to come together in the end. Let me start by saying what I liked about this... the acting and directing are very well done - as is to be expected. The movie is a visual treat with lots of nice set design throughout. And in the end, it is a decent enough murder mystery that's sort of vaguely in the style of a proper Hercule Poirot story. That last bit is kind of the issue though. At times, this is crafted such that it *really* feels like a proper Hercule Poirot story... but at other times it feels like a Scooby Doo episode. The movie leans too heavily toward the ""haunting"" aspect of the title - and while some of these ""spooky / haunting"" moments are explained away at the end, some of them simply *CANNOT* be explained away. Upon the conclusion of this movie I immediately researched to see if the original Agatha Christie novel featured this absurd ambiguity surrounding the ""haunting"" aspect of this film - only to find that there is no such Agatha Christie novel at all. This movie is only very loosely based on a totally different Agatha Christie novel that features no such ridiculous haunting aspects. While I can appreciate the desire to tell a story that goes in a different direction than Agatha Christie fans might expect - I feel like they pushed a little too far into Scooby Doo territory to be taken seriously. That having been said though, I mostly enjoyed the movie despite some of these issues and I would absolutely recommend it for folks who liked the first two films. But if you're only going to watch one of them - then stick with either of the first two movies because they're both better than this one."
The Batman (2022),Best comic book film,"HOW IS THIS NOT MA?! THIS PUSHES the M rating, and The Dark Knight did too, but this, this was something else. This is a gift to all comic book fans. THIS is the movie we deserve, not some crappy Suicide Squad movie with a bad Joker, THIS is a FANTASTIC Batman movie with a SCARY Riddler. If someone told me this was MA, I would have believed them, until I would have seen the actual rating, and then I would be very shocked. This is my favourite movie of all time. Final Scores:
Plot: 9/10. Acting: 10/10. Music: 10/10. Action: 10/10. Cinematography: 10/10. Overall: 10/10. Best comic book movie."
The Batman (2022),The best batman we've had(all my opinion),"I understand that there's a lot of you who believe the dark knight is the best Batman movie and now I do agree with some parts of that. For example the joker is the best batman villain we've had but the best batman we've had is Robin Paterson's. The way he brings a dark atmosphere in the scene defeats Christopher Nolan batman completely, also keep in mind this Matt Reeves plans more movies for his batman trilogy so this could just get better, also keep in mind the Christopher Nolan trilogy had 1 really good movie in the middle and 2 decent ones at the start/end
Again all my opinion. Thanks 🙏🏿"
The Batman (2022),"""Batman"" is a huge film, both in length and plot, a noir adaptation focused more on the detective side of our hero, such as ""The Long Halloween"", ""Year Zero"" and ""Year One""","Reeves acts as a conductor in love with his orchestra, in this case, his perspective on the best version of Batman and Gotham. Bearing in mind the need to build a traumatized detective working in an oppressive environment, the screenwriter also uses all his resources to, alongside Peter Craig, bring to life a narrative meticulously thought out to serve as a new origin for Batman in cinemas. If you saw the title when you bought your ticket, you probably already have in your memory passages such as the death of Bruce Wayne's parents or the beginning of the hero's role in fighting crime. In this way, Reeves wastes no time recreating these sequences and tries to use the opening minutes of the work to take us on a deep dive into the darkness of Gotham. Although the city already has a Batman established in his crusade against crime - whose ""omnipresent"" ghost imposes fear among criminals -, the character has been active for just over two years, always showing his growing impatience and revolt. The director's vision is uniform for all aspects of the film, showing the solidity of the project even with all its ambitions. Unlike more recent adaptations, which involved Christopher Nolan's realism and Zack Snyder's mythology, Reeves constructs the atmosphere of the work as a dark and pessimistic portrait of today's society. To this end, he stops using a traditional dramatic crescendo leading to a climax, and prefers to transform the long duration into a constant line - constantly hammering into our heads with that place where very few are worthy of salvation. An easy-to-observe example of this concept is the use of light by cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Dune""). While most of the scenes take place at night, with the creative team making use of shadows as an active character in the film, the daytime sequences appear to have been sucked in, as if Gotham had no right to have anything alive - not even colors. Still in this approach, it is worth highlighting the use of red and orange tones in scenes where the darkness is illuminated by these colors (be it the flare or the fire), reflecting not only the bloodthirsty of the place, but also Batman's explosive personality, still impulsive and believing that anonymity gives him the freedom to do what he wants. Fraser's photography also adopts a reduced depth of field or even slightly blurred planes, using resources such as smoke or constant rain to limit the viewer's vision - thus illustrating the oppressive and claustrophobic world inhabited by those people. Robert Pattinson plays Batman masterfully, and his interpretation makes it clear that Bruce Wayne uses his alter ego as escapism to escape his still recent traumas. Not by chance, the character spends the vast majority of the almost 3-hour running time (which could certainly be reduced) dressed as Batman. Sounding depressed and pessimistic, Wayne speaks little and in a low voice, maintaining an emotional distance even from his loyal butler and father figure Alfred (who Andy Serkis plays with a mix of affection and impatience) - and on the few occasions we see the billionaire Without his uniform, he demonstrates pragmatism by exchanging his suits and tuxedos for a cap and backpack, which allows him to walk around the city incognito, but always ready to put on his mask when necessary. Of the same, the flashy batbike from Christopher Nolan's films gives way to a common, discreet version, while the batmobile discards the stylized design to present itself as a vehicle that appears to be made of reinforced metal and that Reeves presents as if it were a monstrous creature out of from a cave to scare the villains. The existence of Bruce Wayne seems to be a mere formality in the film, and the little development given to him uses layers very similar (not to say exactly the same) to Batman. It is understandable that spending so much time on a mission means that, without the uniform, the character continues to act and think like the hero. However, all the emotional appeal that Bruce carries with him, as well as the important asymmetry between the millionaire and the vigilante were left aside. There is certainly room to develop him better, especially if we take into account that this is a film with a backwards origin, in which the protagonist begins the narrative as a disbelieving Batman in Gotham and spreading fear, and we see his journey of ""redemption"" to become a figure of hope for everyone. Returning to the beginning, the opening also fulfills a second and equally important purpose: to introduce the film's villain. And there is no one in Batman's considerable pantheon of antagonists who invokes the need for a resourceful detective as much as the Riddler. Especially when behind the mask, the character synthesizes the antithesis of the method and detail of a serial killer with the chaos provided by a mass agitator. All of this wrapped in a web that mixes past and present traumas with the desire to impose gigantic changes in the future. Paul Dano's Riddler not only has fun while spreading riddles to cover his tracks, but he also shows that he knows communication methods and strategies and knows how to use them to his advantage and always be ahead of those who investigate him. It is worth highlighting the parallel that can be made between the villain's final strategy and real life, rekindling the warning about the danger of the expansion of forums and websites that shamelessly disseminate the most execrable ideas ever produced by human beings. However, no matter how different ""Batman"" tries to be, there is no way to ignore that he was born in comics. And Reeves is not ashamed to embrace what the medium has to offer and takes great care of the action and intensity of everything that is happening. So much so that, even though it's a terribly long film, it's easy to enjoy the more than three hours amidst so much happening. The big highlight here are the fight scenes. They are all very well-choreographed and put together in a dry and very raw way, without the acrobatics and exaggerations of other productions. The idea here is to get closer to a street fight, with a crazy person dressed as a bat beating up criminals in dark alleys. Likewise, the entire Batmobile scene is incredible precisely because it is not afraid to accelerate towards the surreal for the sake of good entertainment. Okay, Batman caused dozens of accidents and a pileup that could have killed a lot of people, but everything is so visually impressive that you just accept it and cheer when you see the vehicle come out of the flames in the middle of a chase that is as long as it is exciting. As already mentioned, in addition to psychological horror, the film also uses several noir elements: many dark tones and shadows combined with white in the aesthetics (Gotham is almost always dark and rainy) and beautiful photography. The detective investigation that goes from piece to piece, to discover who the killer is and why he commits such crimes and a main character with many internal demons and pessimistic views about the city he protects. Unlike several previous works, one of the points of the film is not to show how Bruce decided to become a vigilante - we don't have the fateful alley scene shown at any point in the film, but rather to show his detective skills in contrast to the emotional shaken by his personal tragedy. Fans of the comics will easily be able to see that the basis of the script is influenced by stories from the beginning of his career and focused more on the detective side of our hero, such as ""The Long Halloween"", ""Year Zero"" and ""Year One"". ""Batman"" is a huge film, both in length and plot, with a somewhat slow initial pace, which may bother viewers eager for immediate action, as well as pleasing those who prefer a good narrative development with everything perfectly connected. . Of course, it could be shorter and the story more condensed, but when misfortunes happen, this ends up becoming just a detail. Despite this, the film rescues elements of the character that are sometimes neglected in his more recent stories, uniting them with a degree of realism: Gotham is a large and violent city (inspired by real cities of great corruption, such as Chicago) whose heroic protector, at the beginning of his career, is someone who uses intelligence and creativity, gathers clues to crimes, infiltrates places where there are likely suspects and, instead of fighting invincible ninjas or aliens, faces robbers and other lesser street thugs. Grandiose, exposing the rampant corruption and violence present in the city. It's a good adaptation of more down-to-earth Bat-Man stories, but it still maintains its own originality that hadn't yet been so well explored in cinemas and that must stand on its own two feet with the ""DC Elseworlds"" seal on upcoming new DCU in theaters to be led by James Gunn."
The Batman (2022),EXCELLENT!,"The Batman is by far the BEST of all the Batman films to date. Never been a fan of Robert Pattinson or Zoe Kravitz until I saw this movie. In fact, the whole cast was superb. John Turturro is always great. And Colin Farrell was outstanding as the Penguin. It could have been easy for any one of these actors to have taken their role to a caricature level but each performance was nuanced. I did not feel like I was watching a film representation of a comic. Matt Reeves's script and direction resulted in a stand-alone story which made me forget there had been other movie interpretations. I was hesitant to see it due to an almost three-hour run time, but I never once checked my watch."
The Batman (2022),Master class in how to ruin a beloved character,"Ishtar was better. Waterworld was better. Gigli was better. This is in the running for the worst movie ever made. It was way too long. Plot was terrible. Nothing happens for what seems like hours. I didn't pay to watch it and I still want my money back. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! The acting is mostly terrible. Pattinson is not believable as Batman. The villains are one dimensional. Kravitz as Catwoman is the lone bright spot. However bad the acting is, the script worse. The whole thing is about three hours too long (which is impressive for a the hour movie). The editing was clearly done by a depressed, crack smoking monkey as that is the only way to explain the sheer insanity that is the bloated length of this monstrosity."
The Batman (2022),The Batman: A Visually Striking Journey Marred by an Incongruous Finale,"""The Batman"" emerges as a visually striking and atmospherically rich interpretation of the iconic superhero. The film's grim, dark tone sets a captivating stage, enhanced by stunning visuals that perfectly encapsulate Gotham's brooding essence. The actors deliver standout performances, bringing fresh depth to familiar characters. Notably, the action sequences are intense and expertly crafted, adding to the film's gripping nature. However, the movie's final act deviates sharply from its established tone, presenting a jarring contrast. This segment feels almost like a caricature of a Batman movie, lacking the subtlety and coherence of the earlier parts. This incongruity mars what could have been a consistently powerful rendition of the Batman saga. As such, while the film starts strong and offers a refreshing take on the superhero, its concluding portion leaves a mixed impression, detracting from the overall experience."
The Batman (2022),Not bad. Maybe a bit too long.,"I watched The Batman last night on Netflix. When I started I didn't realize it was 3 hours long. Oof! Well. I did make it to the end. It's a good movie. I sort of mash up all the different Batmans (Batmen?). I don't really think of the fact the actors change is a problem. I like Bale as an actor so I liked his Batman. This guy Pattinson is good. I've not watched the twilight movies so he was new to me. You get to see a whole lot of him as Batman, and a little as Bruce. He does have a presence. It's interesting to what how he physically changes as he moves back and forth between Batman and Bruce. It's a very noir movie. More of a detective story than anything. It's quite clever in how it's done. And the Riddler role is pretty awesome. I don't know the comics. I did watch and love the series ""Gotham"" and so the plot here is familiar because of that. I know the basic story already from Gotham. I loved Gotham and throughout watching The Batman I kept being reminded of it and especially the Riddler and Penguin characters (Gotham was just so fun and campy). I think if I'd not watched Gotham I might have struggled a bit with what is going on in the fourth act of The Batman. The Batman is grim and dark. The fourth act comes out of nowhere and feels weirdly disjointed. I knew it was coming of course (sic) but by then you're way over two hours in and pretty much worn out. Still there's a hint of a sequel. I would watch it. I'm also tempted to watch some of my favorite Gotham eps again. I recommend this movie with the caveat there's some violence and that it is long. Really long."
The Batman (2022),"Wow, 3hrs of Just Awful : (","READ THIS FIRST: although Robert Pattinson has done some very good movies, his brooding along with everything else they asked of him in this film is absolutely dreadful. It's made even worse by Jeffrey Wright's astonishing ass kissing portrayal of Commissioner Gordon. Alfred does a good job and Colin Farrell's penguin is quite impressive but it's so poorly written and fit into the script that it's a completely wasted device and pointless avenue of the story. Scenery and set design although extremely dystopian and bleak is also somehow a little warm and very lavish. It's for the few upsides to this absolute dumpster fire. At 2 hours into the movie you know your life would have been better had you stopped watching an hour ago and then you realize you have one more hour to go still. At this point, the best ending to the movie might be a warm bath and a toaster. Skip this film, or maybe watch the first half hour if you want a clear understanding of what wasting a half hour is."
The Batman (2022),What I think of Robert Pattinson,"Robert Pattinson has destroyed the Batman franchise. He is a terrible and undoubtedly the worst actor who's played Batman. I don't understand why they would chose someone who looks like he's going through puberty to play such an iconic character. Robert, please step away from playing any superhero characters in the future. You've ruined the reputation of an amazing character. Aside from the huge eyesore throughout the movie, I believe this film had a great story line. To the director Matt Reeves going forward, if I may suggest I would use someone like Robert Pattinson to start in the next Planet of the Apes film as an extra. Matt I'm truly grateful you did not get to ruin Man of Steel."
The Batman (2022),The worst of the Batman movies,"Title: A Dark Descent into Cinematic Chaos The recent Batman movie, touted as a beacon of superhero cinema, is nothing short of a catastrophic disappointment. From the opening credits to the final scene, this film manages to obliterate any expectations one might have had for a coherent and engaging storyline. Let's start with the screenplay, an incoherent mess that seems to have been cobbled together by a group of amateurs in a hurry to meet a deadline. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, with characters spouting off lines that feel like rejected scraps from a high school drama class. Batman, once an iconic symbol of brooding intensity, now comes off as a caricature of himself, uttering lines that are more likely to induce laughter than fear. The film's attempt at a dark and gritty atmosphere falls flat on its face. Instead of a nuanced exploration of the psychological depths of the Caped Crusader, we're treated to a haphazard collection of dimly lit scenes that do nothing to enhance the overall mood. It's as if the filmmakers mistook shadows for substance, leaving the audience squinting in confusion rather than leaning forward in anticipation. And let's not forget the so-called plot twists that feel more like desperate attempts to salvage a sinking ship. The narrative is riddled with contrivances that strain credulity, leaving the viewer wondering if the writers even bothered to think through the implications of their choices. Any semblance of logical progression is sacrificed for the sake of shock value, resulting in a story that feels disjointed and unsatisfying. The cinematography, touted as a highlight by some, is nothing more than a misguided attempt at artistic flair. The excessive use of shaky cam and frenetic editing serves only to induce nausea rather than immerse the audience in the action. It's a shame that the visuals become a distraction, as there is little else to salvage from this cinematic wreckage. In conclusion, the latest Batman movie is a train wreck of epic proportions. From the abysmal screenplay to the muddled cinematography, every aspect of this film contributes to its descent into mediocrity. Die-hard fans of the Dark Knight may find themselves questioning their allegiance after enduring this cinematic travesty. Save yourself the agony and skip this disastrous chapter in the Batman franchise."
Finestkind (2023),Please...,"Dear Hollywood,
If you want to know how blue collar hardworking people act and talk, try doing some research and meeting some instead of guessing. You clearly have no clue. Pretty much sums up the film. A horrible story of what people ""think"" us poor working folk are like. Disgusting display of how Hollywood views society outside their bubble. There is no depth to these characters past stereotypical cliches. Most of people don't have rich parents that offer them options, like college, law school, and clerking, beyond this type of work. They do it because they have to, not to ""find"" themselves. Some great actors and actresses, just a really bad script, disjointed story and unreal dialogue. The performers past work is why I gave more than one star. Most of these people are good, but in other things. After the ship sank and they were joking and laughing while being rescued and then went straight to the bar to party, I knew the writers had no clue. Do the creators have any idea how bad it is for a captain and crew that lost their vessel? Let me just say they would not be joking and partying. Please..."
Finestkind (2023),It's bad,"Acting is bad, plot is bad, and it doesn't get better. I gave it a chance because I kept seeing some reviews saying that it was actually good or that at some point it took a different direction but it never did. From the beginning it had what I can only describe as ""fast and the furious"" of fishing and I was not wrong. Filed up with the usual cliches, store bought situations and, of course, the usual ""he has cancer"" point in the plot. The only reason I kept watching past the hour mark was because I wanted to double check if I was right about the negative comments that usually tell me the movie is not good or if I was being judgy."
Finestkind (2023),Like watching a Sam Adams commercial,"I'm from New Bedford. The accents were horrendous. We don't sound like that. It was like listening to SNL skit with Fallon and Dratch. No mention of Portuguese community (almost EVERYONE is Portuguese here), other than a cookout with linguica. No real storyline. Waste of Tim Daly's talent. Scenery was beautiful. I recognized every shot! Editing, acting, writing all bad, including TLJ. Painfully long. Insulting to the actual residents of the New Bedford area. Ortega was driving on the bike trail....yeah that's realistic. They had the potential to be amazing, and blew it. Fishing is indeed dangerous. The scenes at sea looked completely CGI. Skip this and watch reruns of Cheers and Wings if you want to see Massachusetts."
Finestkind (2023),Predictable but Done Better,"This starts out as others have said, a little slow. Some viewers may feel they can predict the plot line and some viewers will be right. But being from Maine and having known fisherman, the new Bedford filming location is perfect and the choice of actors was well done. Having two of the leads coming from the Boston area helped the other actors lend authenticity to their characters. Their performances were very strong. They portray the toughness of those in the fishing community very well. Adding Tommy Lee Jones to the cast was a good addition. I would have given this a 7.5 but I don't know how. Watch it. You'll be glad you did."
Finestkind (2023),"Not bad, not great.","My only big complaint is the movie takes a sudden turn in tone about half an hour in. Like Mabel's outlash didn't completely make sense or felt out of the blue. We'd only spent like a minute with her, maybe we should have gotten to know her a little bit more. But other than that I don't think the movie was too bad, but it's not anything remarkable either. I just wasn't as bored as other people seem to have been. It's an okay watch, had a solid story. Maybe the father-son and step-brother relations could've been explored deeper, it felt like the movie was just telling a story which was somewhat interesting, but didn't hit the emotional chords for me. There's a little decent love story going on and personally I'm a sucker for those so I'm a little more upset than warranted about this next bit. It's just upsetting that almost ever time Mabel popped it, it always felt like the writers thought we already know all about her, more than we actually do, we barely spent anytime with her but when she's on screen she's like the focus of the movie, her issues. Jenna Ortega was much better than Mabel, she should've been written way better. But in general, I could say that about all the actors, it felt like they thought they were in a much better movie. But the movies okay. It's sort of feels like two movies in one. Maybe more. From all the subplots, you could probably make two or three movies out of it that were more insightful and took a deeper dive into the characters, their lives, their relationships and dilemmas. Instead it's all neatly parked into one forgettable one. I think it should've picked one genre and maybe leaned into it more, making it a crime thriller, romance or family drama, just to give the movie more character. The movie just felt like it's made up of sub plots. I didn't hate it, I wasn't bored, and I've seen much worse. Felt indifferent to it."
Finestkind (2023),Twisted take on NE fishermen,"This was enjoyable movie. Yes a lot takes place but it all has its conclusion and closure. The open plots that actually lead somewhere and are closed. For all it does, the movie does not leave loose ends and i applaud it for it. The cast does good enough and characters are well written. You get a good idea about each pretty fast and they remain consistent throughout. This is part drama, part adventure, part crime, part love story, part fishing documentary. It has it all and it really works at the end, surprisingly enough. Perhaps one of the big aspects is that it is a feel good movie ultimately and leaves you content at the end. I understand if you compare it to THE PERFECT STORM expecting hardcore fishing life simulator you will be disappointed. This is not it. This is a movie about a fishing boat crew that get in a spiral of trouble and dig out of it through various ways. The journey to that redemption is the road of self discovery some of the characters take. 7/10 will pose for the canadian coast guard daily."
Finestkind (2023),Such a good movie,Saw Tommy Lee and wanted to watch this and so glad I did. Slow start but picks up as it goes along. I love the New England area and this was no different as the setting was beautiful ocean views in harbor towns. Two brothers with different fathers grow up in the same town years apart. The younger brother wants desperately to spend time with the older one and it all starts out great but trouble soon follows. This movie packs an emotional punch about what family means and the things they do to each other and for each other. It also shows us that our kids don't necessarily want to live the lives we want for them and we need to listen to what they are saying. Worth watching.
Finestkind (2023),"""FINESTKIND"" REVIEW","Directed and written by Brian Helgeland. A runtime of two hours and six minutes. Streaming on Paramount+ with an R rating. ""Tom"" played by Ben Foster is a fisherman off the Massachusetts coast. He follows in his father ""Eldridge"" played by Tommy Lee Jones's footsteps. After ""Tom"" step brother ""Charlie"" played by Toby Wallace comes to work with him for the summer a string of horrible events take place. With one horrible event after the next, you would think ""Charlie"" would be discouraged. On top of his father ""Gary"" played by Tim Daly urging him not to. But he's even more enthralled by the idea of being like his older brother and becoming a fisherman. ""Charlie"" falls in love with the local drug dealer ""Mabel"" played by Jenna Ortega. He gets close with his brother's crew. ""Costa"" played by Ismael Cruz Cordova, ""Skeemo"" played by Aaron Stanford, and ""Nunes"" played by Scotty Tovar. Will ""Charlie"" throw his promising potential career of being a lawyer aside to reconnect with his brother ""Tom""? Will the endless issues of this summer be worth it in the end? Find out in this fisherman thriller. ""Finestkind"" wasn't what I imagined it to be. I saw Jenna Ortega in it. My daughter and I are huge fans of hers. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of her better films. This was a mixture of the films ""Contraband"", which also starred Ben Foster, and ""Perfect Storm"". Which starred Ben Foster co-star in ""Contraband"", Mark Wahlberg. This film was boring and kind of stupid for the better half of it. It was obvious ""Charlie"" was the issue. None of these problems arose until he showed up. Let's be clear you're going to give up going to Boston Law and have a promising future to be a fisherman. Don't get me wrong fishermen make decent money but nothing near what he would make being a lawyer. His brother seems to not have much and he's the captain. Your girlfriend doesn't seem to have it all upstairs if you know what I mean and she's a drug dealer. Following in her mother's footsteps. He should be running in the opposite direction not trying to lay a foundation down. For ""Charlie"" to be so smart he sure is dumb. A lot of the acting wasn't the greatest. You could tell apart the seasoned actors from the novice ones. The tale end of the film got a little more interesting but it still was predictable. This was a streaming film you could pass on. These actors have given you other material that would serve you better than watching this. This also goes back to me saying not everyone can write and direct a film. Sometimes, a lot of time they're the only ones who can see or understand their vision. Sadly another film my daughter and I did not enjoy watching. I give this film two mor fires 🔥🔥. #CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Finestkind (2023),Enjoyable but preposterous film about love of the sea and love for sons,"Who would be so ridiculous as to commit a serious crime to pay a fine for a serious crime? Fishermen, it seems. The point here, though, is to show the romantic pull of a life of fishing and, perhaps more importantly, the inexhaustible love of a father for his son. Despite the critics, the dialogue and the acting was fine, especially by Clayne Crawford as the chief bad guy and Tommy Lee Jones as an old fisherman. It's got the Taylor Sheridan touch, too. Not a great film, but the scenes of the New Bedford harbor and the handling of a catch of scallops added to a story replete with plot holes and characters who should know better."
Finestkind (2023),Bad Lifetime movie...,"Poor script. Bad acting. Unrealistic scenarios. Clichéd. Cheap version of the Perfect Storm. I could go on and on... For the most part, the cast is a bunch of nobodies. Fittingly so, since the script is garbage. This story has been told dozens of times, and all others were better. Fake, grizzled fishermen are stranded at sea after their boat sinks (surprise). While waiting to be rescued, they are cracking jokes and having a ""grand ol' time"" in a lifeboat. When they return to town, do they run to the relieved arms of their worried families? No, they go to a bar and start drinking! Honestly, this is better suited for a Lifetime made-for-TV movie. Don't waste your time!"
Home Alone 3 (1997),Macaulay's Gone? That Makes This Movie Dull and Boring,"Home Alone 3 was a terrible movie. This movie is dull and boring, not much even happens. Without Macaulay Culkin, this film is lifeless and bland. If this had Macaulay Culkin in this, this would certainly be be a better movie. Usally the bedt part about a Home Alone movie is when the kid pranks the robber. This time, when the kid pranks the robbers it isnisn't even funny and it is dull and boring. The only reason this heap of trash is good is because the kid is cute. That's it. This is my least favorite Home Alone ever. If you ever want to watch all of the Home Alone movies, trust me don't unless you like to watch bad movie. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially fans of the first two Home Alones. In all, I give this movie a 2.5 out of 10."
Home Alone 3 (1997),Not the same kind of humor,"Some movies don't age well when you get to adulthood, but the first two movies still hold up for me as someone being 40+. But the humor in this movie is so vastly different. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief when watching the previous movies somewhat, and for me, that's OK. I wasn't expecting realism when watching this movie. But when you have anthropomorphic animals communicating as if they understand humans, then that's too much for me as an adult. I'm sure any 8 year old will love this movie though! What I also don't appreciate is the scope of the movie. The first two movies involved two seriously inept burglars. Here the 8 year old protagonist is dealing with a crime syndicate."
Home Alone 3 (1997),Not as good as the first two films,"Home Alone 3 is a 1997 (reboot you could say) comedy starring Alex D Linz,Scarlett Johanson, Kevin Kliner and Seth Smith. The story follows a 8 year old boy named Alex(D Linz) who receives a present for Christmas in the form of a toy car with a remote control. Little does he know however the toy car has a special chip that 3 thieves named Alice(Rya Khilsedt),Petr (Alekander Krupa)and Burton(Lenny Von Dohlan) are after. Now it's up to this michevious boy to take down the bad guys once and for all. Overall this was an OK follow up. Not as good as the first two films since Maculay refused to do anymore sequels for this film."
Home Alone 3 (1997),"Great film, first two hard to follow","Fun
Good premise
Good baddies
Lovable smart kids. Lots of fun, my son loves it. And we do too. Good premise and storyline. Believable and far fetchef all at the same time! Good baddies, in the sense you're happy to see their demise..silly but kid still feels under threat. Kid is super lovable, and smart just like Kevin but still different enough. Naturally his sibling are not and help! Give it a go and get over the fact it's not Kevin and the original characters. It was hard to follow the best Christmas movie of all time. But this is definitely a great family watch in it's own right. Give it a go!"
Home Alone 3 (1997),movie underrated,"Then this is the third chapter of the home alone saga and someone will think Why didn't you review the first two Beppe that I didn't want to But I'll explain some things So home alone film released in 1990 directed by Chris Columbu Well there's no you don't even need dances What is Ifyou are not beings from another planet a great Christmas classic then in 1991 Or was it 92 home alone 2 came out which every person always said was more beautiful than the first but desolate for me it's not like that because for me it was the worst of the Saga But no because it was the version of the first one thoughset in New York it's only because in the second one there were too many stupid genk and they weren't funny characters Thrown at random and then the owner of the hotel played by the same actor who played it in 90 was really an unpleasant character and then the two thieves Mark is Harry in the first onefilms always hindered Kevin and then destroyed every house they entered but in this second film they don't learn anything about being thieves In fact they are knocked out by a punch from a woman and then Kevin was saved the second time But the production wanted to have a third film Mathe problem is that the actor who played Kevin abandoned his acting career because he was disappointed after the flop he had after his last two films, he decided to give up and therefore in 1997 Home Alone 3 was released after the actor's abandonment they had to change everything he had to dofor example this third chapter follows another story for example it no longer continues Kevin In fact one child is another So the beginning talked about it not being like the first two or there is no family that needs to be prepared for the flight Bob that is, four thieves carry out operations in Hong Kong fortake a chip to avoid getting caught they put it inside a toy machine But by mistake they got the wrong envelope and they follow the woman who has that envelope and so they leave for Chicago now at this moment we know the new programmer or Alex But unlike Kevin he is honest tohouse because he missed the plane because he got measles and so the four thieves go to alex's house to get food So what do I think about this film it is a solid act film that was not appreciated by the public or even by the critics barely even received a reviewpositive from critic nostalgia is TheLittleSongbird But in my opinion Because the title said it is an underrated film because I find it more beautiful than the previous two Yes even all the things didn't make any sense to me these things make sense then I know that this film seems like a copy offirst But you showed off that for me the second that they had something different was However similar to the first and then the saga has always been like this I say the things I like Alex for me a main character is much better than Kevin But that doesn't mean that I hate it it's only because thecharacter always did the same things or was always saved in the end by someone then in the first he was saved by a snowplow and in the second a lady who fed the birds instead alex vi He had to sort out the four thieves all by himself but now let's talk about them for a momentfour thieves Unlike the two of the previous films, they are not the rays who want to defraud a house but to take the chip which is truly a very powerful soul and these data are much more prosonal Asturias instead of the competent solids of the second film for me this film it's not at allas bad as others say But I hope that this film is at least appreciated by other people but obviously not the same as my opinion but less to be accepted and I advise you to see it this film for me is really one of the most beautiful favorite films for me to conclude I vote 10."
Home Alone 3 (1997),Could have been a fair bit worse but could have been a fair bit better,"This movie was entertaining and funny but there were quite a few things wrong with it. The main kid character should have been blonde. He should have been called ""Kevin"" not ""Alex"" The bad guys should have been called ""Harry"" and ""Marv"" and should have looked like they did in the previous two movies - Harry or Marv having acquired a girlfriend would have been good. They could have had the parrot initially aligned with the thieves but become an ally of Alex after he became trapped and freed by Alex - that would have been nice. Better than Home alone 2 and HEAPS better than Home alone 4 but could have been better than it was."
Home Alone 3 (1997),Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"Rat is named Doris, what else could you want? This movie is the cream of the crop for the Home Alone franchise. Macaulay Culkin could never show the acting depth of the kid who played Alex. The Wet Bandits aka the Sticky Bandits have nothing on the Russian spies present in this movie. This movie is absolutely perfection, and it truly needs to be a case study because it should be illegal for the third movie to slap this hard. Film students in the future will be trying to replicate the genius of this movie and failing miserably because no one can live up to the reputation of this famous movie. May it live on it our hearts forever. <3."

Whether you're a fan of the original films or new to the series, ""Home Alone 3"" is sure to bring joy and laughter to your movie-watching experience."
Home Alone 3 (1997),Bad but I've seen worse,"I don't like this movie but I don't hate it either. I have fond memories from watching it on VHS as a child and I decided to rewatch it this Christmas. I can honestly say I laughed more than I thought I would. Some of the jokes actually landed and the traps was pretty creative. As for the kid who set them.. They portrayed him as a kid genius with an IQ of 250 and I didn't really buy it. I didn't believe he was as clever and cunning as the creators wanted me to believe. And the villains overplayed their roles.. Honestly it was painful to watch most of the time. Yes, the characters from the original movies was always over the top but still within reason... And they had charm.. Something this one was sorely lacking. Despite all this I don't hate this movie, I would place it somewhere between mediocre and bad. I have seen lots of horrible movies in my life and I actually find this one tolerable."
Home Alone 3 (1997),"Underrated, My Favourite Of The Home Alone Movies.","Yes.. yes I know, it isn't as classic as the first Home Alone. Yes there's no Macaulay Culkin. The first movie has a nostalgic warmth and comfort, the same as a familiar bed or blanket or room. But for me, I watched this one the most as a kid and there for the nostalgia is strong. But even now as an adult, I enjoy this film. The plot is the best of the three (we don't talk about what came after three). I find Home Alone 2's plot just way too unbelievable and even though there are plot elements in three that are far fetched I just find it more watchable now as an adult. The booby traps are also far more funnier in my opinion and I like the idea of him trying to capture the crooks on film using his R. C car, however daft that may be. Plus Alex. D. Linz does a fine job."
The Godfather (1972),PART 1 & PART 2 ARE THE GOATS!,"I've watched this mutlple times a year since we've been able to pull up our favorite movies. Now as a screenwriter and currently working on my first film The Godfather has been one of the films that has taking my storytelling to another level. It has all the components to a perfect screenplay. Watching old interviews and blogs on the making of the films really made it more interesting to watch. Breaking down why wouldn't they wouldn't want Al Pacino and other actors for their roles. The battle with Marlon Brando. The real connection to the mob. Not to mention the constant battle with the studio. Francis quitting multiple times, etc. All that was needed to cook up up this classic."

The Godfather (1972),Cinematic masterpiece,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of time and genre, cementing its place as an iconic pillar of storytelling in cinema history. Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus weaves a gripping narrative that delves into the heart of power, loyalty, and the complexities of the human condition. Set in the dark underbelly of organized crime in post-World War II America, the film unfolds the saga of the Corleone family with an unparalleled blend of intensity and elegance.

Brando's gravitas brings an enigmatic depth to the character, making the audience empathize with a figure often seen as ruthless. Al Pacino's transformation from a reluctant outsider to a formidable force as Michael Corleone is a journey marked by emotional turmoil and a chilling metamorphosis.

The evolution of Michael Corleone remains one of cinema's most captivating character arcs, drawing viewers into his tumultuous psyche.

The film's legacy extends beyond its critical acclaim; it has become a cultural touchstone, quoted, referenced, and revered across generations. Its influence on filmmaking techniques, storytelling, and character development is undeniable, setting a standard that few movies have matched. In essence, ""The Godfather"" is not just a crime drama; it's a Shakespearean tragedy set against the backdrop of the American Dream.

For cinephiles and casual viewers alike, experiencing ""The Godfather"" is not just watching a film-it's immersing oneself in a timeless work of art."
The Godfather (1972),Best movie I've seen 👌,"Aptly the godfather of gangster shows and movies, the original 1972 release is still the best Godfather movie. The movie won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Marlon Brando.don't have too much to say about it, but GOD DAMN THAT MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! Going into it, my expectations were cautious because of how hyped it is. I know it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and with how long it is I expected at least a little bit of dragged out plot or slowness, but every single moment was riveting. This movie is absolutely the best I've ever seen in regards to knowing when and how to present the story. It reserves itself and only gets brutal/intense when necessary, and even the most simple and quiet of scenes have an immense sense of meaning to them. My heart pounded harder than it EVER has in a movie."

The Godfather (1972),An all-time classic!,"There are simply no words to express how great this film truly is! How can one still watch this film made in 1972 today? Very few films are able to achieve what the Godfather did, most aspiring actors look up to this movie as an inspiration and attempt to do what each actor was able to do in this film. The movie is simply timeless and a huge reason why Al Pacino became a huge star. It is almost impossible to find any shortcomings in the film as all the performances were extremely organic and rarely felt scripted. Last but certainly not the least, thank you to Marlon Brando, who did not just give us one of the most iconic movie posters of all-time but also hooked you to the screen whenever he came on and embodied the role of an aged mafia don with the utmost conviction. A masterpiece of cinema, this."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),Utter Tripe,"Proof positive if any were needed that sequels are generally pointless / useless. The movie is almost 3 hours and could have benefited from editing all 3 hours out aka not released at all. The dialogue and acting is wooden, yes, I get it that this movie is not supposed to make too much sense, but still having a semblance of a plot and a semblance of acting, direction, coherence, continuity would be a basic element of a movie. Overall, not at all sure what on earth prompted people to give a high rating of 7 odd for this title. As an earlier reviewer put it, 3 hours of the movie is like three hours of torture. Yeah!"
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),Clunky and lacking charm,"Hitherto I have enjoyed all the outings of John Wick. But this episode was disappointing. I am usually very drawn in to the story and the action, but I was frequently bored during this film. The fight scenes were not as snappy as they usually are in John Wick movies. Many of the foes appeared not to have particularly strong or indeed any fighting skills. They were just goons to be dispatched with no sense of peril to John, even with John appearing to have very stiff joints in this film. There were attempts to make us care about the various characters, but these fell flat, as in this film the characters were cartoonish sketches, rather than someone we could have any feelings about. Over and over again, scenes were just a lazy nod to earlier themes. For example, the procurement of battle clothes and weapons which in previous episodes has been entertaining, was on this occasion very dull and looked like a careless afterthought."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),45 minutes too long. 2:49 too bad.,"I am a huge fan of the Wick franchise. I knew what Chapter 4 was going to deliver (or not) since I no longer go to the cinema, but rather wait for movies to stream. As others have said before, the plot is thin and in the background. The fights are front and center, are too long, and get tedious. I had to split the movie over two nights to make it through...and this comes from a guy who will watch Chapters 1 thru 3 every time they're on tv. This was a sad struggle to sit through. The stellar cast was wasted in this sequel. I see many complaints about dancers in the nightclubs or cars around the Arch de Triumph not noticing the kills around them. Since Ch 1, I've assumed this is an alternate reality (like a video game) where assassins run amok around the NPCs, and that is how it is supposed to appear in this version of NYC or this version of Paris. They are not the same versions of these cities if we were to travel there on vacation, so I can get past that. The script for this movie could not have been more than 5 pages of dialogue. Besides the repeat of ""I need guns. Lots of guns."" and ""Yeah..."", there isn't much else. Winston gets off a one-liner now and then, but that's it. As a mega-fan, I cannot recommend that other mega-fans spend their 2 hours and 50 minutes on this steaming pile."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),His actionist yet,"After three films you might think that John wick has run out of ideas and everything gets a bit samey. Sure it can be like that but in a good way. This franchise really does have so much to give and this fourth chapter is no difference. From the get go there's an explosion and tow close lives threatened. Wick comes back and we see the series latest villain played by Bill skarsgard, who is very convincing as one. The fights scenes are great as always especially the French Vs Asians fight. Also wick getting bolted down the stairs has some almost comic relief. Overall with the cast and everything John wick is still one of the greatest action series in modern times."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),John Wick,"The cinematography was beautiful. However, no way it's that hard to camp one person... I think even I would be able to take down that man by cancer camping in a corner. The plot armour was insane and unrealistic but it wouldn't have stopped me. The franchise was deserving of an end and that is all this movie was, an end to the John Wick character. I will live life peacefully from now on knowing that I won't ever have to see a teaser for another John Wick movie. The first movie was good but all but certain movies shouldn't have sequels made and this was an excellent example. I made this account to hate review."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),"Shooting, shooting & shooting","If you want to waste 2,5 hours of your life watching a series of complete unrealistic shooting scenes with no plot, this is your chance. They had tons of posibilities, money, time and expectations to make this a great movie. Instead they give us nothing but shooting and a cheap plot. Like another reviewer said it; it's like playing a video game on «easy»-mode. Unrealistic scenes, effects and, again, useless plot. Some of the main charaters seems hard to understand the necessity of and the hitmens (or whatever you call the guys that shows up out of nowhere with a gun) miss the target standing 2 meters away from John. I'd rather watch the first movie again a couple of times in stead of this rubbish. Please don't waste your precious time on this."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),"Keanu REEVES versus Marko ZAROR, Scott ADKINS et alii","WOW! Mega-cool fight scenes (no wonder when Marko ZAROR and Scott ADKINS are part of the cast), magnificent sets (gorgeous: the cherry blossoms and the Shogun Museum in Osaka), beautiful shots (the fight scenes from above: great!) and then that Ride in the humming roundabout at the Triumphal Arch followed by a climb up the stairs to the Sacre-Coeur! Chad STAHELSKI knows exactly what he wants. And he delivers mercilessly! But STUDIO BABELSBERG takes the cake with the magnificent backdrop of the Berlin club HIMMEL UND HÖLLE. Just big! Plus Scott ADKINS with the performance (and mask) of his life! You have to see how the dancers in the club integrate the beating, shooting and murdering killers into their own performances (better yet: ignore them)! It is breathtaking how STUDIO BABELSBERG has developed since the mega success of THE PIANIST (Golden Palm, several OSCARs). I definitely won't be able to forget this set. The story? Well, as usual. Completely different things matter here. A discovery for me is Shamier ANDERSON with his cuddly dog. I'm glad I saw this battle record on the big screen!"
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),Dishonorable ending. John Deserved better.,We saw John battle for his life every single film. Clinging to a memory of his wife...kept him strong which allowed him endure the toughest moments of his life. The man wanted to get out...His decisions led him to every boss he was against. The world was against him..In the end. He earned the honor because he survived. But that's just not what we saw did we? We saw his closest friend walk away and watch him bleed out..What a dishonorable act a friend portrayed. John wick deserved a better ending. It wasn't poetic one bit with what happened. Cowardly to say the least. This in my opinion ruined my perspective I had towards the movie's creators.
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),yawn wick: no more,"The first film is iconic, the second one isn't bad. The third is an absolute chore but I believed the fourth would be a return to form as every actor, musician and everything in between can make a mistake. You'll get just as much mental stimulation out of watching some pro gamer streaming some really violent third person shooter you're too cheap to buy. I'd wholeheartedly give this extremely lazy and predictable movie a 2.5 out of 10. There is WAY too much fighting and shooting in this. Rambo 2 and other blood bath like movies at least it's a build up to it. Instead it's almost right away and it never stops to the point you're borderline exhausted. The only people who would enjoy this start to finish would be a kid with ADD who gets easily bored that should seriously see a school councillor. Is everything ok at home Billy? Why the first one worked so well was John was vulnerable, we didn't understand how terrifying he could be and as the film progresses we realize why he is a legend... in the first one someone knocked him out even! John gets thrown down a few flights of stairs and shot a few times in this but seriously it's just like some video game, Beat up or kill a bunch of low level henchman without taking any form of break and then fight a boss. Rinse and repeat the only thing new they tried which is the only thing memorable was the top down scene with the.incendiary (flame) ammunition where it's essentially a top down shooter like GTA 2 or even Smash TV on nintendo, among others. I feel all of this could have been accomplished in the third movie as this movie is like a cool uncle or other family member you had over for the holidays who has over stayed their welcome. You've heard all their best stories of the year, their best jokes and so forth and they won't leave you alone. The movie is ridiculously long, to the point they might as well have done 2 parts and put them out 6 months apart assuming there was a cliffhanger or a bit plot included or possibly done some serious cuts where some of these scenes should have been on a directors cut blue ray or something. There are great 2+ hour movies but this isn't one of them. I hope there was intermissions or something like some crappy Bollywood movie that's 3+ hours long. Some scenes that were a chore to watch were the scene near the Arc De Triomphe, it's just a bunch of people getting hit by cars. The stairs scene where John was flung down a bunch of stairs too was almost insultingly stupid and an extremely over done cliche ohh if he's late! OF COURSE the Eiffel tower had to be mentioned so people bored enough to finish this can ""verify"" this movie was shot in Paris. I don't even think if the bounty was 100 million or so they wouldn't have gotten him. Another that was stupid was the fat guy who kept running away in a night club and no one was sober or paid enough attention to realize what was going on. Why this isn't rated lower is I guess the casting minus the main bad guy are done quite well. No more short haired ""bad women"" , there was a good shot or two of action scenes but Keanu is showing his age as he seems a bit more stiff and at least the plot was established 2 or 3 movies ago. There was the odd second or two of interest with the stylistic shots using color correction, some set pieces had some good lighting and the use of LED lights in the clubs and other areas as well but either way this movie is a waste of time and it's so bad it even has a funeral for itself at the end of it. I hope this is the last one before it turns into fast and the furious or so. It would be impossible for me to watch even a fraction of this movie again. I say it a lot but I've enjoyed direct to video Steven Seagal movies more, I've enjoyed The Room (2003) more and I've enjoyed just about anything from No Holds Barred (Hulk Hogan) to Cobra (Sylvester Stallone) and Miami Connection (Y K Kim) more."
John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023),Shooting in a NPC world,"The review of siderite is spot on. No plot, no storyline, slow or pointless dialogues. But what irked me the most in the 2.5 hours of the same shooting scenes is that apparently the whole world was filled with NPCs. Imagine going into a club, knifing, shooting or axing 50 people on the dance floor... Yet everybody keeps dancing. Or shooting 50 assassins and destroying 20 cars or the roundabout of the Arc de Triomphe... Yet no police shows up and everybody keeps driving as if there is nothing wrong. That roundabout has troubles digesting normal traffic that don't need to worry about dodging cars, bullets and brain from all of the head-shots. I didn't think the third sequel to the (brilliant) first movie would be worse that the other sequels but the last 2.5 hours of my life proved me wrong."
Bad Santa (2003),"Not Clever, Not Funny, Just Complete Garbage.",At a rating of 7.2 I expected it to be good but it is at totally the opposite end of the spectrum. It has clearly been voted highly by people who are impressed by swearing alone rather than any form of quality. With the use of the F word almost 180 times in the film and Sh** approaching 90 times in a 90 minute film - there is are two Fs and one S every minute ! I was ready to turn it off after the fist 15 minutes but thought it would get better because of the 7.2 rating but it never did - only worse. I am trying to think of something positive to say but I genuinely cant. It was just extremely bad in all ways.
Bad Santa (2003),My favorite Christmas movie,"While other people watch Love, Actually or Home Alone, I watch this movie every year at Christmas. It is very funny and Billy Bob Thornton is my perfect Santa Claus. I bet he's saying what many department store Santas are thinking but cannot say! But there is good in this movie, his relationship with the kid is beautiful and what he does for him is much more important than having him sitting on his lap for one minute to promise to bring an expensive gift. This is the real Christmas of all the people who do not have a perfect Hollywood Christmas life. Too bad they didn't stop here and made a sequel that is absolutely horrible, but not knowing when to stop seems to be quite usual at Hollywood. But if you're bored of the sugary perfection of the usual Christmas movies, Bad Santa is here for you."
Bad Santa (2003),20 Years & Still A Hilarious Classic!,"Remember seeing this classic years back when I was a young teen & have always watched religiously since then! The film sees Willie Stokes, a miserable conman & his partner who pose as Santa & his Little Helper to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. But they run into problems when the conman befriends a troubled kid! I found the film to be pretty ace! For 91 minutes you're treated to non stop hilarity as well as some well acted drama scenes! It's funny as it gets with this flick & the scenes & scenarios are not only memorable but quotable too! Billy Bob Thorton plays the role of Willie really well & knocks it out of the park! The supporting roles are good too! 20 years on & this film is still a classic & a film me & the family watch every Christmas Eve! There's plenty of laughs, hilarity, eye candy, drama & seriousness mixed into this 1 hour 31 minute yuletide treat of a flick! Overall, you'll enjoy this one! It's an ace Christmas Comedy Flick that's so fast paced, you'll want it to continue it's that ace! 9/10."
Bad Santa (2003),"Bad Santa, Great Movie","Willie T. Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) is a raging alcoholic, who at Christmas, poses as a department store Santa Claus, while his dwarf partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), poses as an elf. When off duty, they case the department store they work at and rob it on Christmas Eve every year. When they're hired at the anchor store Chamberlain's at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, Arizona, Willie befriends a chubby, lonely boy named Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) and a barmaid with Santa issues named Sue (Lauren Graham). But Willie and Marcus encounter an obstacle: mall security guard Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac), who muscles in on their action. Bad Santa is a truly brilliant black Christmas movie from start to finish. The acting is terrific. Billy Bob Thornton is incredibly good as Willie. Tony Cox is hilarious as Marcus. And Brett Kelly is tremendous as Thurman. Heck, everybody does great with their roles. The writing is top-notch, too! I'm one of those people who loves vulgar humor. And from start to finish, Bad Santa is loaded with vulgar comedy and sexual situations. That includes Willie and Marcus's heated debates, Willie making out with Sue, Willie constantly yelling at Thurman when Thurman asks him stupid questions, and Willie trying to teach Thurman how to stand up for himself in the face of bullies. The dialogue is top-notch, especially from Marcus. All the characters are also well-rounded and unforgettable. And let's not forget the music. David Kitay's score for this movie is energetic and pleasant to listen to, and sounds suspenseful when needed. The movie also makes it a point to include classical music, which works fabulously. All in all, Bad Santa is a hilarious and delightful black Christmas movie. If you don't like raunchy or demented comedy, then this movie isn't for you. Otherwise, get a taste of it! You won't be disappointed. And if you do, I recommend the theatrical cut, because it's the best."
Bad Santa (2003),He doesn't care if you're naughty or nice.,"It's fair to say that this black comedy isn't for everyone, but if you're into this sort of thing, this is a very funny film. It almost feels like a parody of traditional Christmas film as it's essentially everything you wouldn't expect in one. There are so many swear words thrown around it gets tiresome and annoying by the end, although in fairness this is the nature of Billy Bob Thornton's character. The acting is really good and Thornton plays a very convincing role as the miserable alcoholic Santa. Tony Cox is very funny in this film. The film's humour is generally not that sophisticated but it doesn't need to be. There are so many jokes in here, all delivered quickly, and many of them land and won't really date themselves. The ones that fall flat are the same ones that fell flat back then. It's hardly a heartwarming tale but it's one that's an entertaining watch."
Bad Santa (2003),Not for General Audiences,"This film essentially begins with a former convict by the name of ""Willie"" (Billy Bob Thornton) donning a Santa costume and working in a shopping mall right before Christmas. Also working with him is a named ""Marcus"" (Tony Cox) who poses as an elf and escorts all of the children to him. Yet unknown to anyone in the mall is the fact that both Marcus and his girlfriend ""Lois"" (Lauren Tom) have conducted a thorough inventory of the mall and know all of the security features, along with where the safe is located as well. That said, on Christmas Eve they subsequently rob the store of everything of value and drive off into the night freed of any concerns for another year--when they do it all over again. Yet as the days go by it soon becomes apparent that Willie has developed an extremely bad drinking problem which, along with his generally disagreeable personality, makes thing more and more difficult for Marcus to contend with. So much so that, having already staked out a new mall for their next theft, Willie's questionable behavior arouses the attention of the mall manager ""Bob Chipseka"" (John Ritter) who subsequently asks the man in charge of security named ""Gin"" (Bernie Mac) to check him out. Meanwhile, as Willie descends deeper and deeper into an alcoholic stupor, he meets a young kid named ""Thurman Merman"" (Brett Kelly) who has his own set of problems--and that's when things really begin to unravel. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was one of those films that caught me totally off guard as I had expected a typical Christmas comedy suitable for the general public. I guess I should have checked it out a bit more beforehand. In any event, for those who haven't seen this movie, let me just say that this film includes non-stop profanity from start-to-finish along with several scenes of a sexual nature. So, it's definitely not suitable for a family night out. Yet having said that, it was still a fairly entertaining film all the same due in large part to good performances by both Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox. Admittedly, like a joke that is told once too often, the profanity got a bit old after the first 30 minutes and caused me to lose interest to a certain extent--as I have never been one to associate crudity as being synonymous to good humor. The thing to understand, however, is that the profanity is the entire point of this movie. That said, while I certainly don't recommend this film to all viewers, it still has some entertainment value, and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
Bad Santa (2003),A Jolly Jaunt into 'BAD SANTA's' Unhinged Festivities,"""BAD SANTA"" stands out like a tipsy uncle at a family gathering - you're not sure if you should be amused or concerned, but you can't look away. Directed by the audacious Terry Zwigoff, this film offers a Santa Claus so far removed from the jolly old elf of yore that one might wonder if the North Pole had a rebellious phase. Billy Bob Thornton, in a role that can only be described as ""Santa after a decade-long Vegas bender,"" delivers a performance that's equal parts shocking and side-splitting. Tony Cox, as his pint-sized partner in crime, proves that mischief truly knows no size. As the world's most esteemed film critic, I must declare that ""BAD SANTA"" is the uproarious answer to the age-old question: What happens when Saint Nick gets a taste of the naughty list? It's a festive frolic that reminds us all that even during the holidays, it's okay to be a little bad."
Bad Santa (2003),Thurman Merman -Enough said,"Bad Santa is not your average Christmas movie in any way, shape, or form. But it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. The story is, two thieves plot to rob a mall on Christmas Eve playing a Santa and Elf. Let the fun begin. Billy Bob Thornton as the safe cracking, Alcoholic Willie is one of the best comedy performances he's given. This film also has a hilarious performance by the late, great, John Ritter in his last live action film role. I watch this movie every Christmas, and have for the past 10 years. You will love this film as long as dirty humor isn't a problem for you."
Bad Santa (2003),Best Christmas movie in 2003,"Hot dog! A new favorite xmas movie. Finally, a movie to topple A Christmas Story from its position as top xmas dog in my book. Which leaves Elf to round the three best. A mall Santa who is only in it for the money he steals from the mall he works, along with his dwarfen ""side-elf"", is our anti-hero of legend proportions. This movie is hilariously amaze. The bad Santa is bad indeed: irreverent as hell, poking fat chicks up the pooper in the dressing rooms, pissing his-self on the regular, and never, I mean NEVER without a liquor to hand. What's not to love? Honestly the funniest movie I've watched for ages. I usually find it so hard to find a good film and watch the whole thing without getting bored, and this film really got me laughing the whole time. 100% recommend !!"
Bad Santa (2003),Instant classic,"I said over and over and over again this movie's going to be a classic. I said over and over and over again this movie's going to be a classic. Ahoom, ahoom, ahoom, ahoom. This is sort of like Groundhog Day. Every single time it's on, so far, I can't help myself from watching. What an awesome movie! It was perfect. In my opinion. It's a dark side of Santa. It's on the scale and level of Pretty Woman. Can't help watching every time I see it on a channel. Good feelings. Great cast. Perfect cast. Everything just works out in movies like these. Fits all together like a perfectly pieced puzzle. A+"
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Hilariously great,"(9.5 but rounding up) The comedy The Wolf of Wall Street is a hilarious movie that has me laughing every second. Jordan Belfort, protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a young stock broker in wall street. As he starts working and making a name for himself and learning the in and outs of the stock market he meets Donnie Azzoff, best friend played by Jonah Hill, and together they start their own Stock broking business. I was surprised about how funny this movie would be. Originally I believed it would be mostly informing and explaining a lot about the stock market but it really showed that their is not that much to know. It showed many behind the scenes moments regarding the stock market and the luck behind it. Overall one of the best movies I've ever seen with great actors and comedy."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Entertaining but exorts the audience to almost admire Wall Street banksters?,"The Wolf of Wall Street is an entertaining and amusing enough film. It has plenty of crude scenes which are designed to shock and amuse, which is fine though ultimately becomes rather predictable. Given that the film is loosely based on the real Jordan Belfort's memoirs it puzzles me that the director would have used Belfort's memoirs to create a film that basically sends the message that ""greed is good"" to the audience. This isn't a film that gives the audience any lessons to be learned as a result of the pursuit of short-term profits which are based on a machismo-style lying and swindling. This is simply a film that tells an amoral story all the way through. There is no central message, apart from the message that it's fun to swindle the general public through dodgy insider trading and exploiting legal loopholes to accrue massive amounts of wealth and status. While 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is an entertaining film for those who don't want to think about what they are watching. For those who are actually aware of the enduring effects of the 2008 banking crisis, it is ultimately depressing to see a film that has no moral message and falsely elevates sociopathic characters like Belfort into a kind of tragic hero who serves as a kind of twisted Nietzschean role-model to narcissistic people who only care about the pursuit of wealth and status."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),THE MOST ENTERTAINING BIOPICS I HAVE EVER SEEN,"This is probably the most entertaining biopics that I have ever seen. I can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio got robbed from this movie in the Oscars, because this was probably his best performance of all time. This movie gives us a point of view of A man who is money obsessed and also finding an illegal way to get that money it also gives us deeper inside of Jordan Belford's relationship with his wife, which I thought was the most entertaining part in the movie as well. Jonah Hills performance is probably his best performance of all time. If you don't count, the jumpstreet movies, and the direction of Martin Scorsese feels more modern and feels more alive and with heart, Margot Robbie is another performance stealer because of one ,her good looks and two her acting in this movie was so refreshing, And I don't know that much about the Wall Street business, but from the looks of it, it looks very dangerous, and feels untrustworthy to the point where you have to really pay close attention to what you say and to who you're talking to. The way that he tears his own life apart is so entertaining, not entertaining in a way that I don't feel bad for him, but in a way that the first second and third act felt like a roller coaster and the way he goes about his life overall, this was a stellar performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, and Margot Robbie and in my humble opinion, one of Martin Scorsese's best films 9/10."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Just a flat block of shouting leading to nothing,"I watched this film when it came out in 2013 but recently re-watched it and was surprised at how bad it is. I think at the time it had a shock appeal which it no longer has in 2023. Positives...the occasional funny moment...some interesting editing, e.g. The Popeye cartoon and the fairly accurate 80's grading on the infomercial sections...and its a big budget film so it has lavish sets... But apart from that it is an over compressed childish mess from start to finish-it has no space or nuance, the script is very repetitive, the story is extremely weak and overall the acting is nauseatingly overdone. It just shouts at you for 3 hours and expects you to be shocked by individual scenes of drugs and sex, from one unto the other until it reaches a very unsatisfactory and confusing outcome. If I was an actor looking back at all those the scenes of hollering and shouting in the office-70% of the film-I'd be embarrassed to have been part of them. There is no contrast in the film; not one likeable character, nor is there a character you hate, revile or envy, its just an irritating flat block that will actually steal something precious from you-3 hours of your life."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Shows true reality of how too much of anything is not good.,"It's one time watch movie alone cause lot of nudity scenes and the hero of movie is like GTA 5 mike character, he does all sorts of illegal things, not worth 3 hours if you play GTA 5 all the time. It's not something you don't want to watch if you are sensitive to obscene acts, watching with kids, your loved ones. Although movie is hilarious but you kind of get a feeling that 3 hours is way too long for a movie like this, the ultimate thing you learn from this is: Being able to sell anything can make you ton of money, good communication and persuasion skills are the need of the hour. Hope it helps."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Too bad there is not a 0/10 rating,"The worst movie I have ever seen by a bunch. I kept watching because I couldn't believe it could be that bad. There had to be some redeeming quality. Nope. Aside from the bad acting, the fake sets, the poor direction, the nonexistent plot....., the idiotic writing, the phony made up scenes, the pitiful dialogue, I still couldn't find a reason why it was made, or why it was released. Anybody associated with the production should be embarrassed to have their name in the credits. What could they have been thinking? I am wasting my time in writing this review because I can't believe most people would even bother to read a review after they watched two minutes of the movie."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),An Exhilarating and Unapologetic Dive into Excess,"""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, is a tour de force of cinematic storytelling, offering an unflinching and often humorous look at the excesses of the financial world. This film is a rollercoaster ride of ambition, greed, and debauchery, anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio's electrifying performance as Jordan Belfort, the infamous stockbroker whose rise and fall epitomizes the corrupting influence of power and money. DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of phenomenal. He fully embodies the character's charismatic, manic energy, and moral ambiguity, delivering a performance that is both captivating and disturbing. The way DiCaprio navigates through Belfort's highs and lows, from his intoxicating success to his inevitable downfall, is a testament to his range and skill as an actor. The supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's loyal yet equally flawed right-hand man. Hill's comedic timing and chemistry with DiCaprio add a dynamic layer to the film, providing both humor and depth to the narrative. Margot Robbie, as Naomi, is a revelation, bringing strength and complexity to a role that could easily have been overshadowed in a less capable actor's hands. Scorsese's direction is masterful, showcasing his signature style of fast-paced editing, dynamic camera work, and a keen eye for detail. He crafts a world that is both alluring and repulsive, drawing the audience into the seductive glamour of Belfort's lifestyle while never shying away from the darker, more destructive aspects of his actions. The script, written by Terence Winter, is sharp, witty, and engaging. It manages to weave humor and satire into a narrative that also speaks to larger issues of corporate greed and moral bankruptcy. The dialogue is fast-paced and crackles with energy, capturing the frenetic world of Wall Street in the 90s. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is also a technical marvel, with excellent cinematography, editing, and a soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's tone. The use of music, in particular, enhances the film's immersive experience, capturing the spirit of the era and the excesses of Belfort's world. While the film's explicit content and moral ambiguity might not be to everyone's taste, it's precisely these elements that make ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" a bold and honest portrayal of Belfort's life. It doesn't glorify his actions but instead presents them in all their outrageousness, leaving the judgment to the audience. In summary, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an exhilarating, unapologetic depiction of greed and excess. It's a film that combines outstanding performances, expert direction, and a provocative script to create a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience. Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best, earning a well-deserved 9 out of 10."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),A Wild Ride of Excess and Consequences,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic tour de force that thrusts viewers into the unapologetic world of excess, greed, and unbridled hedonism. Martin Scorsese, along with Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance, delivers a bold and unflinching portrayal of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street tycoon whose insatiable appetite for wealth leads to both incredible highs and devastating lows. DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is nothing short of extraordinary. He embodies the charismatic and morally bankrupt character with a level of energy and intensity that is both captivating and repulsive. The actor's chemistry with Jonah Hill, who plays Belfort's eccentric business partner Donnie Azoff, is electric, providing some of the film's most memorable and outrageous moments. Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the excesses of the 1980s and 1990s with a frenetic pace and bold visual style. The film's editing, coupled with Thelma Schoonmaker's expertise, creates a relentless and immersive experience that mirrors the chaos of Belfort's life. The use of voiceover narration and breaking the fourth wall adds a unique layer of storytelling that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is undeniably entertaining, it doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity of its characters. The film serves as a scathing critique of the unchecked greed and moral decay within the financial world. It forces the audience to confront the consequences of unchecked ambition and the toll it takes on individuals and society. The supporting cast, including Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Matthew McConaughey, all deliver standout performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance. Robbie, in particular, brings depth to her character, providing a strong counterpoint to the male-dominated world of high finance. The film's three-hour runtime may seem daunting, but every minute is packed with energy, humor, and biting social commentary. It's a wild and unapologetic ride that leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection on the excesses of the era and the broader issues of morality and accountability. In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic spectacle that leaves an indelible mark. Scorsese's direction, coupled with DiCaprio's powerhouse performance, makes it a must-watch for anyone seeking a rollercoaster of emotions, from laughter to discomfort, in a brilliantly crafted narrative. Strap in and brace yourself for a journey into the dark heart of Wall Street."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),That scene with DiCaprio and Robbie was kinda weird.,"I read some of the reviews before writing my review, and I was pretty surprised at how everyone either loved or hated this movie, and if you hated it, you REALLY hated it. Belfort was a pretty interesting character, because he's supposed to come off as a super bad person, but I think that any good movie needs those kinds of people. Even after all he did, he didn't even suffer that much in the end. The movie was super long, and I honestly think it could've accomplished the same story in a much shorter time frame. I wasn't really bored while watching, but it could have been shortened. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes dark comedy and movies based on a true story."
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013),Unforgettable cinematic experience,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a wild rollercoaster ride through the excesses of Wall Street during the 1990s. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the film follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, a charismatic stockbroker with a penchant for hedonism and financial manipulation. The movie is a frenetic and darkly comedic exploration of greed, corruption, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance, capturing the charisma and moral decay of his character. The film's dynamic storytelling, energetic pace, and sharp wit make it an engaging and thought-provoking commentary on the allure and pitfalls of the American Dream. While some may find its explicit content challenging, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" stands out as a compelling and unforgettable cinematic experience."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Good ending but,"After seeing Saltburn (fantastic!) I was interested to see this director's first movie. The ending was great and really tied everything up nicely. However, I felt it was much too long and boring in getting there! Yes, this is a woman with a lot of anger and need for revenge. Why? I assumed she had been raped. It didn't come out until much later in the film that her best friend was the one who was raped and consequently committed suicide. What the director did was have the story of what happened come toward the end of the movie. It was like she told the story backwards. Consequently, I found most of the movie boring (why is this woman so angry and what is her deal?). I would not have finished watching it if I hadn't been so impressed by Saltburn. My thought was ""You are going to handcuff a grown man to a bed and do something to him that will ruin his life?"" ""Then you had better get some police grade handcuffs and not those silly S and M frilly things!"" Not too smart for someone who was supposedly in medical school! P. S. I am a woman in case you think I am a sexist man."
Promising Young Woman (2020),dead in one week,"Cassie Thomas (Carey Mulligan) is a troubled woman haunted by the past. She roams the bars pretending to be passed-out drunk. I wanted more from her 'moonlighting'. Quite frankly, I was disappointed with McLovin's reveal. She could be more creative and blackmail these men. She certainly is in danger of getting the crap beat out of her every time. She holds no leverage and no power. It makes little sense. I'm surprised that she's not dead after the first week. Even the stripper's revenge at the end is too tame and also a bit derivative. That's been done before and done better. Go for the balls if you want to shock me. Ryan's reveal is also expected so the video just doesn't have any shock value. All I thought about was the old phone that it came in and nothing else. This is an interesting premise but it needs to be smarter for it to really work. Right now, it has an interesting premise and Carey Mulligan and its style. In reality, she would dead in an alley somewhere."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Promising young filmmaker.,"Had it not been released at the end of 2020 when the pandemic threw our lives and livelihoods into disarray, PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN might have become the feminist landmark it deserved to be, like its maternal predecessor THELMA AND LOUISE. In order to make a profit 90% of movies slated for release that year were forced to rely on streaming services when Covid-19 forced the temporary closure of multiplexes. And because people all over the globe were now required to work out of their homes instead of showing up at the workplace, that meant they could no longer congregate at the water cooler. (For the benefit of millennials and Gen-Z'ers, the water cooler was nomenclature for where employees gathered during breaks to chat about non-work related matters.) Social media had taken communication to a state-of-the-art, but when it comes to sheer word-of-mouth, you still can't beat the ol' fashioned face to face conversation. In 2017, Ronan Farrow's expose on Harvey Weinstein in the New Yorker shed a spotlight on the mogul's decades long predatory behavior in Hollywood. Overnight, Farrow's article, which coincided with a corresponding account by the New York Times, opened up the floodgates where many actresses felt emboldened to share their personal stories about Weinstein's abusive personality. But it didn't end with him. Several prominent males in the public eye were similarly outed for their sexual harassment as women ~and a few men~ once too afraid to speak up were now given their day in the court of public opinion. Almost around the time Farrow opened the world's eyes to Weinstein's depravity, Emerald Fennell began working on a timely screenplay. Fennell's career started as an actress in supporting roles, but she had an equal passion for writing, starting with children's books before eventually landing the head writer's job on the TV series Killing Eve. With that talent and ambition, it was inevitable she would want to branch out as a director. Upon completing the script for PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN, Fennell was able to sell the outline with the proviso that she be allowed to direct. Cassandra Thomas (Carey Mulligan) is a pushing thirty medical school dropout who never recovered from the rape and suicide of her best friend and equally aspiring doctor Nina Fisher. Adding to that trauma was a lackluster university investigation into the assault and no criminal charges brought against the accused, despite the incident being witnessed by a group of drunken frat boys. Still living at home with Mom and Dad, by day Cassie works as a coffee shop barista, but at nights she's an avenging angel of sorts. Determined to teach sexual predators a lesson they'll never forget, Cassie isn't exactly Glenn Close boiling the rabbit, yet her calculated focus borders dangerously on sociopathy. Whether her attire is businesslike or plain Jane or just plainly provocative, Cassie always pretends to be so intoxicated she's on the verge of passing out. Without fail, some ""nice guy"" will gallantly help her to her feet, offer a lift home, but inevitably escort her to his place to take advantage of. As she lays on his bed in a supposedly semi-conscious state, he will attempt to remove her panties when Cassie very suddenly ~and very soberly~ asks him what he thinks he's doing. Needless to say, he's shocked into instant sobriety!! A lifeline into normalcy is unexpectedly thrown Cassie's way when a former classmate shows up unexpectedly at her place of employment for a cup of coffee. Recognizing her almost immediately, Ryan Cooper, now a pediatrician, casually reminisces about the old days and then mentions that Al Monroe, Nina's rapist, is back in town and due to get married. With all the bad memories flooding back to Cassie, she now alters her agenda to exact revenge not only on Nina's attacker but all of the people who enabled him. Her plans do not involve physical violence but rather to give them a taste of the psychological trauma Nina went through prior to ending her life. One of Cassie's first targets is Monroe's lawyer, whose aggressive tactics increased Nina's decline. But it's not just the men; there are women who are just as morally culpable. One such female is Madison, who, at the time, actually engaged in victim blaming. Reuniting with Cassie for lunch after several years apart, Madison is now married with children, but she shows no sign of regret over the past. Staying sober while getting Madison drunk ~possibly with the aid of a roofie~ Cassie bends the law as much as possible without breaking it by arranging for her ""friend"" to experience her own post-blackout anxiety. Another target is Elizabeth Walker (Connie Britton), a one-time college administrator but now serving as the dean. Blaming Walker for caring more about the accused's reputation than the victim ~which always when big money intervenes~ Cassie visits her office under the pretense of enrolling back in school before springing her trap. While Cassie is redressing her late friend, her love life is getting a makeover. Clearly smitten with her, Ryan wears down her defenses a date with her, showing her that all guys shouldn't be painted with the same brush. But her romantic rebound hits a speed bump when Ryan unexpectedly catches her on one of her nighttime crusades. Assuming that she's playing around, he dumps her, leaving her heartbroken and angry at herself for allowing to let things go this far. Pleading for another chance, Cassie succeeds in winning him back, the relationship progressing to the point where she invites him over for dinner with her parents. A startling revelation occurs towards the picture's final act, with the potential for serious ramifications if Cassie isn't careful. PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN is a triumph for both Carey Mulligan and Emerald Fennell. Mulligan delivers a superb performance as a damaged lady whose trauma over her friend left her with no faith in the legal system. Whether she's playing drunk ~which is apparently very difficult for an actor~ or abruptly switching to sobriety, she keeps the audience glued to the screen. We'd almost feel sorry for some of the guys if they weren't such creeps. By simply using her eyes to convey emotion ~or the occasional lack of it~ Mulligan can make us glad we're not in Cassie's crosshairs yet also evoke empathy over how red tape shatters the innocent and protects the guilty. Mulligan's acting secured her a well deserved Academy Award nomination....but no win! Frankly, I thought she was robbed!! The accolades for Fennell's directorial debut were very bountiful. Selecting Mulligan for the lead role was a masterstroke but, with the supporting parts, her intuition bordered on genius. To illustrate the deceptive nature of so-called nice guys Fennell hired male actors known more for their comedic timing than dramatic chops. By casting likeable personalities as unlikeable characters, it intensifies our surprise when these disarming charmers show their true colors. For one role, Fennell made a decision out of left field. Clancy Brown was noted for his portrayals of nasty individuals ~especially in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION~ but in PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN he's cast against type as Cassie's supportive father, a man not quite as high on the paternal barometer as Atticus Finch, but about equal with Juno's dad. Fennell was just as inspired with the ladies too. Alison Brie's credentials encompassed more into comedy than drama, and when she stumbled onto Fennell's script, she was absolutely determined to play Madison. Jennifer Coolidge and Molly Shannon were two other women who had comedic timing coursing through their blood, which is why it was unusual to see them as the mothers of, respectively, Cassie and Nina. Fennell's first time calling the shots made a few impressions on me. One is that Paris Hilton should restrict her singing to private outings only. 😆 Another is a particularly brilliant touch by Fennell where Cassie is walking in a near-trance after receiving a devastating bombshell. There is no dialogue spoken, only the voice of a little girl singing ""Once Upon A Time There Was A Pretty Fly"", a lullaby that signifies a child's loss of innocence. A true cinephile will recognize that tune from the Robert Mitchum classic THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, which Fennell shows a clip of on the television set of Cassie's parents. Emerald received Oscar nominations for both her direction and her original screenplay. Although she lost in lost in the former category, she took home the gold for the latter. With PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN Fennell created a feminist movie for the #MeToo generation that both genders really need to take a good,hard look at. Some might like the reflection that they see.🔚"
Promising Young Woman (2020),Not so promising.,"A major flaw of Promising Young Woman is the directors willingness to "" explain"" to the audience the points it's trying to make. That's for us to work out. Also I though parts were not realistic such as the ending. Also Flynn played by Bo Burnham was poor. The good- Carey Mulligan is fantastic and deserves her Oscar nomination. I also applaud the original take this film had. It wasn't afraid to be different and daring. There was perhaps some food for thought after seeing this. Some people have criticised the casting of Mulligan that she wasn't "" hot"" enough for this. Total rubbish. She's gorgeous and her performance was perhaps the redeeming feature. Look fast for. Clancy Brown who played a heavy in The Shawshank Redemption 25 years ago."
Promising Young Woman (2020),One of my favorite films of all time,"This is by far one of my favorite films of all time. Carey Mulligan delivers a knock out performance. Her Oscar nomination was so well deserved. The supporting cast was also fantastic. A stellar mix of comedy, thriller, drama and horror. Emerald Fennell is truly a wonderful new director. I just watched Saltburn and she continues to amaze me. Give this film a shot and you won't regret it! It will make you feel a whirlwind of emotions and it has an ending to die for. (No spoiler intended). I cannot wait to see if Fennell and Mulligan team up for a 3rd time! Surely that would be just as amazing. 10/10."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Nothing Less than an Understated Noir Masterpiece,"I don't even want to tell friends that I like this movie when I recommend it, as even that tiny bit is a spoiler of sorts. I wish that I could give my star rating as a spoiler as well. I write a lot of crime fiction and have tried to pull off noir, mostly failing. This nailed it. No one comes out of it in the end, and everyone is sort of dodgy and less than innocent. I think the people who didn't like this were expecting ""Saw: The Woke Version"" with the woman leaving piles of mutilated corpses in her wake. These represent the target audience for John Wick movies. I was surprised (and delighted) that it chose the understated route of Cassandra simply educating the creeps and spineless men and women who acquiesced to the ordeal that was the undoing of her friend. There are a few drop-dead brilliant moments in this film, which I thought dragged a little. I think shaving 15 minutes off the runtime would have done wonders to reel in on-the-fence viewers."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Deceptively excellent,"This is hard to review without spoiling, but watching it it's more than worth it. Ever been to high school in the USA and something fishy went on between boys and girls? Probably no big deal, probably someone just got drunker than they should. I mean, I was a teen once, I remember it (even if in real life I don't say it to my friends...) Now I'm 30 right, but I still remember what happened all those years ago. Everybody seems to have moved on, I wonder why... This movie explores brilliantly this kind of setup that it builds. Also, shocker, the main character is a girl, which is a HUGE perspective in facts occurred. This had me gripped after like 15 mins when a proper scene had proper time to develop I had to bring myself to address my proper attention to it. By the end it improperly managed to surprise me beyond my expectations in a positive way. Though like this one I wonder if tragically my expectations are so low I need this one thing in my live to actually reset my values. Very good movie with great performances all around."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Stellar revenge feature,"This incredible, Oscar nominated gem, is definitely one of the more unique and acclaimed pieces of the year - and for good reason. It is a raw, uncensored, sometimes satirical, yet incredibly important, film for the ages. Very Oscar worthy, for sure. The actors all do an incredible job, very career defining, subtle, emotional and funny. The script accompining is just incredible, very unique and very wild, and leaves you with some rather profound and important messages. The cinematography, cutting and editing is excellent, and very much adds to the tone of the film beautifully. Very beautifully put together. Overall, truly an incredible drama, that is ever recommended for any lover of film! Just be warned, though, that it deals with some rather gruesome, yet important, themes."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Promising Young Woman review - it delivers on its promises,"What do people think of when they hear ""rape-and-revenge film""? Is it Jennifer Hills in ""I Spit On Your Grave""? Or perhaps it's the New French Extremity with brutal movies like ""Irréversible""? Unfortunately, these sorts of films have tainted the genuinely intriguing wells of revenge cinema with the pollution of exploitation. But in her feature debut, the multi-hyphenate Emerald Fennell chops away the male-gaze salaciousness and spitting on graves of her predecessors to deliver an unexpectedly funny, dishearteningly relevant, breath-catchingly suspenseful shocker that uses thrilling entertainment to draw viewers into the sobering questions it raises about modern rape culture. A career-best Carey Mulligan carries the film as Cassie, a perhaps brilliant, perhaps sociopathic tricenarian and medical-school dropout haunted by the rape of her college friend Nina and the pervasive apathy from every party except her. As an adult, she works at a coffee shop by day, but moonlights as an actress of sorts: she goes to sleazy, sweaty clubs; pretends that she's too hammered to put one foot in front of the other; and, as a ""nice guy"" takes her to his place and inevitably takes advantage of her, reveals her sobriety to her horrified wannabe assaulter. But, when an old college acquaintance arrives and reveals Nina's rapist is getting married, Cassie commences a journey of revenge against everybody involved in suppressing or rejecting Nina's truth. Besides the stunning performances, the film's wallop comes mainly from its smart, incisive writing that more than justifies its occasional strains of credulity. Even its twist ending, polarizing for some, is absolutely brilliant. Cassie's death during the bachelor party is revealed, through a careful procession of ""scheduled messages,"" to be anything but an unfortunate turn of events; she has, more intentionally than initially believed, martyred herself to carry out her final phase of justice and bring long-overdue juridical retribution against Nina's rapist. It takes most writers decades to achieve this level of meticulosity, and, combined with the subdued direction, candy-coated wardrobe and set design, and literally ""Toxic"" score, reveals a filmmaking talent already fully cooked. Representing vigilante justice from the feminine perspective is bold enough, but to do so in such an intelligent and capable film is a revelatory experience. ""Promising Young Woman"" reveals not only that the phallocentric patriarchy is an ancien régime, but that it's one in need of a revolutionary overthrow, whether by a concerted feminist movement or by the subtle boundary shattering of a promising young woman like Cassie."
Promising Young Woman (2020),Loved this move and suspect....,"I suspect there were some very uncomfortable men watching this who either didn't review or quickly gave it a low one lol Cleaver, both comedy and drama -dramedy-dark and humorous, poignant. Carrie Mulligan was great as ever, taking on the character and seeming as different as she does for every role. This is a movie about both nice men and a-holes. It's enlightening about sex, culture, universities, cover-ups, and other a consistent patriarchal society that dominates amd represses women-however, in this upcoming age of #MeToo, it is the time for women to fight back and have a voice. This movie does that-WITH A TWIST. You'll love it. One of the best movies I've watched in a long time. Can't believe I hadn't heard of it earlier. Hmmm could this be due to promising young, male executives?? Regardless...Highly recommend."
Reptile (2023),Well made. Good Cop Thriller. Cast was stellar,"Yes, it's a slow burn but it keeps your interest. Without spoilers, Del Toro always wins. His acting is second to none. Even Timberlake sells it well, and the rest of top notch actors. Thrill factor , yes... not over the top. Cinematography, Acting, Script and editing , great. Good use of color to set tone. From this filmmaker's standpoint, Bravo on all those points. Good use of lighting. Location was great. If we break down the movie, it comes down to real police work. It's never pretty, on either side of the law. These actors are believable cops and the realtors are just the same. There's corruption abound."
Reptile (2023),"Good overall, the script meant would never be great though","So I felt like for most of the movie that is was like movie made for TV. The Directing is good IMO the movie keeps your attention even in the slower parts. The Acting is very good by all, standouts are Benicio & Justin as you would expect. The script is the biggest weakness. So there is enough intrigue I found, however its not a shocker type or a twisty turner, and as many have noted, and its faitly slow going, so the Director had to be on point to keep the viewers interest. All that is what holds it back IMO, and what makes it feel like an average sleuth flick suited for TV, there is nothing that really elevates it or makes it stand out story-wise."
Reptile (2023),Good some-kind-of-crime drama,"Firstly, the acting and direction to me appears to be excellent in this well-paced and pretty slick crime thriller. Benicio is terrific in almost everything that he's involved in. Also, Justin Timberlake and Alicia Silverstone have really good outings in their roles ... surprisingly good acting from them both. The biggest - and really only - issue that I have with the film is in the understanding of the crime that's being committed / investigated. There's real-estate and drugs involved but ... maybe it's just me ... but it's not exactly explained what's going on other than a quick one-liner. Some exposition would really have helped the slower members of the audience put the pieces together. Substantially lower mark because of that. 61/100."
Reptile (2023),Atmosphere and excellent performances,"Great acting, believable relationships, proper atmosphere and some thrilling aspects. A bit too long but that didn't bother me as I enjoyed spending time with our main characters and unravelling the mystery with them. A bit confusing in terms of time period to start with due to some video processing effects giving an interesting 90s feel, but mobiles and cars place us firmly in 2022. For me the story wasn't that original, but the insight into the personal and career workings of our main character give this a very fresh feel for me; especially the relationship with his wife. I can see how other people would get frustrated by the 2hr15 running time, but I was never bored. If anything the drama/tension was drawn out a little too long. Worth watching. High quality performances here."
Reptile (2023),Stick to your autotuned singing,Stop me if you've heard this one before - A singer tries to be an actor and no one involved stands up to say they have zero acting talent. Timberlake should stick his autotuned music career and stop destroying projects for actual actors with talent. Which is really a shame. The rest of the cast does their best and the story could have been entertaining. And as usual Del Torro is great. When he's on screen you can see what their movie could have been. But every time the talentless amateur enters a scene all the oxygen is pulled out of the room and the audience is pulled out of the story. As I said - that's a shame.
Reptile (2023),"A lot of buildup and suspense. Too much, in fact","The movie has good actors, good soundtrack, and an interesting story, but the build-up is far too slow for a movie of this duration. Before the movie was over it felt like four hours had passed. Same old story of slightly corrupt cop redemption ark, but he doesn't really feel that redeemable because he keeps doing shady stuff as a cop. You keep expecting something big to happen, but it never really does. Everything just naturally happen at the same slow pace, and it feels very anticlimactic. At some point you just get tired of watching the main characters droopy mug, and you end up not caring how the movie ends."
Reptile (2023),A good thriller,"I was surprised at the fairly low rating for this film and thought it was definitely worth at least 7.5. It isn't perfect, and perhaps the ending is a little too simplistic and sudden, with a number of connections between the police and the Grady family left unexplained, but the build up and acting in the first half were super, creating a genuine tension as to where the story was going. Del Toro in particular has great presence. A few reviews have referred to this as having shades of David Fincher, and you can see it in the cinematography and editing, especially in the initial scenes when they are investigating the murder. Definitely worth a watch."
Reptile (2023),Good Quality Thriller,"It's a bit slow in places and understanding the relationships and jobs of some of the other officers isn't made abundantly clear. But on the whole it's a decent thriller. The best parts of it are by far Benicio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone's performances, both great. Why doesn't Silverstone get more roles like this, I want to see more dramatic performances from her. Streaming original films always face the difficulty of just being released then almost immediately swamped by the next release, hopefully it won't get lost in the rapid fire release schedule of Netflix's next productions. A solid crime drama, well worth a watch."
Reptile (2023),Slow-burner like no other.,"My Rating : 7/10 Standout thriller with a well-paced storyline, 'Reptile' grips the viewer into a murder-mystery puzzle in the vein of 'True Detective' or 'Twin Peaks'. Slow, meticulous and skilfully directed, 'Reptile' has many twists and Lynchian undertones such as upright characters in double-dealing situations, dark suburbia and noir. Benicia del Toro gives off a moody yet moral detective vibe with a dark sense of humour. On the flip side, it is very slow so viewers who want a fast-paced thriller will perhaps not enjoy it, it can drag unfortunately. However, if you like small towns, mysteries, Polanski then 'Reptile' is your thing. Go seek it out. It's not only a slow-burner, it's a slow-but-confident crawler!"
Reptile (2023),Reptile review,"For those who are unfamiliar of this movie, Reptile is a story about a hardened New England detective (portrayed by Benicio del Toro), investigate a brutal murder, while uncover a conspiracy behind it. Having been an enthusiast of the murder mystery, I find this movie simultaneously exceeded my expectation while come up short. The biggest strength this movie has to offer is the ability to foster suspense, build tension in a well-crafted manner, and keep the viewers engaged and invested in the story and the mystery in it. This, in large part, is due to the extraordinarily charismatic performance from del Toro, who commands every second of screen time he was in. Even though I don't often give ""points"" to a movie solely because of the acting performances in it, del Toro absolutely elevates the material to a captivating level. However, that being said, the movie has its' problem as well. Despite the well-crafted mystery and tension. I do think the film is unfortunately burdened by its bloated plot. While I do admire the ambition behind the concept, I think the execution of this movie it resulted in a over convoluted narrative, and rushed pacing - particularly during the final act. Overall, I think Reptile has exceeded in its purpose to tell a suspenseful and haunting story. I find much to admire in Reptile, and my overall viewing experience was quite enjoyable. However, I do think that this movie is yet to achieve any greatness."
Fast X (2023),Please just stop!,"It is not like the previous movies have been amazing but this one was so bad that no one who was involved should have made money from it...not including my $3 rental cost. This was like a recipe made by someone who has never cooked and guesses at the ingredients and portions after sticking their finger to taste it. How about this for the next movie, we find out Hobbs is really the father of Little B? Nothing made sense about this movie. Frankly sick of how Mia is always involved but never her and Brian's kids which would have actually made sense to play with Little Brian when he was at her house. At least bring back Owen because he was more of a competent villain since you brought back Gisele but somehow left out Elle - was she not tough enough. Since you added Brie Larson, how about have Nick Fury show up with her Captain Marvel costume since doing stupid is the premise for this one and the plan for the next. Here is one even better, let's have Paul's brother join the cast and say Brian had to get his face changed since her was a UC and needs to protect his family. Here is another idea, Twinkie and Sean are now selling flying cars and have started...wait for it...space wars. Oh yeah, we have to not forget that Dom and his son will grow gills and swim underwater while waiting to get picked up by the sub that comes all the way from Antarctica. If looking for more idea, you know where to find me you sumabitch. I am knocking this movie down another star for the inconvenience of watching the forcing me to write this review."
Fast X (2023),Lighten Up,"Not really a ""fan"" of the Fast franchise, I just caught this one because it was on Peacock, and I was needing to recover from a nasty virus that involved lots of unpleasant smells, and a terrible headache. Of course it's ridiculous. Everyone (aside from the eternally earnest Vin Diesel) hams it up a treat, and contrary to what some of the grumpy reviews on here are saying, Mamoa nailed it as an unhinged nihilist veering on a pendulum between menacing and campy, bent on wreaking his vengeance upon anyone who had wronged him in the past. Spectacular (yes, ridiculous) set pieces, a decent plot with heart, and the usual twists and turns, there's a lot to like, and as I said, I'm not even a ""Fastie"". Not really sure what the 1/10 reviewerswere expecting, but my advice is to lighten up....."
Fast X (2023),Mamoa was AWFUL,"Mamoa's acting was beyond awful. It was excruciating 😖 to watch. Overacting. He was just pointless to the movie. He wants to be a and guy but act like the genie in Aladdin.. At this point Mamoa should retire after such awful less than mediocre acting. He was not funny enough to make anyone laugh but he was a total joke. He was not good enough to be a bad guy. They should paid the Rock tripple $ just to help salvage the movie from this awful casting of Mamoa. The storyline is so convoluted, I just don't get where the thought process was. The agency boss was another bad part of the movie. Mr wonderfuls daughter was the best new cast member of there is to be a pro in this movie."
Fast X (2023),Worst film of the year? Or decade?,"Series that manage to rise from the ashes and was turned to one of the best action franchises. After amazing Fast Five and pretty good Fast & Furious 6, Universal had, due to the tragic death of Paul Walker, a golden opportunity to retire the series with dignity. Of course they didn't do it and decided to ruin one of their most valuable IPs by milking it dry. And this brings us to Fast X - film so bad, I managed to watch for maybe 20 minutes and then had to turn it off to keep my sanity. I do not understand, after 8th and 9th entry, how anyone would willingly go to a cinema and pay money to see this. Don't buy tickets to watch garbage otherwise Hollywood will keep making more."
Fast X (2023),Typical car chase problems,"Far Fetched X, typically unbelievable scenes that could barely be replicated in real life scenarios. Entertainment value was still ok, Paul Walker would possibly roll in his grave, but the credible scenes were cool. Jason Momoa doing what he does best, be universally cool... Himself. Producers and directors after all this time, (especially in a franchise) need to understand cars and how they work. Gear changes, G-Force angles in corners, realizing that a car that lands nose first, isn't going to just keep driving and looking like it's just had a shunt in peak hour, are all things that writers, producers and directors need to take into consideration, even to highlight action!"
Fast X (2023),Ridiculous!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Nonsense scenes one after another, bad acting, everything bad you can think on a movie. The idea was a blockbuster but this was a sleepbuster because I was all the movie struggling to not fall asleep. This thing was a bad scramble of comedy and fantasy without any interest for persons with a decent IQ, made for low intelligence persons. What a mess of scenes of filming garbage! The persons responsible for making this movie should go to jail for life without possibility to get out. This was crime committed to my intelligence and to my personal time."
Fast X (2023),Vin Diesel has a formula and sticks to it,"I admit I stopped watching these movies way back when Tokyo Drift was the worst of the series. This one I watched just to see Jason Momoa play a bad guy. He's camp, he's funny. But otherwise these movies are just copy and paste. They legit had a great ending saying goodbye to Brian, that should have been it. Now there's a 10 year old kid climbing on the back of moving cars, a prison in Antartica, 2 parts and somehow Jordana Brewster is still getting the least amount of screen time? Ultimately it's an entertaining watch for a quiet post-Christmas day. I might even watch the second part in 2025. But stars have to be removed for the casting of Gal Gadot. Ditch her for someone who doesn't rejoice in g#noc^de."
Fast X (2023),Another Failed One,"Why I continue to watch these movies in the hope of seeing somthing that resembled the first few, I'll never know. This has to be the worst one yet, hands down. I'm not sure why there have been all these writers strikes. Movies of the last 10 years have had some serious issues, namely with plot, dialogue and character development. Writers should be happy they have a job at all if this is the quality of their work. The movie is beyond weak - the story that follows Tej, Ramsay and Roman is literally filler with no substance or impact to the main story line. The action sequences are alright, but still way over the top and way too often. But what kills me the most is the un originality. How many times do we need to see a bad guy with a vendetta in these films? How many times do we need to see a good guy die, then them feed us some BS about how they are alive? The sad thing is - I'll still watcg the next one. But for God sakes, hire some new people to put it together!!"
Fast X (2023),Not bad,"It could be better when it was a one film not for two parts. I think it is take from Avengers, because they want very strong villains, but it is film about cars... so isn't real to have a badly guys on top. So villains are good actors, but good guys... terrific. But it is the first film which I don't know how it's end. So not bad not good film. Thema was not bad, family was too tired so I don't know why not eliminate major, but on one shot... Constructively. We need to end these, but have to spectacular. Beginning was surprised, but a lot of studios recreate actors. Nice to see however. I count on more interesting ending of series."
Fast X (2023),How low can you go?!,"So, tonight i felt like watching something that was going to make me have a little chuckle.....and I decided a really good comedy would be the way to go. So, while scrolling through the channels a found this load of offal that I had heard such terrible things about and thought to myself ""Could they have made an action movie in the F&F franchise that is so bad that it makes me hide away in shame or gives me rib tickling laughter and is what they about this movie really true?"" Well the only way to find out is to allow my own eyeballs to be exposed to such garbage....... I can tell you that YES, IT IS THAT BAD! How this was even considered for production after a script read is beyond reason.... I mean how could someone read this script and think ""Absolutely, we need to make this"". The person responsible for this needs to be sanctioned, and possibly imprisoned for making something so embarrassing. It is going to be hilarious when they make yet another and it completely flops because nobody, even the loyalist fans of this franchise can be accepting that another one would be a good idea!"
Pulp Fiction (1994),The genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic whirlwind, a genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions, enthralling audiences with its bold narrative structure, razor-sharp dialogue, and kaleidoscope of eccentric characters.

The film's dialogue crackles with intensity and pop culture references, elevating mundane conversations to moments of riveting tension or dark comedy. Tarantino's ability to infuse seemingly trivial discussions with profound depth and humor is a testament to his mastery of language and storytelling. What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is its ensemble cast, each actor breathing life into their eccentric characters with unparalleled charisma. Travolta's revival as a leading man, Jackson's commanding presence, Thurman's enigmatic allure, and standout performances from a stellar supporting cast create an ensemble dynamic that keeps the film's momentum pulsating. The film's eclectic soundtrack, ranging from surf rock to soul, serves as an auditory backdrop that enhances the film's unique rhythm and atmosphere. Tarantino's use of music is not just complementary but integral to the film's identity, each song adding depth and texture to the scenes they accompany. At its core, ""Pulp Fiction"" is more than a crime film; it's a bold exploration of morality, chance, and the human condition.

Pulp Fiction (1994),Tarantino's biggest masterpiece,"Pulp Fiction is a modern masterpiece that doesn't gets old with the time, it's non linear storytelling combined with great cast, high-tier script and different characters each one with its story, creates a masterpiece. It's not a predictable movie and you always expecting something more of each scenes. First time I saw it, it blowed my head, I have never seen nothing like this before, a non linear storytelling that cautiously follows each little plot or story to create the main story of the movie, it's awesome how each story is perfect that intersect with others stories to finally create a complex narrative."
Pulp Fiction (1994),Didn't really get the whole plot but enjoyed it,"I was disturbed watching this film. I mean at first I had a hard time understanding the plot or what was happening and even now I feel like I still don't understand the film. Maybe it's just me or maybe it's because of the way it's structured but it was disconcerting. Like I felt the film didn't really have any real plot and maybe that's the whole point. Nonetheless, I liked the film and I found it quite enjoyable. Although I found it a bit slow in the beginning it got me interested and some scenes were really gripping especially the ones with Samuel l Jackson. I mean for me he carried the whole film and his performance was brilliant and so compelling and earned him a well deserved oscar nomination. I don't who won the oscar for supporting actor that year but he definetly should have won that year. Anyways I recommend it."
Pulp Fiction (1994),A masterpiece of this movie without a knowledge,"Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic films of all time. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, it was released in 1994 and has since become a cult classic. The movie centers on two hitmen, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and their misadventures. The film features an amazing cast, including Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and Harvey Keitel. The movie is filled with dark comedy, violence, and a unique nonlinear story structure. The dialogue is sharp and witty and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Overall, Pulp Fiction is a classic that anyone can enjoy. It is a must-see for any film enthusiast. It features great acting, a unique story structure, and an unforgettable soundtrack. Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's finest works and is highly recommended for any fan of cinema."
Pulp Fiction (1994),Interesting comedy to watch,"Very interesting comedy but also very serious acted scenes. Then there's the music: the songs which Tarantino selected for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. The different story lines demonstrated here they come together nicely , the elegantly used flashbacks now and again , the use of ""chapters"" - there is so much playful creativity at play here, I was really glued when I was watching it. It 's just a pure joy to watch. I was also like the way the choose the best characters. You must think it's a fiction."
Pulp Fiction (1994),My personal favorite movie,"I watched this movie forever ago, and have rewatched it many times, I love that the mystery of Marsellus Wallace's briefcase still causes controversy to this day 30 years later. The movie are very time typical, the scene Quintin Tarantino wrote for himself, that absolutely would not happen today. The thing I love about this movie is definitely that every little detail counts, the bump they drive over for example, or Mia's pilot that laid ground for the kill bill movies. And last but not least, what is in the briefcase? Personally I think it's the diamond stolen in the movie reservoir dogs (1992) since we now already have seen that some of Quintin's movies are happening in the same universe. Reservoir dogs came out 2 years so in principle it could have happened before pulp fiction?"
Pulp Fiction (1994),Pulp Fiction,"This film will never get old to me. I am a huge Tarantino fan. This is a wonderful film! The story is written flawlessly. It's centered around two ruthless hitmen, a washed out boxer, and a Los Angeles gangster. Something that someone brought to my attention that I did not think about- this film is centered around people and their choices. All the characters are a result of their own actions. That is the only way I can describe it. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson really bring the story together and make you really enjoy the film even more. I would recommend this if you enjoy a good crime film."
Pulp Fiction (1994),A nice morning in a cafe to meet the troubles.,"Just as the adrenaline shot revived Uma Thurman in that film, this movie brought to life and added something new to the films of the early nineties. The story, dialogues, actors, music-all of it together shook Hollywood's cinematic slumber of that time. Yes, there were other films with a new perspective and unconventional stories, such as Soderbergh's ""Videotape,"" but Quentin Tarantino showed us what he wants to see in the future of cinema. Namely, stories of people who are like our neighbors, discussing the same things we do while driving in a car, not cardboard characters. Risk, passion, and the anger of a new era are what we see in this film."
Leave the World Behind (2023),Ambitious but flawed Netflixer,"The best and worst of Netflix is filmmakers can develop a story where length is embraced- the saying 'Kill Your Darlings' doesn't register with them; if they want a redundant love sub plot that slows the pace down and doesn't really add anything then its shot and shown. As its does here between the characters of G. H and Amanda. I'm sure there is no deleted scenes here! So, a potential 90min is stretched to 2hrs 20mins, with most of these scenes set. The first half effectively conveys the fear and added tension of society breaking down starting with the Internet,then an oil tanker aimlessly drifting towards the beach is well staged,if a little too CGI heavy and is timely with the COVID pandemic. The house and surroundings are lush and the acting is solid- Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke seem well suited and their daughter is sweet and curiously funny. Mahershala Ali is strong and humane but his daughter is an irritating unsympathetic young lady. Is she supposed to be on the spectrum? The scene where G. H explains,rather too conveniently, that his 'client' is involved with nefarious activities is added too little,too late. Surely, he would have mentioned this prior in the house with the others, why wait over 2hrs for this to be mentioned. Their relationships have matured,trust gained. An interesting film that I'll remember but could have been better in the scripting."
Leave the World Behind (2023),"Oh My God, They Hacked the Deer","Contender for film of the decade, Leave the World Behind isn't a disaster-survival movie any more than Sam Esmail's Mr. Robot is a series about computer hacking. To appreciate this film, the viewer must temper expectations of realism and a survivalist's type of closure - whether all ends well for the characters depends entirely on the audience. The relevance of this film is in how perfectly it captures the stress-induced exhaustion of the American public since... let's say 2016. Like in The Road, the nature of the attack is intentionally vague, and the events shown somewhat illogical. Like an impressionist painting, the conveyed feeling of impending doom matters more than the content detail. In an era where half of Americans polled think a civil war is inevitable, but nobody can say exactly how it will happen, highlighting the dysfunction in our society is more material than the mechanics of the umpteenth tale of doom and destruction. Each character can be interpreted as representing different perspectives on the American Left. Through this lens, the film is an introspective critique and warning that the fragmentary nature of the Left can be its undoing, a frequent public speaking point of a certain former president who happens to be one of the film's producers. Amanda is an educated, upper-middle-class suburban white woman blissfully unaware of how deeply conservative many of her preconceptions about people really are. Her job as a salesperson puts her at odds with her espoused political beliefs and she reconciles this by rationalizing that everyone else is just as two-faced and distrustful. She claims to be disgusted by the endless economic striving, the petty competitiveness of the city where everyone climbs over one another towards success. She says she wants to leave the world behind, but the vacation she plans is nothing more than a celebration of the capitalist virtues she claims to be fleeing - paying thousands of dollars to pretend, for a time, having acquired a massive house in the Hamptons close to the beach. The Sandfords aren't exactly leaving for the mountains of the Yukon. Their vacation isn't a change of location but rather a change of socioeconomic status. Not until the end of the movie, when her daughter is at risk, does Amanda abandon her preconceptions about professions, status, wealth, race, etc. And embrace Ruth as a person, not as a con artist or a spoiled brat or anything else, but just as a person. Clay is an educated, upper-middle-class suburban white man whose shortcoming is indecision. Like so many of his peers on the academic left, he thinks that simply being inoffensive will suffice. He's going to watch the world burn content in the knowledge that he didn't make any enemies along the way. He doesn't ask the Scotts for ID when they show up at the door in the middle of the night because he's afraid of being offensive. He tries to remove himself from the tension between Amanda and the Scotts rather than being an effective mediator. When finally forced to make a decision about helping someone, he locks up and runs away from a Hispanic woman in distress. Being forced to take a stand sends him into such a panic that he flees like a maniac from what ends up being harmless paper flyers. Not until the end of the movie, when his son is at risk, does Clay become an effective mediator, symbolically positioning himself between a successful black man and a working-class white survivalist. Rose, sporting a NASA shirt, has her head in the clouds for most of the film. She feels more connected with the cast of Friends than with her family or anyone else around her. Despite being the youngest and not even having been alive when Friends aired, she seems to have, as Ruth puts it, a nostalgia for a time that never really existed. The appeal of shows like Friends certainly isn't the comedic writing, which was awful, it's the comfort of a close, reliable community. Rose represents the younger post-pandemic generation, estranged from personal relationships, confused by politics and the world at large, and seeking shelter in the simplicity of media, especially romanticization of a more functional society where people were ""there for you"". Before leaving the Sandfords, it's worth mentioning that, like most of the viewing public, they're unaware of the references to America's racial history sprinkled throughout the film. Knowledge of the past empowers us, and when we're ignorant of the White Lion landing at Point Comfort in 1619, it leaves us powerless, unequipped when scars of the past come back ashore with massive force, renting the very fabric of the nation asunder. Once again, passivity is insufficient. Active engagement is essential. Ruth's specialty is active engagement. She has no problem calling out the other characters on their shortcomings and she's not afraid of being confrontational. But her assessments are often shallow and incomplete. She's a gatekeeper of the liberal cause; she wants to drive other people out of her house, throw away potential allies and isolate herself and her father. At the end of the movie, she acknowledges the overlap in her beliefs with Amanda and they become allies against the... spooky deer. G. H. Is the most difficult character to analyze. He's a successful black man who's been forced to live in the basement of his own home, a room which, is architecturally quite different from the rest of the house - darker, with more wood, almost reminiscent of the bowels of a slave ship. Yet he takes all of this in stride, he's the bigger man. He doesn't get angry but remains calm and shows magnanimity to those around him. He's in a relative position of power, having received some forewarning from his friend at the Pentagon as well as being the only member of the group holding a gun. He could have driven the Scotts out of the house at any time, but he lets them stay and more than that he lets them stay in comfort. Through the whole series of events, he must be asking himself ""what do I owe any of these people?"" He finally breaks when, after giving so much of himself, he encounters his neighbor, the survivalist, who has completely abandoned all the virtues of a functional society and embraced an animalistic survival-of-the-fittest mentality. ""Why am I doing so much when this guy won't even lift a finger to help?"" It's the principle of the thing that makes G. H. pull the gun on him. In a lot of ways, I see our former president in the G. H. character - frustrated with the people around him, both allies and enemies, and struggling to hold true to a core set of principles that seem increasingly irrelevant in the contemporary landscape. The movie ends with Rose watching the last episode of Friends. At least she gets closure. As for the audience, all we're left with is a call to action. Will we be there for each other when the rain starts to fall?"
Leave the World Behind (2023),Please Don't watch.,"This movie was so insanely bad, but it made you feel like something was going to happen, so you keep watching. Two and a half hours later you leave with no good conclusion and a genuine hate towards the directors, and producers for wasting your time. (It's also not silly/bad enough to watch it as a laugh). Since I have extra characters I'll just continue to say how terrible this movie is. I was close to a balcony when I was watching this and I would have jumped if I didn't want to write my first review with the whole purpose of putting at least one person off this movie in hopes of taking money of whichever disappointment wrote this garbage."
Leave the World Behind (2023),"A stylish, downright unnerving mystery.","Leave The World Behind may not be for everyone, but from its very first scene, I was mesmerized by it. The sense of unease, relentless dread, and mystery it presented throughout its 136 minutes were masterful and surreal in equal measure. It's a slow burn, more of a character study than an outright apocalyptic disaster thrill ride, but the immense suspense and tension the movie delivered were downright unnerving at times. Additionally, it benefits from being directed with panache and style by Sam Esmail and boasting a cast to die for, all bringing their A-game. The lack of answers or payoff may be frustrating for some, but I didn't care because the journey itself was movie-making at its suspenseful best. I loved it."
Leave the World Behind (2023),Movie was good with no ending,"You'll read a lot of people saying that you're less than they are if you need an ending... Please, get over your selves!! This is a great movie that has no ending. I get it, assume it all went well and they all met up and lived like a happy family in a bunker. It doesn't end that way, in fact, it doesn't end. If you're okay with that watch this movie it's great till then. Believe me when I say this movie will abruptly stop and you'll be irritated. The geniuses that don't need an ending because their brain already wrote it, will tell you you're stupid for needing one. I need one, 4 stars. Enjoy if you watch :)"
Leave the World Behind (2023),"Strong start, weak finish","Good movie. Plenty of suspense, good mystery and good movement throughout. The first half is great. Strong suspense with danger in the air. A great stuck-in-a-cabin setup. The interlopers are just suspicious enough to cast doubt. After a good opening and strong second act, it quickly breaks down. And abruptly stops with no plot resolution. Overall it all felt very familiar. Like it's a movie I've seen before. It must have borrowed extensively from other disaster movies. It didn't exactly energize me. I wish the second half could live up to the premise. But it felt like the first part of a trilogy. In a bad way."
Leave the World Behind (2023),So mad at the director,"This seemed like it could have been such a good movie. Good actors, good premise. But the direction seemed horrible. Like self-important, fresh-from-film-school kind of directing. I was amazed to see that the director is in his 40's and has actually worked before. The angles, the pacing, the dramatic tension, the acting direction... all just... off... but not even in a clever, artistic way... just poorly done. It seemed like he watched Hitchcock and M. Night Shyamalan and thought... how can I copy this but make it not work as well? An example:
Julia Roberts can act... we've seen her do it before, she's got the skills... but that was a horrible performance. It seemed like she was told to do ""bitter old white lady Karen"" and then while trying to act had someone screaming ""More bitterness! More anger!!"" at her. She seemed so much like a caricature that it took away from the movie. The same goes for the character Mahershala Ali played. So ""pensive and brooding"".... I swear it seemed like he kept trying to tone it down but all the long takes and horrible lines lines. There was just so much potential with this film... for the art, the entertainment value and for the message. It's so frustrating that it was dealt such a poor hand. I'm planning to go read the book now because I'm hoping so much that it is better than this."
Leave the World Behind (2023),One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Well that's 2 hours and 21 minutes I will never get back. Clearly the creators of this movie are Friends obsessed. The ""scary"" music was a joke. You know a movie is bad when Ethan Hawk is not even the worst part of the movie. If it was not such a stupid movie, it would be laughable. It was so disjointed. Are they or are they not going to reveal what George really knows? Did he or did he not kill his wife? They never explain why the deer were all 'Stare down at the okay corral'. Speaking of which, the stare down deer looked so fake, now that was laughable. It's like this was some college student's laughable attempt at creating an Hitchcock-esk movie but failing miserably."
Leave the World Behind (2023),Buildup with little payoff,"Based on the book by Rumaan Alam, Leave the World Behind is the story of two families forced to coexist in a posh house while surviving a series of mysterious, catastrophic events befalling America. Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke are Amanda and Clay Sandford, a misanthropic wife and much more chill husband. Amanda makes the sudden decision to rent a vacation home on Long Island and takes the family along. Their daughter Rose is obsessed with the TV show Friends, and their son Archie is the typical rude and horny teenager. Their vacation takes a sudden turn when an oil tanker crashes on the beach. That night they are startled when the homeowner, Mahershala Ali's George and his daughter Ruth, arrive looking for shelter after things go awry in the city. Egos clash as Ruth has no tolerance for Amanda's acerbic personality, but George and Ruth are allowed to stay for the night. Things only escalate from their as internet, phones, and TV signals die out. Animals begin behaving erratically and there's strange weather patterns. Are these signs of a cyber attack? An invasion? Something biblical? Uh... don't hold your breath on a clear answer. Kevin Bacon is here too as the survivalist Danny, but he's an extended cameo at best. This is a bottle movie that mostly takes place in one location with a handful of characters. The problem with Leave the World Behind is that it's almost entirely buildup to a payoff that doesn't exist. There is no closure. The plot goes out of its way to raise as many questions about the nature of the catastrophe as possible, and then puts just as much energy into avoiding providing any real answers. You will get speculation from the characters at best. Movies don't need to answer every question, but you do want your audience to feel like their time wasn't wasted once the credits roll. This movie feels like it ends in the middle of the third act. That said, this isn't actually a bad movie. It's well shot, the performances are fine (no one was given a lot to work with), music choices in the first half are fire, it does build suspense, etc. There just isn't a lot of substance to go with it. We get something that's closer to glimpses into these characters than any real development or arcs. Amanda thaws out a bit and is self-aware of her abrasiveness. Clay goes from chill to freaked all the way out. George's optimism shrivels away as he reveals that he thinks things are much worse than any of them anticipated. Nothing really changes with the kids. Leave the World Behind is more of a misfire, some wasted potential rather than an outright disaster. I've never read the book, but it was well-received. Maybe this concept just works better on paper? Either way, not Sam Esmail's best."
Leave the World Behind (2023),This should have been a short,"Casting is great which leads to Acting is that is top notch. Filled with greatly executed scenes. The story is fascinating. Cinematography is almost always on point. Set design is fitting. Some messages about our society could be read, if interpreted kindly. However. There is a very active camera. To say the least. The score is an acquired taste to put it mildly. Some character actions are somewhat out there. If you want thoughtful and insightful observations on mankind, humans or relations - look elsewhere. This film is over two hours long. With content for about 20 minutes. If this were a short film, or maybe a proof of concept, it would be great. But as it stands now it's the longest set up I've ever seen. And the end is just perfect!"
Maestro (2023),Almost a travesty and it makes me sad,"I really wanted to love the film. I love Lenny, I grew up with the young people's concerts, with his Broadway musicals, his amazing working collaboration with Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, Arthur Laurent, Comden and Green. I grew up knowing of his love for Israel, his love of religion, his spiritual relationship to God - always found in his quotes and passion. This is a love story without passion, a love story that doesn't make any sense. A love story that falls flat! It's the fault of the script not the acting. It is a fault in the direction. So much could have been done to surround and strengthen the love story but it just doesn't work. Even with the Spielberg and Scorse producing - it's another failed Netflix flop Yes wonderful to see the acting skills of Brad Cooper the great make up, the change of life, and congratulations on that. There are even moments when you can feel how Brad is channeling Lenny, but it isn't enough, there aren't enough of those moments. Carey Mulligan does a good job, but a bit miscast. And who's who in this story? It isn't clear and what music is being played - never indicated. And what years are we in, that too not indicated. Lenny deserved better than this - he really did. We know he loved the boys but he loved his family, his music and he loved God even more! And you completely ignored that."
Maestro (2023),Carey Mulligan 10/10,"She carried the lack of plot and constant distractions. Bradley Cooper did a good job as well but Mulligan absolutely stole the show. As a director Cooper shows some promise but there's an obvious lack of direction and connection between all the points of the composer's life shown throughout the film. Left much to be desired and still felt drawn out. The side characters left little to no impact as there was no reason to care about their existence. And, though the focus on the couple's marriage was nicely done, I was left only feeling empathy for his wife and did not care about the Maestro at all."
Maestro (2023),Carey Mulligan .. Great prosethic nose but...,"What an indulgent pointless waste of talent and time. Leaves one wondering why anyone cares about Bernstein or did since it tells you absolutely nothing about his incredible work and impact on music. Don't waste your time. Bradley Cooper clearly lost his way in this story....it really is sort of irrelevant that it's about Bernstein...it fails to provide markers of his career, the passage of time, the many many collaborators, even his artistic process or the work of bringing them to the public. The much heralded Mahler symphony piece is just tedious, indulgent and frankly painful to watch. Bleech!"
Maestro (2023),"Portrait of a Marriage, not of a Conductor/Composer","I can't fault the performances of anyone in the cast, although Cooper and Mulligan talked over each other frequently, making it difficult to understand what either of them was saying. Perhaps this was done intentionally to make it seem more realistic, but a good bit of the dialogue between the two was unintelligible. Cooper's prosthetic nose was convincing and created a good likeness, but I kept wondering how Lenny could stay so tan when most of his time was spent inside or in concert halls. My disappointment with the movie is that it was too much about the Bernsteins' marriage difficulties and not enough about the the genius and inspiration of the musician/composer/conductor. If one is looking for a biopic of Leonard Bernstein, this isn't it."
Maestro (2023),This is a movie about Bernstein's wife. Not his life.,"Wow, I did not expect such a bland and uninteresting movie, with a heavy moral on how bad homosexuality is according to his wife (who knew about his homosexuality from the start), who never stops glancing at him with disgust. Leonard Bernstein was a genius, his life was mesmerizing and complex. This movie is bland, despite its wonderful masks (which deserve Oscars) but I cannot recommend this if you want to learn something about Bernstein. It's okay if you want to learn about the pains of a wife, who has married a gay man and who later ends up getting cancer. Almost nothing about West Side Story, Bernstein's impact on the musical world, his style, his *life*. This is uninteresting it is painful. I have pushed through this movie, hoping it would end in *something* but it didn't. Utterly painful and not worth of the genius of Leonard Bernstein."
Maestro (2023),"Great performances, not so great movie","Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan (specially Carey Mulligan) pour their hearts out for this epic bio, with outstanding performances. However, they don't completely save what is otherwise a superficial movie: there's a focus on their relationship, but not really on the characters. If Leonard Bernstein was ever ""The"" Maestro, you would never know by this movie. There's barely any focus on his relationship to music; there's barely any reflection on his persona, besides his attitude towards his wife. At the end, it is somewhat boring. Sure it looks pleasant from time to time, but I still found Cooper was playing with his direction techniques. It's not amateur, it's actually far from that, but it's not cohesive. Looks like he wants to do a grand-movie and simply tries different approaches from scene to scene. Sound editing was brilliant. So, this is a Hollywood movie about a couple. What they do, who they are, doesn't really seem to matter. For a biopic, it's bland. For an acting-exercise, it sure was good."
Maestro (2023),Carey Mulligan carries this Oscar-bait of a film,"This is a film by Bradley Cooper with Bradley Cooper for Bradley Cooper. It feels artificial in the sense that it is clearly a project made with the award season in mind. It carries all the cliche tricks (physical transformation, artsy black and white scenes, heartbreaking drama...). Sometimes it even felt like watching a weird fusion of La la Land and The Artist. This is a pity because the beginning with an interesting camera work and pace was very promising alas, that pace turns out to be the demise of the film. You jump from scene to scene with little to no explanation leaving you confused and hungry for more especially if you are not familiar with Berstein's life and work. As for the acting, Bradley Cooper reenacts famous interviews, not adding much dimension in my opinion, while Carey Mulligan delivers an incredible performance from start to finish with a deeply moving final act that."
Maestro (2023),Unusual and rather intellectual approach,"I don't think it's possible to grasp just how great this movie is. How easy it would have been to succumb to the temptation to glorify a gigantic genius called Bernstein, illustrate it with music and make a spectacle out of it that everyone would like. Bradley Cooper chose not to do any of that, but to focus on just one aspect of Bernstein's life, namely his relationship with his wife Felicia, whom he loved and with whom he had children, but whom he did not desire. Bradley Cooper makes this Bernstein appear as a person who has faults, who is weak, but who also barely knows how to tame his own genius and whose desperation at having to choose between composing and conducting is made visible without much fuss. Carey Mulligan is a great player, without a doubt. But I miss the nuances of this initially somewhat over-excited woman, who slowly realizes that her husband tends to hang out with men, even though that was the condition of the marriage from the beginning. The moment in which Bernstein conducts the finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 is so cleverly chosen that one could probably write a doctoral thesis on Cooper's motif or on the function that this work, which is nicknamed the ""Resurrection Symphony"", takes on at this point. A remarkable film and an incredibly good piece of work. Cooper's second directorial effort. My goodness, there's a lot more to come. I'm looking forward to it."
Maestro (2023),Sort of interesting,"But not interesting enough to get by the cartoon nose; it's very distracting. The acting is good but I didn't feel any chemistry between Cooper and Mulligan, or Cooper and Bomer for that matter. The story line is somewhat choppy; snapshots of high points in Bernstein's life, skipping years at some points. There isn't any character development; there isn't much of a plot. It's almost like watching an old newsreel. I'd rather read an in-depth biography of Bernstein. The clothing is interesting and the music is enjoyable, but I wish there was more music and some background on Bernstein's works. I think they could have done a better job."
Maestro (2023),Another Horrible Movie by Bradley Coooper,"Honestly, Lost all respect for Cooper after how he misbehaved while demanding awards for the worthless remake of ""a star is born."" Remember how they campaigned for awards, pretending he and Gaga were so in love, give us the Oscar. With this movie, Cooper has completely rewritten the story to fit his oscar attempts, not to enlighten us of Mr. Bernstein's life story. Bernstein's children and associates were justifiably critical of this movir, which is Cooper's cherrypicked vision and not at all a complete depiction of genius stuggles of Mr. Bernstein. Better to watch the PBS biography than waste time with Cooper's rewriting for his own delusuion once again. A bomb at the Box Office and justifiably so. One wishes Cooper could find another ""Las Vegas"" type comedy to redeem his pretentious career. At this rate, he has little chance of redemption with his previous fans. This is the last time to attempt to watch his movie for me. All I see is a man demanding awards and trotting out Gaga to do so once again."
The Iron Claw (2023),"This movie broke me, I love it","It's more of 9.5/10 but either way the iron claw was a fantastic film. It's a film abt brotherly love and overall family , and ik their a wrestling family but the wrestling side of it was bigger then I thought it was gunna be (which im glad cause those sequences was really good ) I'll start off with negatives first , Mikes suicide . He stated that David's death , along with the pressure of ppl wanting him to be David and ofc his injury which led to his toxic shock syndrome led to his suicide. I wish they did a better job at exploring the pressure he felt of tryna live up to that expectations, and that just show him grieving to show how much he really misses David . If that was better executed, his death woulda hit harder to me . Another is they shoulda aged the characters physically a lot more. 14 years had passed from David's first match to Kerry winning the IC title , and if Kevin didn't have 2 kids abt 10, it woulda been hard to tell 4 years had passed in the movie Positives: Some great acting , camera work was great too . The ending was emotional and beautiful. Kerry's suicide after talking to Kevin abt it was emotional, and Kevin's anger's towards his dad for not tryna step in and help Kerry was acted so good . And just Kerry reuniting and hugging his brothers , including Jack too (who died when Kerry was like a toddler or before he was born ) that was just beautiful. And then Kevin watching his kids playing football , reminded him of his brothers was emotional. And I don't think one line in any movie had hit harder then ""I used to be a brother "". Zac's performance throughout the movie was good , nothing great like what I had been hearing but he was good . But man after that ending , he deserves to atleast get nominated for an award."
The Iron Claw (2023),The tragic story of the Von Eric family,"The Von Erich family is one of the most incredible wrestling families in the sport's history. The four brothers all grew into adults, followed in their father's footsteps, and tried to do what he never had the opportunity to achieve: to be The World Champion. Unfortunately for them, they were cursed and destined for tragedy. This fantastic film shares the tragic story of the Von Erich family and their contribution to the sport of pro wrestling. The story shares the strong bond between the brothers and the toxic parenting they had to endure. The movie gives a bit of history on the business of pro wrestling, the competing organizations, and some famous wrestlers. The movie is long but gets to the point quickly and only spends a little time on minor details. The film is entertaining and engaging for hardcore wrestling fans and people who know nothing about it. It is worth a watch in theaters or when streamable."
The Iron Claw (2023),"The Iron Claw, it earns its tears honestly.","I had only a passing knowledge of the Von Erich family before going to see THE IRON CLAW, knowing that they were stars on the pro-wrestling circuit back in the '80s when images of the brothers graced the covers of those wrestling magazines on the racks in drug and grocery stores. Turns out there was a real story behind those photos, one that true fans came to know, and now, thanks to this film, the whole world has a chance to learn. This is a sports movie, but it is not about an underdog doing what it takes to become a champ, it is much more about persevering in the face of unimaginable tragedy. The four Von Erich brothers were raised in Texas by their father, Fritz, a minor wrestling star of the '50s who never achieved the success in the ring he desired, but, like many fathers with failed ambitions, was determined that his boys-Kevin, Kerry, David, and Michael-would succeed where he fell short. He pushed his sons hard to become bigger and stronger, to instill in them a drive to make whatever sacrifice necessary to get to wear that champion's belt. The story is told through the eyes of Kevin, who witnessed what happened to his brothers, and the unfortunate fates that befell them in pursuit of their father's dream. As it has been noted, pro-wrestling might have been ""fake,"" but the injuries were real. The film takes some liberties with the facts, including leaving one son completely out because his story would have been just too much tragedy for the film to handle. Some might wonder why didn't any of these sons rebel, or say no when they got big enough, but as the film makes very clear, the Von Erich brothers truly loved each other, and Texas pro-wrestling, which was particularly brawling back in the day, was in their blood. It would have been easy for the film to make Fritz Von Erich into one of those awful Bad Dads that drive the plots in a lot of similar dramas, but, as played by Holt McCallany, Fritz gets his way by being emotionally manipulative, domineering when he has to be, but never raising a hand to his boys despite the violent nature of the way they made their living. Though he makes no secret of who his favorites are, you do feel that Fritz did love all of his children. He was just one of those men who did it his way. Along with McCallany, this film is so perfectly cast with Harris Dickinson as David, probably the most gifted Von Erich when it came to presenting himself in the ring. Jeremy Allan White is Kerry, who would have competed in the Olympics if not for the American boycott of Moscow in 1980, who falls back into the family business afterward, though it is clear that lost opportunity weighed very heavy on him. Stanley Simons is Mike, the youngest brother, who has an artistic side, and whom we fear for from the minute he is introduced. All of them are good, but the anchor of the film is Zac Efron as Kevin, the older brother who was never quite the star in his father's eyes, but who became the rock the others leaned on. Bulked up to look like a mini-Hulk, Efron gives a terrific performance, maybe the best work he's ever done, and refutes those who thought him a pretty boy and a lightweight. Lily James is Pam, the tough Texas girl Kevin married, who became the rock he leaned on, and probably the reason why he was the one brother who ultimately survived what came to be called the ""Von Erich curse."" Maura Tierney is Doris, the matriarch of the family, who is asked to endure more than any mother should. But whoever they got to play Ric Flair doesn't come anywhere near close to capturing the outsized personality of ""The Nature Boy."" Director and screenwriter Sean Durkin clearly has great affection for this material, it has plenty of heart and sympathy. Durkin manages to recreate the '80s very well, a time when Americans could go and have a good time without being taken to task for it, back before the raging culture wars and the digital age made the country so divided and judgmental. One of THE IRON CLAW's real strengths is that it doesn't have a political agenda; it just has a story to tell, one that many people will find relatable. And it sure earns its tears honestly, especially in that reunion scene late in the film, and Kevin's moment with his own sons at the end. I would go so far as to say, with all due respect to Daren Aronofsky and Mickey Rourke, that this is the better wrestling film."
The Iron Claw (2023),Too Broad and distant to connect,"I was so looking forward to having my heart tugged from this true story I previously knew nothing about. There is so much tragedy in this story, but sadly the script keeps the characters at arms length, that we never get to really know them enough to connect with them. Sure the story is naturally sad as is the nightly news, but like the news we don't get close enough to the subjects to truly feel their loss. The acting is fine. It looks good, but it ultimately feels rather empty and too broad to leave any genuine impact. Maybe if I had known their story before and I had something to bring to the table I could have connected better. The father character was so broad and lacked any nuance. The mother we barely get to understand her motivations and while the sons are all likably performed, we never get to know what truly makes them tick. Big letdown from A24."
The Iron Claw (2023),Iron claw,The movie was great the story was great I am a wrestling fan and I loved this movie I knew the deaths were coming but still cried the actors did awesome the only thing I hated was that the person who played ric flair was terrible other than that everyone was perfect I loved how well Zach Efron did and I feel like he deserves a Oscar and the movie deserves awards it was the best wrestling movie I have seen in my lifetime while the movie was tragic and made me tear up I felt the love the brother had and if your gonna watch this movie be ready cause it's a tear fest but the movie was great and award winning.
The Iron Claw (2023),VIEWS ON FILM review of The Iron Claw,"I've always thought of Zac Efron to be a very talented actor. He's charismatic, with a gleaming, devil-may-care attitude. With 2023's The Iron Claw, Efron shines as real-life wrestler Kevin Von Erich. He totally immerses himself in the role, with a blistering screen presence that's off the charts. ""You feel that, you feel that, that's pressure"". Oh yeah. Now is The Iron Claw the best film of 2023? No but it's certainly in the team photo. The pic is a slow-mounting drama that at certain moments, hits you like a ton of bricks (or a clothesline if you know what I mean). And does ""Claw"" provide the audience with a sterling sense of time and place? Oh you know it. The complete effect is staggering, a sort of vaulted escapism via the late 70s and early-to-mid 80s. Yup, there were times when I was getting some serious Reagan Era vibes. Radical! The story of The Iron Claw is a true one, about the rise and fall of the wrestling Von Erich brothers, their mildly cold father, and the tragedies that seem to have accompanied their so-called, cursed family. ""Claw"" clocks in at 132 elongated minutes, with unassumingly brilliant editing by Matthew Hannam. Sure the flick has that ""goes on and on and on"" feel to it but there's stuff to appreciate. An earthy, gritty look, authenticity in the time period, raw acting, ripped character alteration, and violently blunt, grappling scenes. ""Claw's"" director (Sean Durkin), well he unintentionally goes into Bennett Miller territory here, offering the moviegoer a sort of expanded companion piece to 2014's Foxcatcher. Bottom line: The Iron Claw is powerfully realized and well, powerfully depressing. It doesn't have much of an arc, a kind of hard documentary with troupers inserted. Oh well. You'll leave the theater numb and distraught anyway so it's probably worth it. ""Dragon's claw""."
The Iron Claw (2023),"Yes, but why?","This should have been a homerun for me. I am wrestling fan as well as drama fan. But this movie never connected with for three simple reasons. One, there are movies that take place in another time period that look like the time period did and there a movies where it feels like: oh threy dressed up to make it look like from that period. I don't know if the boys wear wigs but either way it looks ridiculous. Secondly: Zac Efron. I wrote this when he was portraying a serial killer and I will say it again: He is not yet convinced me that he is more than eye candy to a movie. He afflecks the part. He has one facial impression the entire movie. Only difference is, he can add a tear to it. Maybe he is able to act but he hides it well. And third, why does all his happen to the boys which should be the most central part here. Sure, her dad is very tough on them but you don't see enough of it to make you understand why they would kill themself. You get only a glimpse of the steriod abuse or the drug use or the pressure of performing night and night out no matter your physical condition. All this combined with the father pressuring them would have given you an explanaton of what really happened."
The Iron Claw (2023),Almost...,"I'm familiar with the Von ERICHs growing up as a wrestling fan and Vice's documentary. Thought there would be oscars all around... There was a point in the film where I think the editing was a bit off. Not a horrible film, but not the powerful film needed. Vice's DARK SIDE OF THE RING on the VON ERICH's is much better. The acting in this film wasn't what I expected. This film might hit different for people who aren't familiar with their story. Not a horrible film, but some things aren't working. Again, I really wanted to like this film, but it doesn't deliver and there are some issues with the way some of the scenes were executed."
The Iron Claw (2023),Not everyday you change your top 5 movies,"Wow. I expected a muscle mania approach to this movie. What I got was dialoge, spacing, beats and proper tones that hit your heart strings with large plucks. Nothing fancy or over the top, great choreographed fight scenes and expert hair cuts. What a show! Will be a re watch in my house hold and will be bragging about it to my friends and family. Wasn't born in the 70's but I get that 70's vibe accurately I would say. The family dynamics are great, would have loved to see more of the mother, but that's okay, it is forgiven due to the fact the movie focuses on the brothers. Also happy to see other wrestlers without giving their names on screen taking away from the story. Except for Rick Flar l."
The Iron Claw (2023),"A BEAUTIFUL, DEVASTATING FILM","I'm currently leaving the movie theater speechless and emotional. I am completely gutted. This movie sheds a whole new light on the wrestling world...but also on the tragic story of wrestling's most famous family. I went into this film only knowing the basics of this family's story and I'm leaving wanting to know more. The performances in this movie are beyond incredible. Obviously Zac Efron is a very recognizable face in Hollywood. But in this you forget you are watching him because he is completely lost in this character. Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, and Stanley Simons all give equally fantastic performances as his brothers. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE YOU WANT TO MISS."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Best Movie I've Watched,"I have watched many good movies in my time. Oppenheimer is the cream of the crop. This movie is a biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, it is so much more than that. Within this 3 hour movie, there is so much going on and so much to be learnt. I have always believed that movies have a meaning and we can learn many things from them. To me Oppenheimer shows how someone who is so smart can be so naive. Many times in the movie Dr Oppenheimer is shown to be doing things which are clearly detrimental to his reputation. Yet he doesn't seem to understand that. For example, he was carrying out union meetings inside the university when the recruitment for the Manhattan project was taking place. Another thing which stood out for me in this movie is the saying ""what comes around goes around"". Strauss played a very dirty game against Dr Oppenheimer because he was humiliated by Dr Oppenheimer. Dr Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and credibility as a consequence of Strauss's actions. Strauss was refused by Senate as a Cabinet nominee because Dr Hill came forward to bring to light what Strauss had done to Dr Oppenheimer. Something to note is that the 2 times we saw Dr Hill and Dr Oppenheimer together, Dr Oppenheimer was seemingly mean to Dr Hill. Despite that Dr Hill still stood up and told the truth. Oppenheimer has done everything to perfection. The writing, directing, acting and the iconic music score. I have seen many of Christopher Nolan's work and I do believe this might just be his masterpiece. I have watched this movie twice now and I will definitely be watching it many more times to come."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Complicated Theatrical Rendition of a Complicated Individual,"With Oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director Christopher Nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. The slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case Nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. As he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors. Here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of World War 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. Oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. This style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in Tenet, Inception and Dunkirk. Here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. I've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour I felt like I'd just read most of it all over again. This time with a little extra dramatic pizazz. It's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the Trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. I loved every moment, but then, I was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. My wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. I think this may be more of a knock on Oppenheimer the man than Oppenheimer the film. A complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. Nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty. Perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but I'm not sure where I'd want to see a cut. Certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, Nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Beyond boring,"I wanted to watch this due to it being a Christopher Nolan film. I'm so glad I only blew $6 renting it. I'm not sure how anyone could rate this above two stars. This entire movie is monotone and a complete waste of time. Good story but hard to get into the movie. Possibly the most boring form of entertainment I've ever seen. Not only that....it goes on and on for three freaking hours of just talking. This movie has only one thing going for it and that would be the name of the director. To say I'm disappointed would be a massive understatement. If you choose to watch it.....that's on you. Don't read the good reviews, most are fake."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Good film,"A cool miniseries. I watched it in three days. I was really more interested in the bomb production part, so everything that came out about post-war political intrigue and McCarthyism didn't interest me as much. Everything about the organization of the Manhattan Project, the organization of Los Alamos, discussions about physics and bomb testing were very interesting to me, I loved those parts. I think putting the main character in an audience where he had to explain all his actions was a cheesy and lazy script device. Just as I found Lewis Strauss' idea of explaining everything he thought and planned to his own advisors to be very absurd. Shouldn't they already know all this? I also didn't understand why the Lewis Strauss scenes were in black and white. It didn't make much sense to me. I think the exaggerated soundtrack contributed to making the film more interesting, otherwise the story could have been quite boring. The performances from everyone involved were very good but especially from Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr., I also liked Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr. I understood the idea of the film: he made the bomb but felt guilty about the deaths and spent the next few years trying to stop the hydrogen bomb from being made. Interesting, I just think it was told in a rather boring way. In the end, a very good film. It would have been a fantastic film if it had focused less on the post-war period and more on Oppenheimer's life before the war. Although I don't know much about his life, I think it would have been more interesting to see his academic life before the bomb rather than his post-war political persecutions."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Why can't anyone give him a pair of scissors,"Murphy is brilliant, but that is the only great with this movie. Another too long Nolan piece, why can't anyone give him a pair of scissors? You need to be able to tell you story in 120 minutes, max. There were some old epic movies, that could handle 180 minutes, but that's rare. Tarantino has a record of 168 minues in The Hateful Eight, and even that Tarantino's movie took place mostly in a cabin, Hateful Eight is not as boring as Oppenheimer. The only good thing is that I watched Pppnenjeimer at home, and not at the cinema. Longer is not always better. I felt the same as I did in ""Dark knight rises"" the movie is not geting anywhere. And this jumping back and forward? Why? At least have the courtsey to add date and place in the movie. Very few people undrstand that the security hearing was 1954 and Strauss senate hearing was 1959. It's a confusing way to tell a story. Summary
Another boring Nolan movie. He's overrated, and actually Barbie was the winner of the Barbenheimer fight."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Nolan's best movie.,"I really really really really liked this movie. I probably loved this movie lightly. Yes it drags a little, but most of the movie is very very very great. The acting is fantastic, especially from Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, etc. Florence Pugh was even pretty good. The plot went well, actually, it was super confusing at the start but it got much more easier and simple near the end. The end of the hearing, while the end result is quite depressing, the arguements and again acting was super great. The visual design was beautiful, the sound design was actually quite mixed, because most of it was fine, especially during the Trinity Test, but the arguements and stuff occasionally was hard to hear. Senate hearings, politicans talking in a room, etc was made exciting in this movie. Just a great great movie!"
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Best film of 2023,"If any movie this year deserves to to be in my top ten list, it's definitely Oppenheimer. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a richly complex and entertaining film. The first hour flys by and is compelling as hell. The ""can you hear the music?"" scene is one of the best Nolan's directed, and it's just greatly paced. The second hour is extremely morally challenging as characters question whether or not they should use the bomb. The Trinity Test was incredibly shot and editing, the practical effects are stunning yet terrifying. The third and last hour is probably my favorite part of the film, as it deals with guilt and punishment. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.'s performances stand out like a sore thumb. And finally the ending is one of the best and most terrifying endings that sticks with you and lingers in your mind for a while after viewing the film. Overall an excellent experience in 70mm and awesome 4K release. Oppenheimer is definitely the best film of the year."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Openheimer: A Masterpiece Unveiling the Depths of Human Complexity,"Title: ""Openheimer: A Masterpiece Unveiling the Depths of Human Complexity"" Rating: 10/10 ""Openheimer"" is a cinematic tour de force that not only explores the life of the brilliant physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer but also delves into the complex moral and ethical implications of scientific advancements. Directed by visionary filmmaker chris nolan, this biographical drama is a mesmerizing journey through the mind of a man whose contributions to science changed the course of history. The film opens with a captivating portrayal of Oppenheimer's early years, providing a nuanced understanding of his intellect, struggles, and personal conflicts. Actor cillian murphy delivers an exceptional performance, seamlessly embodying the complexity of Oppenheimer's character, from his academic pursuits to the moral dilemmas he faced during the development of the atomic bomb. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the essence of each era in Oppenheimer's life with meticulous attention to detail. The juxtaposition of intense scientific discussions with personal moments creates a compelling narrative that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. What sets ""Openheimer"" apart is its unflinching exploration of the ethical implications of scientific progress. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the moral ambiguity surrounding Oppenheimer's role in the Manhattan Project and the devastating consequences of the atomic bombings. It invites viewers to reflect on the dual nature of scientific advancements - their potential for both good and harm. The musical score, composed by ludwig goransson complements the film beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The use of period-appropriate music further immerses the audience in the historical setting, creating a sensory experience that resonates long after the credits roll. The supporting cast, including robert downey junior delivers standout performances, contributing to the overall authenticity of the narrative. The chemistry between characters adds depth to the storytelling, making the interpersonal dynamics as compelling as the scientific discussions. ""Openheimer"" is not just a biopic; it's a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. It challenges viewers to grapple with the consequences of scientific discovery and the responsibilities that come with knowledge. In an era where ethical considerations in science are more relevant than ever, this film serves as a poignant reminder of the power that rests in the hands of those who push the boundaries of human understanding. In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together historical accuracy, powerful performances, and a profound exploration of morality. It stands as a testament to the potential of film to both entertain and enlighten, earning its well-deserved 10/10 rating. This is a must-watch for anyone seeking a deep, intellectually stimulating cinematic experience."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),Yet another Chris Nolan pile of garbage,"I rarely quit watching rentals 30 minutes short of the ending - especially after spend six and a half bucks on it - but that is what I did last evening while viewing Oppenheimer. The story went ricocheting off in so many directions, some shot in black and white and some in color - most of them boring as if watching paint drying - that I really had no idea what the movie was trying to convey to the audience. And as in Nolan's Interstellar, the overpowering musical score that never let up was more distracting than complimenting. So, onto the Nolan garbage heap goes Oppenheimer, to join Tenet, Interstellar, and Inception. His Batman flicks were OK, but if they were on one of the streaming services that I pay for, I wouldn't bother watching any of them again. I did like Dunkirk, Man of Steel and The Prestige, however."
Oppenheimer (I) (2023),"Watched it once, never again.","I'm here for Cillian Murphy. I loved him as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders and I was really excited when I saw he was cast in this. But the film was boring. It was too long (obviously). It was too confusing. It was too scientific. There just wasn't as much action as I expected. Matt Damon looks really old in this as well which is scary for me as he was one of my favourite actors growing up! Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the story and the events behind it. Really refreshing to see Albert Einstein in a film. But as an entertainment piece it is not one I will be rushing to relive. (Oh and I probably wouldn't watch Barbie again either!)"
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),"It's a Wonderful Life: A Timeless 9/10 Classic, Jimmy Stewart's Stellar Performance and Emotional Depth Make it a Cinematic Gem for Every Generation.","It's a Wonderful Life, a solid 9, man! This classic might be in black and white, but don't let that fool you - it's a timeless emotional journey. Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is iconic, capturing the struggles and triumphs of an everyday man. The plot, centered around the 'what if' scenario of George never being born, weaves a narrative that tugs at the heartstrings, making you reflect on the impact of one individual's life on an entire community. The supporting cast adds layers of depth, and Clarence the angel brings a quirky charm to the whole 'guardian angel' concept. The small-town setting oozes nostalgia, and the film's messages about family, friendship, and the value of a single life are powerful. Despite being an older film, the themes are relevant, and the storytelling remains captivating, leaving you with a warm and fuzzy feeling long after the credits roll. Sure, some might find it a bit sentimental, but that's the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' It's a cinematic gem that not only stands the test of time but continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. A 9/10 because it's a heartwarming journey that reminds us of the profound impact our lives can have on those around us, and sometimes, it takes a bit of cinematic magic to appreciate the wonderfulness of life."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),Great movie,Great movie great cast great story this movie is what movie audiences needed after world war 2 it was great this movie makes you smile like the Movie Elf and Love Actually James Stewart is great in this movie Donna Reed is good too the kids at the end the angel gets it's wings line priceless I give this movie an A great movie great Christmas movie you can watch this movie any time it doesn't have to be Christmas. I recommend this movie and 1965's The Sound Of The Music with Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins.this movie is a feel movie I give this movie this movie should have won they don't make movies.
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),"""It's A Perfect Film!""","Forget just Christmas, this might be the greatest film ever made. Yet, the older I get, the more I see the even deeper meanings of fate and intervention. Here they are: -When George and Mary are throwing rocks at the house, George hits glass and makes his wish. Mary then hits glass herself and makes a wish for George to stay and to marry him. I believe it is her wish that sets the whole motion of the movie. As soon as she makes her wish, George's father has a stroke and George decides not to leave. -George saves his brother and in return loses hearing in his ear. Because Harry and all of George's friends join the military, it is assumed George would have done the same. Yet, he gets rejected because of his ear. I believe that because George is smart, cocky and more daring than his friends, it would be George's fate to die in war. Therefore his ear, saved his life. -When George is talking to his father at the dinner table, he tells his father that he couldn't live working in a boring office all day. His father humbly laughs it off and tells George that he believes they are making a difference. Because we can assume sons acts like their fathers, I believe his father thought just like George and also had a ""glimpse"" type experience that showed him the way of happiness. Then when George called him a ""Great guy"", the father, feeling finally content, died that night. -Clarence is reading Tom Sawyer. In that novel, the towns people think Tom has died. Tom sees his own funeral, and at first finds joy in it. However, then realizes how sad it makes him to see others be sad of his death. So, he reveals he's alive. This is the same concept George sees. He thinks he's better off dead, yet sees what would happen to people without him and changes his mind. -When George is praying to God for help, he gets it. However, the entire time he's in his ""glimpse"", he doesn't believe in the idea that Clarence was sent by God. He begs Clarence to get him back, but it doesn't happen. It's not until George says the words ""Please God"", that the snow starts falling and he's back to reality. This movie isn't about George creating a wonderful life, it's that George was given a wonderful life. All he had to do was acknowledge it."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),It's a Wonderful Life,"This film came out 76 years ago and it is still one of my favorite holiday movies of all time. The story is centered around good people in a small town. The main character, George Bailey is a good man that is very selfless and never worries about himself. He does such selfless acts all his life for the people of the community that he serves. He ends up having a huge mistake with his uncle taking a deposit to the bank on Christmas Eve, but his uncle loses the deposit and on that very day a bank auditor arrives. He now had to come up with the money lost but he does not have it. This is when his angle comes down and shows him that he is truly a good man that has a Wonderful Life. This is a great holiday movie that has so much meaning and spirit."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),The best Christmas film?,"This might not be my most watched Christmas film ever but I can say that it is most likely the best I have seen. The dialogue in this film is amazing and the storytelling is as good as it gets. We are watching a man whose life is slowly falling apart, but don't even notice because his life story in itself is so well written and directed. We also feel so connected to the main character so seamlessly up to the end of the film, as despite his flaws, he is an honest, good man It's a film so grounded in reality but still manages to stick the landing with the spiritual scenes which is what makes it stand out as a film and plays very well with the Christmas theme. It teaches the audience to appreciate what we have and to keep our heads up through life's adversities. It also teaches lessons of greed and how money, despite causing many issues in life, (which is an undeniable fact), isn't something you can let take over your life. It is a great film and one that focuses on substance over style, something where a lot of films do the opposite. There are a few editing/audio scuffs here and there and the cinematography isn't the most ambitious which could be score-lowering factors, but I just think there is way too much substance and care put into this film for it to be any lower. It is also worth noting the time period this film released in, which could of course play a factor. Overall, I think this is one of the most uplifting films ever and I'm sure at the time of its release it was huge for mental health and so on."

With a captivating script filled with intricate plots and beautiful developments, the film showcases stellar performances by James Stewart and Lionel Barrymore. Both Stewart and Barrymore skillfully embody the iconic hero and villain roles with perfection. In addition to delivering an exceptional setting, the movie provides an immersive experience with a narrative capable of touching any heart. On the flip side, the film addresses powerful themes such as depression, despair, and insignificance. It demonstrates its enduring relevance, resonating for many years beyond its initial release, solidifying its status as a Christmas classic that is sure to evoke a tear from your eyes. And always remember, ""No man is a failure who has friends!"""
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),A christmas classic that you will adore.,"A beautiful sincere Christmas story that's practically flawless in every aspect. I have to give the movie special praise for it's casting, acting, script, pacing. There's a reason this is often considered one of the greatest movies of all time. The film explores the life of one man played by James Stewart before we begin to see the clouds on the horizon for him. The film asks a question we should perhaps all ask ourselves, what would life be like for others if we had never existed? The film is thoroughly sentimental but also has it's darker moments too. I really treasure this movie and I think it can be enjoyed by practically anyone."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),It's a generous rating,"I guess I'm just a simpleton who ""can't appreciate"" older films and the acting and technical achievements ""in context"". These actors are absolute caricatures of themselves IMO, and I find Jimmy Stewart insufferable in general. This movie is overlong, overrated, overacted, and overhyped. This is NOT cynicism regarding the message, I actually love the sentiment of the film despite its religious propaganda overtones. I just find the movie saccharine beyond belief and cringy at every ""hee-haw"" turn, and Donna Reed is about the only actor I don't want to spontaneously combust. My rating would be a 2 if the movie weren't trying (pathetically) to inspire people to be more generous, and appreciate what they have in life. For the same message, I'd rather watch Mr. Destiny, at least it has Michael Caine. Yeah, I said that."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),I'm sorry...,"My problem with this film is that it's 2 hr and 10 min length; I mean, I have no problem with other films that are this long, in fact, some of my favorite films are about 3 hr length, I just think this could have been resolved in a lot less time. My problem it's not for the film being of the 1940's; I completely understand how movies were made back then, so this is not a complaint about the acting or the effects at all, in fact, I think these two were done excellently. I just think the development of George's life could have been a little shorter, I mean, we know he's a good man and helps people, but what's the need to drag this out too much? I believe this is simply so that the ending has a greater impact, but unfortunately for me it has more weight that I liked the entire story than that I liked only the ending."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946),"Love it, except!!","We watch It's a Wonderful Life every year. It is a superb movie. The only thing that gets my goat is Potter never gets his comeuppance for keeping the $8000. I love the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I cry when Mr. Gower hits George on the ear. I know it was panned when it came out because it was supposedly against capitalism but I don't see it that way. I dislike Potter because he steals not because he's rich. The acting is great by everyone. I love the maid. We just never know the impact we have on other people's lives-for good, hopefully, not for the bad. I highly recommend the movie."
Ferrari (2023),Some flaws but still great,"I saw ""Ferrari"" last night. Adam Driver in the titular role and Penelope Cruz as his put-upon wife are fantastic. The rest of the cast is OK, but not great. Shailene Woodley appears to be miscast as Ferrari's mistress - she just doesn't cut it. The screenplay is good, but there are some characters who interact with Ferrari who I had trouble understanding who they were, and their accents made some of dialog hard to understand. The racing scenes were well filmed, and the cinematography was excellent. So, even with the faults I noted, I would still highly recommend the film for the acting tour-de-force by Driver and Cruz. 8/10."
Ferrari (2023),Shows the intriguing inner dealings of man through both his business ventures and his private life,"""Ferrari"" is a biographical drama film based on the biography ""Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine"" by Brock Yates. Directed by Michael Mann (""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Heat"", ""Collateral"") and starring Adam Driver, Penelope Cruz, and Shailene Woodley, it shows the intriguing inner dealings of man through both his business ventures and his private life. In 1957 in Italy, sports car manufacturing company Ferrari is facing major financial difficulties. While coping with this predicament, the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver), is also dealing with his own personal problems, with the recent death of his first son Dino, the deterioration of his marriage to his wife Laura (Penelope Cruz), and his double life with his mistress Lina (Shailene Woodley) and his second son Piero. As these issues grow further out of control, Enzo decides to gamble the entire company's future on entering his elite racing team into the Mille Miglia, a 1,000 mile summertime race that stretches around the roads of Italy. With the race fast approaching, Enzo works around the clock to get his team ready for the big day, all while trying to maintain stability within his private life. It is common knowledge that Ferrari often ranks high on the lists of companies that are generally well regarded by luxury sports car enthusiasts. Since their first line of road cars went into production in 1947, Ferraris have endured on in popularity even to this day, particularly due to their frequent participation in numerous notable racing events. The founder and namesake for this company was racing-driver-turned-businessman Enzo Ferrari, whose intense management decisions were what helped the company out of some early financial strife. The story of what took place during this time is told to us in Michael Mann's film ""Ferrari"", a stylised biopic that shows this man working tirelessly to keep his company afloat. The film's most notable strength is in the way in which it depicts Enzo Ferrari not as some perfect messianic hero but instead as a flawed human being with dubious morals. At the beginning, we see Enzo travelling to a cemetery to visit the tomb that holds his deceased young son Dino, who had only died a year earlier. While he mourns his child, we see Enzo make a promise to both Dino and himself to ensure the legacy of their family name enduring on for the longest time. Afterwards, we are shown that Enzo is living a double life; firstly with his marriage to Laura, who has grown to resent him due to her husband's failing business, and secondly his relationship with his mistress Lina, of which has produced another son, Piero. The film makes it clear that Enzo is not a morally sensible person, wishing to keep up the charade of a stable marriage while still maintaining an affair with a younger, more relatable woman. In most other cases, it would be hard to feel any sympathy for someone like Enzo, but as the film progresses we see that his behaviour has come about as the result of the unorthodox managerial practices he has created for his company. Desperate to save his brand from bankruptcy, Enzo resorts to more extreme methods of putting the company name on the map. With the Mille Miglia only six months away, Enzo enters his team of racers in this prestigious event, which requires them all to work harder than they have ever worked before. We watch as Enzo's racers are pushed to their limits, driving at top speed around custom made tracks, often putting themselves in danger of overshooting a corner and crashing. Without revealing too much here, there were a number of incidents that actually required some medical assistance for many of Enzo's unluckiest drivers. Yet despite these setbacks, Enzo remained determined to keep his drivers in the race, even if that meant some of them going home in a body bag. The interesting thing here is that none of these racers seem to complain about the dangerous working conditions and go along with their boss's wishes anyway. This appears to indicate that they have a huge amount of respect for Enzo's company and are even willing to risk their own lives to help it succeed. Under Michael Mann's direction, the dialogue scenes are handled with the reasonable amount of care, although things do tend to feel a bit soap opera-ish at times. For instance, there are a number of parts where we see Enzo and his wife Laura arguing over what direction he should be taking the company, whether it involves him doing his own thing or following her advice the whole time. Through this, we see why Enzo and Laura's marriage is failing, as they are often at each other's throats disagreeing over various things. Mann uses minimal lighting during these argument scenes, perhaps to show that their once happy marriage is a dark shadow of its former self. This is a common directorial trademark of Mann's films, as he has utilised this to his advantage in many of his previous works, like ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"". The problem here is that these scenes aren't featured enough in the story to leave their desired impression. I never felt like I properly understood why Enzo and Laura were often disagreeing with each other, aside from the usual sexist jabs at her being a woman. Another thing Michael Mann does well here is the way he shoots the racing scenes. Though they aren't as intense as your typical ""Fast and the Furious"" affair, they are still quite entertaining to watch. I enjoyed watching as each racer tried to pass the other in a more realistic fashion, as though they are actually trying to make it to the finish line in record time. There's also the added risk that a car could flip over and crash or overshoot a corner and fly off a cliff, especially with the less safe engineering available in that decade. What's interesting is that Mann appears to be conveying that Enzo is treating these races like they are a business decision rather than a pleasurable form of entertainment. In other words, what others perceive as fun is a more serious state of affairs to a hard-thinking entrepreneur like him. This is an unusual departure from your usual movie with fast car racing, but it nonetheless works in the film's favour. In the lead role, Adam Driver does a fine enough job as Enzo Ferrari, a man whose business life and private life did not balance out the way he may have hoped. He stands out primarily during the parts where he is trying to keep his secret affair with Lina away from his wife Laura. Driver's performance is never too intense nor is it too subdued, he shows just the right amount of emotion whenever it is needed of him. One scene where I thought this worked well was when he is talking to Lina about how much he fell in love with her, even though he is still married to Laura. Here, he reveals that although he already has a wife, Enzo's true love is for Lina and what his spouse cannot give him on an emotional level is what drives him to keep this affair going behind Laura's back. At his core, while Enzo is doing some morally terrible things that would cause most of us to dislike him, he is still a vulnerable human being with emotional desires that he wants fulfilled. However, I think Penelope Cruz steals the show in every scene she is in as Enzo's wife Laura. Each time she is on screen, Cruz seems to be an intimidating presence looming over Driver, as she plays Laura like a determined businesswoman, reluctant to blindly go along with her husband's ideas to save the company. In one scene, she displays a complete lack of fear by pointing a gun at her husband, which he ironically states he gave to her as a gift to protect herself from anything that can be considered dangerous. Though some of her dialogue was a bit repetitive, especially during the film's third act, Cruz definitely made the most of all the material given to her and outshone her co-star many times. I just wish the same could be said about Shailene Woodley as Enzo's mistress Lina, who does very little in the film other than look happy to see him and ponder how long he can keep her a secret from his wife. There aren't nearly enough moments of Enzo and Lina together that convinced me why he picked her over Laura. Sure, Lina is more mellow than Laura, but she doesn't seem to have any other emotional connection that would cause him to become attracted to her other than her physical appearance. Had the film delved deeper into Enzo and Lina's relationship, it could have made for a great love triangle with the backdrop of racing cars. Instead, it's a standard story about a failing business and failing marriage. Although it doesn't quite stick the landing in the way it could have, ""Ferrari"" still manages to provide some entertaining moments thanks to its lead cast and impressive directorial decisions. The performances of both Adam Driver and Penelope Cruz in addition to Michael Mann's direction during the racing scenes all make this film very watchable even during its weakest moments. I suppose the blame can be placed on Troy Kennedy Martin's subpar screenplay, who according to some research actually died in 2009, making this a posthumous release. Regardless, if you're enthusiastic about Ferrari and a brief history of their initial hardships, then this film may be worth at least one viewing. I rate it 7/10."
Ferrari (2023),Ferrari pipped at the post,"This film is beautifully shot and set, giving us a nostalgic view of 1950s Italy. The editing seems to have slowed the pace of the story whilst some of the early dialogue is awkwardly succinct. The car scenes are very nicely done but sometimes seem choppy, mere glimpses of the action as if just caught out the corner of your eye. Driver is good as Ferrari, cool and distant. Cruz is great as a manic, heartbroken woman. The relationship between Ferrari and his women could have been developed more. The drivers were window dressing with very little opportunity for us to empathise with, quite superficial. Clearly a lot of effort went into getting detail right but at the expense perhaps of character development. This film left me feeling that it could have been a lot better, especially if earlier scenes were re-edited."
Ferrari (2023),Vroom with a view,"Even if he didn't have the perfect name for the job, after seeing ""Ferrari"" it's hard to picture anyone other than Adam Driver starring in it. This despite the fact he's 20 years younger than Italian automotive icon Enzo Ferrari was during the film's 1957 time frame. After being part of ""The House of Gucci"" ensemble, Driver had the accent down. He just had to dye his hair gray and add some prosthetics to more closely resemble the former race driver now struggling to keep his storied company afloat. Disregard the contrived brouhaha that the role should have gone to an Italian actor - Driver nails it. The studio is billing this as a mix of ""Grand Prix"" and ""The Godfather,"" thanks to its gorgeously recreated Italian settings. Race tracks. Colorful villages. The streets of Rome. Dimly lit opulent interiors. It's Vroom with a View. The venerable Michael Mann, who pioneered using automobiles as co-stars with the human actors in ""Miami Vice,"" is a natural to direct. He has a whole toy box to play with in the voluptuously sculpted, ridiculously loud and powerful fleet of red racing machines embossed with the Ferrari stallion emblem. In their leather jackets, cigarette in one hand, blond magazine cover girl on the other arm, the drivers - including Patrick Dempsey as Piero Taruffi - were the rock stars of the era on tracks across Europe. But in Italy, Enzo Ferrari towered above them major domo style, alpha to the max, ramrod straight, always impeccably dressed in suit and tie, every gray hair in place above his signature sunglasses. Racing, it turns out, was less daunting than keeping the company books in the black. That job fell to his fiery wife and partner Laura (Penélope Cruz). She managed the business side of the factory whose client list favored wealthy playboys and Middle Eastern sheiks. As opposed to rivals like Jaguar, for whom racing was good for selling cars, the Ferrari factory sold (a lot less) cars in order to support Enzo's lethal addiction, the passion for speed and checkered-flag victory. Unfortunately for volatile Laura who keeps a pistol in her nightstand, when Enzo's heart isn't at the track, it's in the villa he provides for Lina (Shailene Woodley), the ""other woman"" he adores, along with their son Piero. The Ferraris' marriage is as combustible as the cars precipitously fueled with huge funnels in the pit stops. Passions are most inflamed - and Driver and Cruz's performances at their best - when they're fighting. Most of the excitement though, comes from the cars, especially in the grueling 1,000-mile Mille Miglia road race across Italy. The late Brock Yates - legendary in automotive culture for decades - co-wrote the script before he died in 2016. Director Mann shares Enzo Ferrari's obsession with every detail of these miraculous machines, putting us in the cockpit in one second, sending us soaring high above the undulating roadways in the next, turning it all into visual poetry. ""Ferrari"" takes its place this awards season in a crowded field of mid-20th-Century period pieces, several of them about sports. Time is not necessarily on their side. The events they depict are too close to be historical, but feel dated and quaint in today's world. For all the mechanical sex appeal Ferraris conjured in the '50s, the cars on-screen - not to mention the Alfa Romeo and Fiat sedans the characters drive away from the track - look slightly cartoony in 2024. When Francis Ford Coppola created the ""Godfather"" trilogy, it was a seminal, organic process. The images, moods and textures came from a place deep in his soul to spring to life cinematically. The movie screen was his Sistine Chapel ceiling on which to paint his masterpiece. Imitation may be a form of flattery and homage, but borrowing so much ""Godfather"" imagery and screen craft - opera on the music track, cuts back and forth from Catholic ritual to real-world dangers - inadvertently creates a race in which ""Ferrari"" comes in second. ""Ferrari"" has the added burden of being about real people - granted, larger-than-life members of a dynasty rather than a mere family. ""The House of Gucci"" met a similar challenge with operatic, over-the-top strokes, painting its characters as clowns and buffoons when warranted. Aside from Enzo 's sardonic one-liners, ""Ferrari"" doesn't have much of a sense of humor. Enzo wasn't an amoral godfather, but wasn't a particularly likable guy, either. He was just a captain of industry who never outgrew a boyish delight in going fast, engaged in a sport
where victory comes at a high price indeed."
Ferrari (2023),Worth The Pitstop!,"© By Katherine De Vere
Adam Driver takes the lead as Enzo Ferrari, the founder of this famous racing dynasty, who delivers some corking lines, ""...dwelling in the perpetual twilight of failure,"" being one. The quirky one-liners are a key strength of the movie, and a credit to writer, Troy Kennedy Martin. Expect some laugh out loud moments! Set in 1957, with all the glamour and pizzazz of Formula One; it's a crises time for Ferrari. It's win or lose-all in the now-banned, treacherous 1,000-mile race through Italy, the Mille Miglia. No spoilers here, but be prepared to grip your seats! There's much to like about this film which is delivered with a sensitive touch. One scene, set at the opera shows the interplay between the character's memories (as flashbacks,) and their emotional response to the beautiful music; it's masterfully done. Even non-racing fans can thrill to the red, shiny, zoom and break-neck speeds presented. Caps off to cinematographer, Erik Messerschmidt, for capturing the eye-popping, engine- roaring glory of racing car-zip. Expect a change in pace, too, because the film includes some breath-taking landscape photography. Penelope Cruz (Laura Ferrari,) is an engagingly grumpy addition to the cast, and the gun-scene at the family home is just delightful. Cruz as Enzo's wife delivers her role with gleam- in-the-eye gusto which you entertained the whole way through, ditto Ferrari's grandmother, played by Daniela Piperno. Jack O' Connell gets a shout out as English driver Peter Collins, as well as Patrick Dempsey (McDreamy, Gray's Anatomy, ) as the 'silver fox' champion, Taruffi. Dempsey races in real life, which gives his portrayal the edge. As the aristocratic, outrageous, Alfonso de Portega, actor Gabrielle Leone's portrayal falls flat. Yes! He's good-looking but more screen charisma was needed to lift a role that could have been sublime. (An opportunity missed?)
Overall, Veteran director Michael Mann's experience tells. He delivers a stylish and witty film that isn't too garish or 'Hollywood'. It may be that there is something at the heart of the film that falls slightly shy off the mark in terms of emotional impact: Is it in the writing? The character of Enzo? A few scenes that needed re-working? However, there is enough here to say that this is a good film and well worth your time. In racing, as in life, isn't that what counts? Rating: Worth the pitstop, green flags all the way."
Ferrari (2023),"Good character study, not much else","This is an interesting character study of Enzo Ferrari, you see the man and his struggles with both his business and his personal life. It is well acted and produced, not every performance is perfect, but still a solid movie. The problem I have is the story... there really isn't one. It tells of the events around the breakup with his family(s), his failing business, and his desire to win auto races. However, none of these actually come to any real conclusion in the movie, which leads to a disjointed story and unsatisfying conclusion. A good script usually involves the main character changing, learning, and evolving... not so in this case. The Ferrari at the end of this movie is exactly the same person as he was at the start. Lots of things happen... but nothing none of those happening seem to really impact the main character and drive him forward. I think if the script had focused more on one or two of these story lines, and followed them from beginning to end, it would have been a better movie. For example, the movie spends a significant time on if Enzo will accept his illegitimate son as his heir, but the movie just ends with the note ""Pietro became an engineer at Ferrari."" It felt rushed, like the writers didn't know how to convey this in the actual movie. The same with the climactic car crash, the negotiations with Fiat to save the business, etc. I honestly was surprised at how they left so much unresolved when the end credits started to roll."
Ferrari (2023),Ferrari Style Without Ferrari Horsepower,"The Year of the Biopic continues. With Big names Oppenheimer and Napoleon already taking up spots among the best films of the year, Michael Mann throws his one-name biographical picture into the ring with Ferrari. It's Adam Driver's turn in the driver's seat, so to speak, as Enzo Ferrari, the pioneering Italian sports car craftsman and Don Giovanni. The film, a dutiful character piece, entertains without finding real power in the man. Ferrari does not bite off more than it can chew with its screenplay, based on the book Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine. We see a glimpse of Enzo, his relationship with wife and business partner Laura, played by Penélope Cruz in a performance that will get her serious attention this Oscar season, his passion for the craft of auto racing, and his double life that sees him with two sons, one dead and one illegitimate. These points of drama are structured around one event, the 1957 Mille Miglia, rather than an entire life. For a figure like Enzo Ferrari, the snapshot approach is the right one. Enzo doesn't have the mythic status to support an epic biography that spans a full life. This script by Troy Kennedy Martin is a workmanlike condensation of several Mannian themes: masculinity, professionalism, vibes. It's the sort of clean, intelligent script that does what it should without veering too far away from the proven formula. I could end my review right there, as a matter of fact. Because that dutiful workmanship is the takeaway from all of Ferrari. It's not that there aren't highlights that make the film worth your time. Adam Driver does give a seriously watchable performance, as does the aforementioned Cruz. Their scenes together are some of the most electric in a movie heavily loaded with powerhouse racing sequences. And those sequences are, at times, spectacular. Gearheads need not fear that Mann has forgotten that element. There is a lot of real beauty to these machines and the landscapes they drive through that Mann is able to coax out. It doesn't mean, however, that this is a technical achievement anywhere near the level of John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix-the Holy Grail of racing pictures. Ferrari is, at its best, a very slick biographical entertainment. We learn about Enzo Ferrari, his personal and professional life, the art of auto racing, and we're suitably entertained while we do. There is nothing altogether bad about Ferrari, if you can look past Shailene Woodley's dreadful attempt at an Italian accent, and there is some power to the picture, some lasting imagery. But Michael Mann never delivers more than a solid, reliable piece of machinery. A Toyota more than a Ferrari. 76/100."
Ferrari (2023),A Snapshot of a Life,"A tale of drama, tragedy and danger at high speed, ""Ferrari"" is a glimpse at a time in Enzo Ferrari's life where his personal and professional life were in turmoil what with infidelity, business troubles and deaths plaguing his dreams of racing glory. Based on the book ""Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine"" by Brock Yates the film takes on the challenges faced by the icon as he navigates his perilous course through destiny. Adam Driver stars as the racing legend portraying him as a tall and gangly poker-faced boss kowtowed by his women and who encourages and disparages his people in turn. Penélope Cruz plays his tough, no nonsense wife who milks her long suffering relationship with her husband for all its difficult worth. Shailene Woodley is his patient and dutiful mistress while a cast of reporters, racers and celebrities pay court to the legend. While no classic and nothing particularly outstanding the movie is a fascinating look at the world of big business, the racing industry and the life and mind of a man living at a pinnacle of power. Founder of one of the most popular and most revered automobiles in history, Enzo Ferrari is one of the most interesting personalities in history and ""Ferrari"" gives a good idea why. This is a fine, simple and direct film that every racing enthusiast and film fan wouldn't mind seeing."
Ferrari (2023),Unmoved,"For a movie about a legendary name in motor sports, I was expecting something at least on the order of Gran Turismo in terms of heart-pounding spectacular special effects of racing drama, or a feel-good movie about an underdog overcoming-all-odds to come up on top, or at least a nobility-of-failure movie about personal tragedy dooming a admirable passions project. I got none of those. Instead, I walked out confused as to why, if Italians (portrayed in the movie) talk in English, watch TV in English, listen to radio in English, would they sing in Italian. I have always enjoyed Adam Driver, Penelope Cruz, and especially Shilene Woodley. They are fine here and did nothing special to really move me. I just wish that they learn how to choose better roles."
Ferrari (2023),Not enough material,"-Good acting
-Interesting casting choices I would not have made. -Story was lacking. Not enough material to make a good story. Kind of flat... not a lot highs and lows. -Crash scene was gratuitous. The showing of body parts to prove the dangers of racing should've been happened sooner rather than the end. No where does the film elude to this kind of graphic morbid detail... it's shocking and not in a good way. Wreckless with audience members. -The tension between Ferrari winning or losing was never achieved... Maserati seemed like an after thought. The stakes were high but never got that sense from the script. -A film told through Laura's (Penelope's) POV would've been much more interesting. She held the marriage card, the money card, and the Italian honor card."
The Colour Purple (2023),Spectacular,"I have not read the book, seen the original movie or the stage production of The Color Purple. I came into this completely not knowing what to expect. So I cannot compare it to anything that came before but all I know is I loved it. I tend to hate many ""musicals as movies"" so I was skeptical. But I loved the songs. Loved the storyline. But what really made it work for me what the actors. There were many times I felt very emotional during this movie because the actors just pull you in with their stories and wit and humor. It was quite a ride but I enjoyed every moment. The only thing I will say is during the last song, that food was sitting there getting cold."
The Colour Purple (2023),Wonderful,"This cast deserves all the awards, ovations, and praise. Everyone played their parts beautifully and wonderfully. The performances and how good they were can't be overstated. Fantasia is amazing, Danielle steals every scene she's in, Taraji is such a star, Halle Bailey is perfect as well. I would have loved more Corey Hawkins, but what we got of him was great, too. This script and the way it was brought to life were really great. It was perhaps a bit too long and it took me maybe 10-15 minutes in the beginning to really get into the style of the film, but once I was in I was all in. Emotional and captivating, highly recommend."
The Colour Purple (2023),Entertaining adaptation of the stage musical,"Blitz Bazawule's entertaining if uneven adaptation of the Broadway musical version of Alice Walker's novel - by way of Steven Spielberg's stodgy earlier film (he exec Produces). The cast is well chosen, particularly its leads - Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo and Fantasia Barrino as Celie who bring a verisimilitude to it. As fine as the cast in Spielberg's edition was, that film never felt authentic. Marcus Gardley's screenplay does a decent job condensing the long timeline, but it's still a bit choppy. The saving graces are the exuberant performances and the music and staging. The emotional beats mostly connect and it has a lovely ending."
The Colour Purple (2023),Spectacular!,"I was so moved by this beautiful adaptation of the novel. I had never seen the stage play, so I did not know what to expect. I have not been moved by a musical since first seeing Hamilton. Fantasia Barino, Danielle Brooks, Taraji P. Henson, Coleman Domingo, and maybe even sweet Hailee Bailey ALL need to be nominated and win multiple awards. I also thought that it would me more of a movie for women, however, I was pleasantly surprised that it is a movie for men, as well. Bring your tissues, because you're going need them. I will return to the theater to see it again. I've already downloaded the soundtrack."
The Colour Purple (2023),If you haven't seen the stage musical you'll probably love it.,"I love this musical. I saw the original production on Broadway twice and the revival three times. In my eyes it is close to a perfect musical. It flows well, The music is fantastic, and the script is pretty strong. So I will be honest. I went into this movie pretty hesitant and would be hard to beat the stage productions for me. That being said. My problem wasn't the cast or the direction. It was what they did to the original material. They cut 14 songs from the show and replaced them with songs to feature the smaller roles. They cut a pivotal scene before ""I'm Here"" that gives that song so much more depth and feeling. The struggle they cut from the stage version was missing a little. Don't get my wrong. There was still struggle obviously. But the relationship between Shug and Celie was much deeper. Shug actually leaves Celie for the piano player. Leaving her devastated in the middle of her happy moment of having success with her shop and learning her family is alive. It seemed in this version she got everything she wanted in life. Which is nice, but not how life is. The whole point of the song is she is broken yet again, but still here. Instead she gets an apology from Mister. The only story they started true to was Sophia. And that's why she's getting rave reviews and probably an Oscar nomination. They cut a duet of her and Harpo, but that song was a comedic filler. But otherwise the story kept the most rounded depth to the character. It's a good movie. But as a fan of the source material (not the book or the original movie, but the stage musical), I left liking it, but I didn't love it. And the people who were with me didn't see the stage show and loved it. It just lacked something. I really wanted it to be one of those movie musicals I return to over and over, but once was enough. If it's playing on TV I might stop and watch. But it's not something I'm going to seek out to watch."
The Colour Purple (2023),Another movie that should not be redone,"I never watched any iteration of The Color Purple and I am younger that the original. There was good messages here. ""Leave if your partner hits you..."" The targeted demographic of this movie amongst everyone else needs to see these messages. But it was so frustrating watching the same abuse play out on screen. Of course, I've been told that was common at that time and this is a remake, but I wish it took a more modern take. The theme of ""struggle love"" was very present especially towards the end when Celie is meant to ""forgive"" mister for his decades of abuse because he found ""god."" I wish they showed more of her strife to financial independence with the shop instead of just her strife in familial/platonic relationships. Likewise, the aspect of religion was not fleshed out or wanted in this age. I wanted Celie to take credit for improving her own life instead of crediting a god she's been told to believe in. The film much more ""modern"" which threw me off from the time period. The singing was strong of course if you like musicals."
The Colour Purple (2023),"""A"" For Effort","This entire project felt like they just wanted to log in a musical version of Alice Walker's book so that they can have it archived with the original 1985 version. It feels a bit hollow having had a little distance from it. I think it may be the singing and dancing. For those who don't know, the story starts in 1909 and is of two sisters Celie (Phylicia Pearl Mpasi
when young - Fantasia when older) and Nettie (Halle Bailey when young - Ciara when older) who are raised by a Father. They get separated when Dad offers up Celie to a man named Mister (Colman Domingo) a landowner, who inherited it. Mister is a horrific man. Slaps Celie around to take care of his kids (from other mothers). And sexually assaults her at night. This goes on for a few years. Celie eventually grows up and takes on the form of Fantasia. Years have took the life out her. Enter Shug Avery (Taraj P. Henson). A former mistress of Mister. The dynamics between her and Mister and Mister and Celie are clear. Shug is a singer who lives life to the fullest. And controls Mister through her sexuality. Shug and Celie become close friends. Taraji is having a great time in this role. She is flamboyant and excited to introduce the world to Celie. The story is fairly straightforward from this point. Celie learns what individuality and freedom means. And discovers inner strength in the face of trauma. All great messages. The issue of the singing and dancing. Okay, the movie also is about rape and incest. Celie's Father has been raping her repeatedly, which yields babies he gives away. This is soul crushing events that aren't brushed away by a tune. Or good choreography. On a stage, I can see the value. On screen, it feels very uneasy. Also, the case of Mister. Who is also an assaulter of women. His atonement comes very late in the movie. I can see for the interest of time you couldn't show the entire events of his ability to find Nettie and go through all the struggles to ""make it up"" to Celie. A little patched up for the interest of the story. It's not a dealbreaker since Domingo plays the role so well, you do believe his change of heart (though brought on by what he believes is a curse). I am leaving out a lot of good stuff. Danielle Brooks as Sofia is bound to get an Oscar nom. As if Fantasia. Her evolution of Celie doesn't necessarily feel the same as Whoopie's version. Somehow, the 1985 version feels more...mature. This felt like a high school musical. Still worth a look."
The Colour Purple (2023),Not Your Mother's Color Purple but You Will Love It Just the Same,"Like I said in the title, this is not your mother's 'Color Purple'. The reimagined film takes adaptations from the play with great visuals and songs to accompany it. Oh and the songs, they the perfect length - they get you moving but don't overstay their welcome. Disclaimer, I love the original 1985 film adaptation from Quincy Jones and Steven Spielberg. In that film you feel the characters and their sorrows which makes the ending all the more sweet! In this version there is more depth to the characters, it is not a bitter and there seems to be more understanding or forgiveness. Now there are many things I enjoy in the original screenplay much better but this film does do somethings to freshen the characters and perhaps even portrays them better. The Sophia and Harpo story is much better told here. Sofia's made a bigger character as she faces so many ups and downs. For my money Danielle Brooks steals the movie with her interpretation of Sofia! The second thing that really shined for me is the reimagined relationship between Celie and Shug, in the original movie it was done with much more undertone and Mister seemed not to notice but you will have to see how different this film portrays it and if you're like me you will think it was done justice. The final big thing I thought this film did better than the original was the portrayal of Mister. Mister is a deeper character here and perhaps you understand what life events have shaped him into the character he is, why he did the things he had and his continued evolution. Ultimately you will still leave the theater happy to visit the characters you know and be uplifted in retelling of their story with some lines you recognize and others you will be wanting to quote tomorrow."
The Colour Purple (2023),"Shut your brain off in regard to the original and watch with a fresh lens as a stand-alone, unique telling of the story","I watched The Color Purple (2023) in theaters with my daughter last night. The storyline revolves around two young ladies raised by a shop owner after their mother passes away. He sells off one of the sisters to be married, and she enters an abusive home where she loses her self-worth. She relies on kindness and memories of her sister as hope for a brighter future. Directed by Blitz Bazawule (The Burial of Kojo), the film stars Fantasia (The Butler), Taraji P. Henson (Hidden Figures), Danielle Brooks (Orange is the New Black), Colman Domingo (Selma), and Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton). This is a movie where you need to shut your brain off in regard to the original and watch with a fresh lens as a stand-alone, unique telling of the story. As a musical, the look, feel, and pace are entirely different. It resembles watching a play. The attire, settings, props, and depiction of the era are excellent, as is the casting. Fantasia delivers an outstanding performance, and Colman Domingo is remarkable as Mister. Taraji P. Henson, Hawkins, and Brooks provide great supporting performances. The beginning of the film is a bit clumsy and uneven-paced, with the segue between some scenes being better than others, but the second half is perfection. The grand entrance scene by Henson is legendary, as is a cameo during the birthing scene and the bar fight. Every reference to Africa and the flashes to those sequences is great too. The conclusion is triumphant and rewarding. In conclusion, this is an outstanding musical that's definitely a must-see. I would score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it."
The Colour Purple (2023),It's not a remake it's a reimagining..,"I just seen this movie and it was amazing, I enjoyed everything about this movie the songs were phenomenal and the acting was fantastic by everyone in the cast. The creative twist on.the original will leaves you with much open conversation to understand the importance of a film of this nature, it brings out many different emotions that one much feel that comes from different direction in the lives of each one of us once we open our minds and hearts to understand who we are and why we might be from birth to the development of our adult lives. Great presentation of music, dancing, acting, and singing. I loved every minute of the movie. You could feel the emotion throughout the theater . The audience cried and clapped. I rate this Film A+ a must see."
Parasite (2019),Simple Scenario,"""Parasite"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends genres to deliver a thought-provoking and socially relevant narrative. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable, crafting a visually stunning and emotionally charged film. The performances, particularly by the ensemble cast, are exceptional, capturing the nuances of class struggle with depth and authenticity. The film's dark humor adds a layer of complexity, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The meticulously designed sets and cinematography enhance the storytelling, creating a palpable atmosphere. ""Parasite"" challenges societal norms and explores the consequences of economic disparity in a compelling and unpredictable manner. It's a riveting exploration of the human condition that lingers in the mind, solidifying its place as a modern cinematic classic."
Parasite (2019),nice,"Its a nice movie.it showes the reality of two different world.korean movies and drams never disappoint always good entertainment. Definitely a MUST WATCH film from 2019, this Palme d'Or winner of Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint with it's hard hitting themes and exceptionally crafted story. Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going/Binge-watching such a joy. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic."
Parasite (2019),Phenomenal!,"'Parasite' (2019) is one of the most unique explorations of class I have ever seen. The South Korean setting really emphasizes the themes also, especially from a westerner's perspective like mine! Complementing these ideas portrayed, the editing and cinematography reinforces the extreme financial differences between the two families. The main house setting becomes almost like its own character within the film. It is modern but also has an undercurrent of isolation, which supports a reveal later in the narrative. All of the performances were phenomenal. As the tensions begin to rise, we can see the clear desperation of the main family. I do not think I could predict anything that was going to happen in the narrative past a certain point. Additionally, the ending of the film is one of the best I have seen in quite a while. Overall, I would highly recommend this Best Picture Winner! The tension builds throughout to an amazing finale, which is definitely worth seeing for yourself."
Parasite (2019),Would've been a perfect movie if it wasn't for...,"I absolutely loved this movie, the idea, the theme, acting was incredible. It was completely original, and you didn't see the twist coming. The story had a few loose ends that it tied up in the end. This would've been a perfect movie if it wasn't for the sex. If you're gonna put sex in movies, you need to have a good reason. This movie didn't have a good reason. That scene where the Kim family was hiding in the shadows while the Parks were on the couch watching their kid and engaging in sexual behavior, was not necessary, at least the sexual behavior was not necessary. This would've been a perfect movie without that. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like that content in movies and seeing that scene in this movie almost ruined it. This movie was one of a kind, it was so good, but that one scene with the Parks, did not need to happen. And that is why I rated 9/10."
Parasite (2019),A special film,"I have to give this movie lots of praise for it's cinematography, the brilliant editing, the fantastic performances from everyone, the themes are complex and delicious, deception, greed, power, ignorance and tragedy. The film is really well paced and holds your attention right from the start, it gradually builds and builds and things really do explode at the end. The film is about two parallel families one very rich the other literally living below the poverty line. It does make you wonder how such a skilled and cunning family could all actually be unemployed but that is what we open with. The film only really has a couple of locations but it never feels low budget and in some ways it's really stunning. The film know asks us to believe something that really stretches your credulity and this unfortunately becomes a very important plot point. Other little details don't quite feel right, such as a hyperactive boy sleeping until midday for his own party. The dialogue is fast but you can follow it with subtitles, my favourite scene though features no dialogue at all really but is rather a journey through a storm which is just beautiful the use of music and sparks and lights and water. Parasite is a dark comedy I think but the tone is a little bit all over the place, I laughed a lot but other parts don't seem to be comedic but pretty serious. The cast deserve special praise, every character is just perfectly portrayed. Whether or not you buy the ending is going to be up to the individual. I came out of the cinema pretty much floored by this film, but after another viewing some of the logical problems do start to niggle you. I appreciate this film though as something a bit special."
Parasite (2019),masterpiece,"What can I say... just Perfect! Enjoyed every aspect of this masterpiece by Bong Joon Ho. From the plot, directing, setting, cinematography, sound effects, and acting. This movie is clear, engaging, and keeps you thinking of what could happen next. Which is not what you ever expected. First, it starts out by laying out the foundation of the family, their financial situation and personalities. The apartment not even in ground floor. Later comes the Rock which is the curse and the blessing in my opinion. Gave them the opportunities and then chaos. Second the parallel, the other family, a community and class very different than theirs. From being jobless to them all employed in this house. They are servants in a family that is a naive high class family who clearly due to their financial situation, are very very naive. However, due to the financial gain, they try desperately not to lose their jobs. After that, their personalities change, especially as the father is disgusted by the upper class view and nativity. Every character at this point has his own views that changed. After that the hidden basement occurred and CHAOS!. The story doesn't just keep you hanging, the ending is amazing too. The climax which gets out of control and then the family reunites in the same house. Something I noticed which made me admire this movie is the directing and cinematography. Every single shot and angle is thought of, truly an art. All actors were exceptional. Especially the transform in their personalities. The music was astounding, it made me feel more engaged. This movie is nothing short than a masterpiece. Truly enjoyable."
Parasite (2019),"Masterpiece First Half, A TOTAL Letdown A Bit After That","A unique, compelling, perfectly acted, written and directed film almost to the very end. Really this story is so original and interestingly presented that I was amazed at how good cinema Asians can create. Unfortunately though, the climax and epilogue of Parasite (2019) was a total letdown and almost ruined my entire experience. I don't want to give anything away about what happens in the plot, so I'll be as discreet as possible. Watch it! Give it a chance. Maybe I'm being overly pretentious, but it seemed to me that the filmmakers were chasing some more epic and unexpected ending than the entire film was before that, and personally, everything that happens after the third quarter of the film is total insanity and nonsense. Final score: 5/10."
Parasite (2019),Unrealistic and Pitiful,"Let's start with what I saw first: 1. Self pity:
The whole family, full of adults at this point are sitting in their small, dirty, and cramped apartment begrudgingly and unhappy. What I have a problem with is the father, still healthy and able bodied was not really working hard to provide. Also the children, they were just as sloppy as their parents. Instead of working hard at trying to find a job, the mother wants to argue with her boys, almost losing the only job that's sustaining them for everyone! I mean they complain but honestly they ought to be kicking themselves! 2. Unrealistic:
Who in their right mind would fire their long time nanny/maid over one weekend they saw her sick without taking to her to see what's going on? I mean you're just asking for your life to just be subject to chance. These people are rich, getting money requires hard work to have a lot of it, you have to have a level of some intelligence. You can't make me believe a whole family could be this gullible! And why would you leave your oldest daughter in the room with a random guy? The details just did not add up to me, coming off as a movie that overlook the details just to make it to the climax as their selling point. This movie was rated higher than Hateful 8, one of my favorite movies, but totally are not on the same playing field, reading wise, I feel like this was a waste of my time. I and my husband both look forward to watching altleast one movie on our relaxing Sundays to get away from the life of busy toddlers and cleaning. What a total let down on movie Sunday 😞."
Parasite (2019),good,"The film had a strange atmosphere, and besides, events continued in a beautiful flow. Also, the symbolization on the smell in the movie was really great. A poor family could fix everything, make adjustments, and live a false life. But he couldn't get rid of that smell. It was the smell of the place where he lived. What they couldn't get rid of was this smell... The name of the movie could even be the smell, really! Because from my point of view, the most memorable part of the movie, that's what it was...
When I was reading reviews about the film before, I personally thought that this rich family would be broken up when I heard the concept of ""family falling apart"". They will defraud the family and pull them to their side, etc. But the family that really fell apart was both...
And there have been those who have said that there are no facial expressions for Koreans or something, I never agree with this. Because they are very special people who pass that feeling to us even with their eyes, their looks... The fact that they do not have obvious lines like us does not make them a failure in the acting sense. Korea is in a really great place in the TV and movie industry. I would also recommend other movies and TV series. It is especially useful to take a look at the Hong brothers' series. When I saw Park Seo Joon at the beginning of the movie, I thought it would continue in the movie, but then I saw that he wasn't in the movie anymore, but he was the one who started the events -albeit indirectly... Betrayal, fraud, rich-poor conflict, the most obvious and soft facts.. These were all the thoughts that lay at the heart of ""parasite""."
Parasite (2019),This film is engaging,"I have seen this film 2 times, and in the middle of the third. I was introduced to this film via an Alternative Cinema class for my University, otherwise I would probably have never seen this film. As the title states, this film is captivating from the very first scenes. I rather enjoy being drawn into a story by quick witted individuals and the family in Parasite are no exception. I will not go into the story as more professional writers than me have already done so. However, I will go into what I (a cinema fan) thought. The film is primarily driven by the plot. There is no need for violence (at least for a majority of the film) to keep you engaged. Each chapter in the film perfectly leads to the climax, allwhile being fed foreshadowing details that are revealed in the final act. Korean cinema is juxtaposed by American cinema, and we have to appreciate what they do differently, and better. If you want to have a good laugh, just sort this film's reviews by lowest rating first XD."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),"""That boat..., it's all I got.""","I don't know how worked up one can get over a sport like crew racing, but the picture does its best to instill some drama and excitement into a sport most would know very little about. The story takes place in 1936 as a prelude to that year's Olympic Games, for which the University of Washington is attempting to field a competitive team in order to take on the country's top rowers. Joel Edgarton stars as Coach Al Ulbrickson with the unenviable task of selecting and training a roster of brand-new recruits who don't quite yet know what they're in for in terms of the physical and mental stamina required to compete in the sport. Besides Ulbricskson, the story focuses primarily on one member of the newly selected crew. Callum Turner shows initiative and resolve as Joe Rantz, coming from an impoverished background that included abandonment by a father at the age of fourteen. Following a fairly standard formula for sports underdog stories, the team is shown coalescing around repeated practice runs and a camaraderie that extends beyond the waters they navigate as rowers. Interestingly, none of their competitions result in a loss, which seemed rather unusual to this viewer. Not that I wanted them to lose along the way, but it seemed like a stretch going up against much more experienced teams, especially since they formed what was actually a junior varsity squad at their school. It was amid much tumult coming from the university board that Ulbrickson decided that they would fare better than the school's varsity team, which for all intents and purposes, had no real participation in this story. What really surprised me in this film was mention of the Poughkeepsie Regatta as the premier racing event in the nation at the time. Having lived all my life in New York's Hudson Valley (I'm seventy three), I had never heard of it, so I had to do some research. Apparently, it was the major crew event in the U. S. from 1895 to 1949. In the early years Eastern schools like Cornell and Columbia dominated the race. The University of Washington actually became the first Western team to win the race in 1923. From that year on, Washington and the University of California dominated, consistently placing in the top three finishers. After 1950, the Intercollegiate Rowing association moved the event to various other locations. I've been unable to determine if the regatta is held on an annual basis following a one-time Poughkeepsie revival in 2008. The movie culminates with the 1936 Olympic Games, as members of the team welcome sprinter Jesse Owens during a pre-Games ceremony. Since this wasn't Owens's story, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler was only on hand long enough to express his frustration and disgust with the American win, undoubtedly a long shot once again in an unusual photo finish. The closing scene portrays the future aged Rantz expressing a sentiment to his own grandson when asked about participating in the legendary Olympic feat. In tribute to all of his teammates, he states - ""We were never eight. We were one."""
The Boys in the Boat (2023),There are not as many video games about rowboats . . .,", , , as there are about motor sports cars, so rowboat movies are few and far between. THE BOYS IN THE BOAT is about a rowing team called the ""Huskies."" Their rowboat is named the ""Husky Clipper."" If there's anything that sounds slower than a rowboat race, it's a dog race. Having people just along for the ride shouting ""Stroke, stroke, stroke"" or ""Mush, mush, mush"" strikes reasonable people as equally condescending if not abusive treatment of the animals doing the REAL work--the other boys in the boat, or the REAL huskies. But this is a great date flick, because there's nothing to miss until the swastikas unfurl. Plus the Fuhrer leaves the rowboat venue grumpier than a Longhorn football fan, so there's always a bright side for the Huskies in 2024."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),Outstanding,"I loved every solitary second of this movie. I loved the book, and I usually love the movie. But this movie transcended all of my hopeful expectations. I knew what was going to happen, but my heart still pounded like I didn't. Every actor slid into their role so seamlessly. I didn't miss what wasn't included. I was moved by how the story was told. I absolutely recommend taking anyone you love to see this movie. It is the anthem for anyone who has ever been down and out, or who has needed someone to believe in them. I could go on and on and on! I'm so thankful to all of those who put their heart and souls into making this movie a reality. It will inspire many!!!!!"
The Boys in the Boat (2023),VIEWS ON FILM review of The Boys in the Boat,"Last year I saw George Clooney's The Tender Bar. Now in 2024, I caught a showing of his new flick, The Boys in the Boat. George as a director, well he longs for the past, the wistful lightness of being. I mean just look at his directorial resume. That's right, ninety percent of his stuff takes place before the 1980s. Boys in the Boat has to do with the University of Washington rowing crew and their trek to the 1936 Summer Olympics. It's old-fashioned, blithesome stuff I tell you. At a running time of just over two hours, The Boys in the Boat is an epic sports journey, where nobodies gradually become somebodies and well, become Gold Medalists. Watching ""Boat"", I realized that this pic might be Clooney's Hoosiers, his underdog story to end all underdog stories. It's in the layers of development with the athletes, the way they had to beat other crews to reach the ultimate echelon, and the fact that their school wasn't the richest or uh, the biggest. Now is ""Boat's"" outcome all kinda predictable and feel-good formulaic? Somewhat. And does it not quite reach the emotional heights that Gene Hackman's 1986 vehicle did? Yeah, you could say that. Oh well. The propelling oar scenes (and there are many of them) have enough tension and agog to cause your heart to skip a beat. ""Everyone else tires and they just get stronger"". Indeed. Starring the likes of Callum Turner, Joel Edgerton, and Jack Mulhern, The Boys in the Boat is authentic and attested, putting the viewer in a time machine via the blow-softening period of The Great Depression. Clooney, well I've always liked the look of his films. With ""Boat"", he knows where to put the camera, he effectively shoots low to the ground, his visual palate is sunlit and nicely glossy, and he never seems to have to pander to lack of refinement to get his point across (hence the PG-13 rating). Strong ""stern""."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),It is like someone was reading you the book so well done,"The Boys in the boat is very good, well done because knowing how it is going to end before the movie start...could have made this film predictable ...but because of the setting, depression in the Pacific Northwest & because of the two lead actors...one is a rower, the other the coach, their presence on the screen is so magnetic that you want to know more of their story. The camera work is so good has to make you feel that you are on the water. No wonder the book regain popularity Un très bon et beau film...on sort du cinéma avec une impression d'avoir vu ...presque vécu quelque chose pas juste avoir été diverti."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),We really loved this movie!!!,"I have read some of the reviews here, and I don't agree with those who are picking this movie apart. It is a great movie! I was, surprisingly, moved to tears 4 different times...and that is something I rarely ever do. The story is amazing, and true. The guys are gorgeous! The women are gorgeous! The acting is amazing! George Clooney did an amazing job of capturing the look and feel of the 1930..the cinematography is great. We both thought the costumes were spot on, the music was really well done and matched the movie. You just really felt for the them, the boys themselves, the coaches, everyone. See the movie....feel good...enjoy the great acting and all those beautiful actors. Feel good about the USA, too. Great job, George."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),Not the book but not bad either,"For anyone who read and loved the book, this might be a bit disappointing. If you knew nothing of this true tale, you actually may be in for a treat. This is not about special effects or superhuman skills: this is true story about how 8 working-class college boys who had nothing but grit and determination, won Olympic gold in the 1936 Berlin games together with their tough, nail-eating coaches who refused to sugar coat anything for them. As any movie does, it short changes the details that lie in the heart of foundation of this wonderful historic tale, and as someone who loved this book (especially the audiobook), I was sad to see all those details that made the book a stand out missing. But how much CAN YOU cram into a 2 hour movie? Here's the thing though: it's a wonderful movie. Good direction, good cinematography, solid acting, decent script. I'll watch this movie any day over anything else playing in the theater right now. The competition scenes alone makes this a big-screen movie watching must: as in you are NOT going to get the same effects in your living room, I don't care what kind of sound system you've got or how big your television is. For what it's worth, it's worth your $13 to watch this in the theater."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),Formulaic Olympic Rowing Saga Pales in Comparison to Prior Academy Best Picture Award Winner,"George Clooney's latest film invites an unflattering but inevitable comparison to the Academy Award-winning Chariots of Fire. Both films revolve around underdogs making a splash at the Olympics, one set in the 1936 Games and the other in 1924. The glaring issue with both narratives, however, lies in their fixation on what can only be described as sporting footnotes-events that are, at best, ephemeral. Both films, despite their attempts to immortalize long-forgotten athletes, unwittingly serve as vessels for the self-glorification of numerous vested interests. Successful Olympic participants become pawns, elevating the prestige and recognition of universities or nations. Institutions seeking to enhance their reputation eagerly lap up the exposure, and herein lies the inherent problem. Chariots of Fire at least managed to infuse gravitas into its narrative by delving into the protagonist's struggle against antisemitism. In contrast, The Boys in the Boat falters in developing the backstory of its main character, Joe Rantz (played by Callum Turner). The Depression-era tale of a teenager cast aside by his family and forced to fend for himself remains underdeveloped and perfunctory. While Chariots of Fire focused on the relatively unexciting sport of running, The Boys in the Boat attempts to find drama in competitive crew rowing-an endeavor that proves to be even less compelling. The repetitiveness of rowing events becomes painfully evident after the initial display, despite the boys facing increasingly superior competition. Screenwriter Mark L. Smith seems at a loss with the film's two main female characters-Joe's girlfriend and the coach's wife-both relegated to the uninspiring roles of glorified cheerleaders. Coach Al Ulrickson (played by Joel Edgerton) does little to redeem the situation, as his character is reduced to scenes of stopwatch-checking, with the only dramatic moment arising from pushback against his controversial decision to send the junior varsity team to the Olympics instead of the seniors. Beyond Joe Rantz, the film neglects to provide meaningful insights into the rest of the team. The feeble attempt at drama involving one of the boys falling ill before a crucial Olympic event lacks impact, as the predictable outcome dilutes any tension. Clooney misses a chance to explore the depth of Rantz's horror at the rampant antisemitism in Berlin, with his walk around Berlin as depicted in the source material. Instead, the film resorts to the expected scene of Hitler's disappointment as the German team loses in a photo finish. The potential tension surrounding Rantz's rumored threat to leave the team before the Olympics appears to be strategically crafted to introduce the somewhat predictable wisdom of a mentor figure-the elderly designer of the boat used in the race. In contrast to the memorable musical score by Vangelis in Chariots of Fire, Alexandre Desplat's work in The Boys in the Boat feels generic, especially in the rowing scenes. For those who, like me, fail to discern the glory in ephemeral Olympic competitions, the question arises: are these victories worthy of entire feature films? A documentary might have delivered a more effective narrative. Nevertheless, if a feature film was the chosen medium, The Boys in the Boat proves to be a formulaic and uninspired exercise-one unworthy of cinematic endeavor."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),Solid FiLm,"This is a solid film from George Clooney and his team. Great storytelling, well written, edited and told beautifully, and well directed. Glad I saw it in the theater. The story will bring you to tears in the best way through amazing character journeys and lush patriotism. It's a period piece that doesn't shy away from the reality of the time. It helps paint a picture of classism and disparities of the century and sport. This film showcases the sport of rowing well including the commitment, strategy, and sheer will to win. As a former crewman, this story was told through the eyes of those who love the sport. It was that passion that came through the screen. I loved this film and will be recommending it to others. Go Huskies and Team USA."
The Boys in the Boat (2023),Elegant visual work!! Very engaging.,"The audience applauded at the end of the movie -- that's rare for where we're located. Cinematography is beautiful. Felt like we were there. The director, crew and writers did a great job making this. Movies are off-spring of the books. As a novelist & more, I understand the hard work of doing the transition to visual storytelling. The visual story is different from the book. Graphic Novels are not the same as a source book or movie. .... ..... .... Back to BOYS IN THE BOAT. This is a film you can watch again with other family members. You'll see something you didn't see the first time. The effort to transport us back to 1930's America succeeded stupendously. Please simply add an elegantly scripted sentence at the end of the film. ""If you liked the movie read or listen to the novel""."
Scrooged (1988),In my top 10 Christmas movies to watch every year!,"This movie never gets old for me! The TV puns are witty playing off the timeless classic and modernize it to fit the cut throat TV industry, and a desensitized generation. Bill Murray is at his best with his zany SNL throwbacks, impressions and being funny the way he used to be (although I haven't seen him in ages.) The ghosts of past & present (Carol Kane) & Bob Cathwaite are hilarious. Other role players including John Forsythe and Robert Mitchum provide good characterization. This movie is 35 years old and it never gets old as my family and I can recite the lines in this film verbatim and laugh every time."
Scrooged (1988),Forgotten Christmas Classic,"This is, for me, one of Bill Murray's best performances, even though it is unhinged. He plays a network executive who is clearly unhappy with the choices he has made, and through the magic of Christmas he is visited by three ghosts like in a Christmas Carol. It is a retelling of it, but one that is more modern, and still firm set in the greed is good era of the 1980s. This film came out when I was eleven, and I think my parents picked up a VHS copy shortly after. I wanted to watch a Christmas movie with my kids, and they didn't want to watch Gremlins for some reason, so I chose this one. I remember every little detail, and the practical effects are amazing. The rotting corpse whose arm gets torn off is still creepy today. It's a pretty dark Christmas film, which leads to me to wonder why were the films of my childhood a bit dark, and now films for children are so antiseptic?"
Scrooged (1988),"Has it's moments, but overall falls flat","The movie starts off decent but then falls apart at about the halfway mark. I think a modern day revamp. (for the 80's) was a great idea, and kudos with Scrooge being a ruthless, disconnected TV exec, but there was just so much more left to be desired in this version of the classic Dicken's tale. As the film goes on, it just starts to become nonsense and many scenes are just loud and irritating. The ghost of Christmas present was downright terrible and completely unfunny. I had a bit of difficulty following the film as it was all over the place and it felt like it's was just jumping from scene to scene without any direction. The biggest issue was that, for a rendition of A Christmas Carol, it lacked heart. The ending felt rushed and disjointed and seeing Scrooge's redemption, which is my favorite part of the story, was so unsatisfying. All in all, the movie is mostly unfunny, annoying, dull, and rather simple minded. It also lacks that emotion other versions really captured with this story. If you're considering watching it, I say give this one a pass."
Scrooged (1988),Best Christmas Movie Ever!,"Bill Murray is hilarious as this modern version of Ebeneezer Scrooge. The whole movie is comic genius from start to finish. And while you would think that the spirit of xmas would be lost with this approach, the movie remains nostalgic and really brings the feel good factor that is required in a xmas movie. The supporting cast are also fantastic with Bobcat Goldthwait delivering a brilliant and again hilarious performance. The Movie is defo of the era with similarities to other Bill Murray Classics such as groundhog day. By far my favourite Xmas movie and a real treat for all the family. I am very much a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas Entertainment, but if you want something that is a bit leftfield but still makes you come back for that xmas hit , year after year. You can't go wrong with Scrooged."
Scrooged (1988),"Hilarious 80s update of ""A Christmas Carol""","""Scrooged"" is one of the most hilarious Christmas films ever made but it's surprisingly controversial or at least unpopular among some fans of Christmas movies. Maybe it's expectations. For those who say it's not a literal version of Dickens' story, well, it's not. It's inspired and loosely based on it. Many people complain that the character is too dark or that they can't like him enough to root for him. But this is not ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and Bill Murray isn't Jimmy Stewart. I don't think anyone watching any of the actual films of ""A Christmas Carol"" or even reading the story would say they could relate to Scrooge or see any hope for him.. When asked to help the poor by charity workers, he answers ""If they would rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population."" Scrooge is a dark character, so far it would seem from any hope of redemption that when it comes it's all the more joyful. Secondly, ""Scrooged"" is basically a farce and so by its very nature everything is exaggerated. That's how a farce works. If Bill Murray's character had been a mildly grumpy man it would have fallen flat. Everything is exaggerated to its maximum effect. Bill Murray's Frank Cross isn't bad, he's horrible. As the movie begins he does something awful, then he does something even worse, then he tops even that, totally plumbing the depths of being an unprincipled scoundrel. There's seemingly no limit to how awful Frank Cross can be. Murray's deadpan delivery and general air of condescension embody the character perfectly. He plays it beautifully, too: no winks at the camera, just totally straight as the boss from hell. It's his film, he had to carry it and he did. The film was directed by action movie director Richard Donner between ""Lethal Weapon I and II. The production became well known for its general air of disagreement between Donner, Murray and screenwriters Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue. Each seemed to have their own idea of the film, with the writers saying Donner did not know how to shoot comedy and not liking Murray's improvisations, which included the major speech he gives at the end. Donner thought Murray was difficult but admired his professionalism. Murray had not made a picture since ""Ghostbusters: four years earlier and felt stressed by the pressure to carry the film. He also suffered some physical reactions to the artificial snow, but this might have actually improved his portrayal of Cross..Somehow it all worked out. It's a bit long here and there and Fran;s change of heart seems a bit too sudden, but that's what the story is about. The film knocks you out of any preconceived expectations by opening with Donner satirizing himself with an armed invasion of Santa's Workshop at the North Pole (""The Day the Reindeer Died"":). It features an actual action star, then goes off in several other unexpected directions until you don't know what will happen next and that's the general way the whole film is. It's also loaded with unexpected casting and surprise cameos which are all part of the fun. Some of this may have lost some effect as time has gone by and new viewers may not understand some of the references, but it's still a funny film even if you don't know who all the actors are. It also satirizes the notion that any publicity is good publicity, the industry obsession with awards and the quest for network ratings. The supporting cast is excellent, even Murray's own younger brother playing Frank Cross's younger brother James. The film was a hit in 1988, though not a huge hit. Over subsequent decades it has picked up many fans and is now a holiday classic."
Scrooged (1988),Nice little spin,"Coolest thing about this film is how it spins the Christmas carol formula. With hundreds of different Christmas carol films always taking place in the same time period just with different actors or different characters. This movie brings life by making it very modern, at least for the late 80s. Bill Murray plays a film producer working on a Christmas carol film whose life mirrors Scrooge. The ghosts in this film are hilarious and have some of the best scenes, the new plot twists and threads are interesting although feel slightly unrealistic, although considering how slapstick this film is that shouldn't really be a problem. My biggest gripe with this film is I just didn't find it funny, it had all the perfect jokes to be funny but nothing overly made me laugh out loud, bill Murray also shouts a whole lot for some reason. With that being said this is still a very good Christmas classic and an awesome take on a Christmas carol."
Scrooged (1988),Meh,This was the most bill murray of bill murray of bill murray movies ever. Plays the same smarmy character he always plays. What you think of this movie depends on how much over the top bill murray-ing you can take. He really is a gross jerk. I feel like maybe he was playing himself. Like his old girlfriend would be so into him and immediately swoon the minute he pays attention to her (right after making out with a solid gold dancer on live tv - haha hilareous right?). It is so ridiculous. In the end he doesn't seem redeemed he just seems insane. Like seriously a mental breakdown right before he commits suicide. His assistent holds the studio at gunpoint (which def isn't funny anymore) while he makes a truly deranged speech while crying. It's more disturbing than sweet. Maybe that was the point. I'm not entirely sure. I guess I don't get it. Now I can cross it off my list. It's like how wes anderson has just got too wes anderson. This is the same. Just too much free reign bill murray. I chuckled a few times but not enough to make this any kind of classic.
Scrooged (1988),Kind of meh fever dream,"It's been on my watch list for a while now. Didn't like it much when I finally sat down to watch it. Bill Murray's character just screams all the time, that's it. I understand the Scrooge-character is supposed to be unlikable but Murray's character is unlikeable in an obnoxious sort of way that it makes it hard to believe he's redeemable. The movie as a whole is very over the top, but not in a good way. Half of the lines are unintelligible due to sound editing or the actors' delivery. It felt kind of like a fever dream. There were a couple good laughs but not good enough to make me watch it again."
Scrooged (1988),Scrooged (1988),"4/4: Scrooged (1988) (8/10): Here's a true gem, A Christmas Carol with a twist! Scrooged is a more contemporary retelling of the classic Scrooge tale. It follows, Frank, a selfish and cynical television executive who is not a fan of Christmas. He sends cheap gifts to his family and employees, airs the least Christmasy Christmas shows and movies during the holidays, fires his workers for saying that they should do something different and more wholesome for the holidays and even uses others misfortune to further himself. He is then one night nearing the holidays by the ghost of his former boss who was a legend in the business warning him that he needs to change and he will be visited by three ghosts. He is then sent down a spiral of insanity as the ghosts show him the error of his ways in order to change him from being Scrooged to a Saint. Bill Murray stars in this more modern and slightly darker version of the story and he is also joined by Bobcat Goldthwait in a more under appreciated yet very quirky holiday film. We have Richard Donner directing who was also behind The Omen, The Goonies and the Lethal Weapon movies and he is accompanied by legendary composer Danny Elfman who has worked with Tim Burton on several occasions as well as the Spider-Man Trilogy, Hellboy II, and more films. The Portrayal of Frank by Murray is great as he really shows his selfishness followed by his denial to accept that what he's experiencing is in fact real and then his mental breakdown once he fully realizes it is happening followed by him getting more and more cracked up after each encounter. Might I add that the ghosts are all fantastically designed, with my favourite overall being the ghost of Christmas Past as he has stereotypical New Yorker attitude coupled with a dry sense of humour but overall design is Ghost of Christmas Future even though we see the least of him, his screen time isn't wasted. When he is first seen and he is just taking up the various tv screens to form his face and then we see that huge skeletal hand reach out behind Frank, man that effect is so cool. The score is not one of Elfman's most notable but it's a nice little piece nonetheless. Overall the film is just the right kind of movie for the holiday season, this one is a much recommended watch."
Scrooged (1988),Wonderful comedic adaptation of the classic,"Charming, magical, funny and sweet. Great cast, costumes, writing. I watch it every Christmas! Carol Kane.as the ghost of Christmas present, played as a tough as nails, take no prisoners fairie, the always silly and delightful Bill Murray- endearing even when being an awful human being, sweet Karen Allen as his girfriend, and even Robert Mitchum and Buddy Hacket, John Houseman, Lee Majors...C'Mon! I can't find it playing this year, (so far at least), and I'm truly upset/disappointed. Grab an eggnog or a hot toddy, put on your silly Christmas pajama, and settle in for a goofy, fantastical night of story telling and giggles!"
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),A sweet christmas treat,"What a wonderful movie this was. Richard attemborough is a perfect santa. He has a warm and calm about his performance. His unsucpecting but you know its him. Maya was great too and they had a real bond. So in this film santa gets a job as a santa for a mall. But a rival toy shop wants him too, of couse nobody relized he is indeed the real santa. There are some hilarius bits here and there and it was nice seeing daphne from fraiser in it aswell. It all leads to a courtroom battle that was pretty fun to watch and had some festive cheer to go along with that aswell. Overall miracle on 34th street was a warming and sweet film."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),Back when Manhattan actually had a white Christmas.,"Was this remake necessary? Probably not. Is it better than the original? Definitely not. Does a 90's perspective make an impact? Definitely. It shows a much more cynical world, an even more materialistic holiday season, and definitely a forced sense of holiday spirit that in modern ideals makes Christmas 1994 seem like a dream. The perfection of this film comes through a romanticized version of New York City that has never existed, as well as the casting of the legendary actor turned director Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle and newcomer Mara Wilson as the little girl whom one person describes as acting 38. The fault of thar is her cynical world weary mother, Elizabeth Perkins, who works planning the Thanksgiving parade (not Macy's; that was forbidden by the company loyal to the 1947 film), resentful of the fact that her husband disappeared shortly after Wilson was born. Perkins will never replace the memory of Maureen O'Hara, but in a sense it's a supporting part. Attenborough and Wilson certainly aren't going to top Edmund Gwenn and Natalie Wood, but they don't discredit the parts either. My issue with this film is in its darkness, especially through nasty drunken Santa (Jack McGee) who's truly vile as he baits Kris into striking him. Store rivals James Remar and Jane Leeves are rather cold business types, the kinds of vile business oriented robots who obviously have coal where their hearts could be. But Dylan McDermott is all charm as Perkins' love interest, and Robert Prosky is a delight as the judge. So while I don't find this horrible, it's definitely lacking the feel good message and magical elements of the original that even at its darkest didn't feel like cold Christmas pudding."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),"I swear to tell the truth, so help me God","Not to sound a little grinchy , but this remake for me is just a little too Chris Cringey. The whole courtroom drama part for me is so incredibly over egged and I find it hard to enjoy what is in essence a reworked version of classic Scrooge. Miserable person sees the light and every one lives happy ever after with their every want or need granted without question. Don't get me wrong It's obviously supposed to be feel good and festive which it does a reasonable job at. But I can't see past the cheesiness and the hopeless romantic storyline as it is just plain boring. The young actress whose name escapes me is undoubtedly the star of the show and does a great job as she did in a number of movies of that era. But the rest of the cast are mediocre at best. With Richard Attenborough, as good as he looks is in my opinion a little tiresome with his portrayal of the whiter than white Father Christmas. Maybe its me but I just can't get on board with a santa who is so open with his identity and also who is so easy to just give up when he gets committed. As I say the premise is hard to get on board with. Santa should be incognito and omnipotent. Not outed and pathetically fragile. Leave courtroom dramas for cop and crime shows. Not my favourite by any means I'm afraid."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),"Not necessary, but not terrible, either","The original Miracle on 34th Street didn't need a remake, but this version isn't terrible. I actually think Richard Attenborough makes a great Santa Claus, and Elizabeth Perkins portrays a skeptical mother pretty well. However, this new adaptation makes some unnecessary additions that don't really add anything to the story (though they certainly add to the runtime) and it changes some parts that lessen the overall impact of the movie. I'm not surprised that people still choose to watch the classic 1947 film each year instead of this, but I don't mind watching the 1994 version every few Christmases."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),"Watched back to back, you stick with the original","Last night I watched the original Miracle on 34th Street, then the 1973 made for TV version with Sebastian Cabot. The 1973 version was a mess, with some truly head-shaking script and production decisions that simply made no sense, and I suspect were the result of cost-cutting by the producers. Cabot did fine and David Hartman, too, other than his final courtroom scene, which was atrociously bad, but the rest of the cast were either miscast or never found their roles ... possibly rushing into filming the scenes or maybe just terrible direction. This film was a MAJOR slide down the slope from even that disaster. No Macy's? The ""Cole"" Thanksgiving Day Parade? Bad start to begin with. There's no such thing and people know that. Macy's wouldn't participate in this film and I suspect it's because they saw this anathema of a script. Once again, the Santa is fine and the lawyer is okay, but EVERYONE else is a disaster, from the evil rival store owner to the cold, heartless Mrs. Walker, whose first name was AGAIN changed. Why?? And yes, they changed the lawyer's name, too. Why?? In the original, Maureen O'Hara plays Walker as a sensible ""modern woman"", but with warmth. Elizabeth Perkins' version of Walker is a post-NOW ""modern woman"" who is not only cold, but mean spirited. When the lawyer proposes marriage and she tells him, with ice in her voice, that he's ""a fool"", I was done with this travesty. The addition of the ""evil rival chain"" does nothing for this story. In the original, Macy's and Gimbal's are at least friendly rivals, and let's remember this is a SANTA STORY which should be aimed predominantly at kids. The 1973 version lost that thread with vodka in the morning, and this one loses it with a complicated business plot which makes little sense and gives us too many ""bad guys"". James Remar and his female sidekick offer nothing to the story. They don't even bring a real sense of foreboding. Billed as a comedy, in watching the first half of this film, there was NOTHING even remotely close to giving me a smile, much less a laugh. This is what happens when lesser talents try to leech the brilliance of original writers and creators. They have no chance to improve on the original, and each misstep does nothing but corrupt what made the original a multi-generational success. Shame on Siskel and Ebert for originally approving this disaster. They got it very, very wrong ... which happened more often than you'd think."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),"A good old fashioned christmas miracle, taditional feel good film","I'm surprise this has such a low score on Imdb perhaps because there are no cars being blownup and huge explosions . To me this is one of the Christmas classics, (and remake of older black and white film) Miracle on 34th Street is up there with 'It's a wonderful life', 'A Christmas Carol - George C Scott version' and 'Love Actually' and a few others. Attenborough is just brilliant as Kringle and the theme is do we believe in Santa Claus This is a lovely film , for all the family, and can be watched multiple times, particularly suited to every Christmas Good old fashioned, feel good, happy ending story 8/10."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),Miracle on 24th December (2022) soon (2023),"Don't, please. I said, don't! You are too late bla bla blaa! It's never too late! And I'm glad because I watched now! I wouldn't feel that before, as I felt now! So, I got chance to see many many in last time,
I've seen and many many old ones,
but haven't seen something like this one! (And don't, please don't tell me about original, I ain't youu Scroogiesssss who compare just so you could have trash talk about..) so as I said. It's.. it's miracle! It really is! Story is beautiful! Actors/Actresses, as born for their roles! It was like when you go in shooping and you chose wise, check all before you.. well they done it here! Tim is my favorite Santa Clause! But this one, this one is..
How to say that.. Tim is Santa, now we tryin to find and his replacment in new series..
But this Santa, it's like first Santa, original! The one, before all of them! Watching him as Santa is like watching some old really old too wise man, like angel in human form,
like some sensei with whom you want to spend as much as time as you have, to listen, watch, and learn! To be like him! So.. yeah, have to change my list, update to say. Others, him, her.. like couple from dream, movie! Not those today, classy, from before! Example of lady and man,
they just did too great! Little one, oh dear Lord! How ? Don't answer that! Haha! It's just magical movie! It's miracle! And I'm thankful because I've got chance,
how much, almost 30 years later..
If folks back then would knew for today's..
It would have at least 8 as raiting. This is timeless! And one of those, for reprise! Thank you all of you who made this possible! I know with this you've changed, still, and 'll do..
from views about life, to everything else! So many great messages/lessons! Thank you!"
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),"Never tire of this lovely, charmer","I challenge everyone to find any actor, any extras, any children, ANYONE in the movie who is wearing jeans. You won't. And if the actor should be wearing jeans or work clothes, it'll be a shot from the waist up. There's a scene showing dozens of children lined up in Macy's to sit on Santa's lap and tell him what they want for Christmas. Every single kid is dressed to the nines. Their parents are in business suits or beautiful dresses and coats. It's just a classy, beautiful remake of a very old, very sweet Christmas movie. Oh, and everyone's hair is perfectly cut, combed and styled. Everyone. Not a single detail was overlooked.👏👏👏👏👏👏. Such talent n the director, producer, crew, actors, everyone."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),The Christmas Friedzone,"There's no doubt about it this movie is definitely a Christmas classic. It's fun to see a real life Santa, especially in the real world with a court case, skeptics, and drunk Santa fakes. Just about
everything in this movie is perfection, but I only have one qualm. I'm sure for its time it was perfectly acceptable, but looking at it now, the love story is atrocious. The woman makes it very clear that she's not interested in the man, he proposes to her anyway, she says no so he gets mad at her for not feeling the same way. Then somehow they end up together at the end of the film? What!? Certainly explains why some ""nice guys"" feel so entitled to relationships. Again, minor flaws with the movie. Overall it was a fun holiday movie, and I'll surely watch it in Christmases to come. I just know that every time I do, the Love story will forever bother me."
Miracle on 34th Street (1994),An okay remake of one of the greats,"The original might be the greatest Christmas movie ever made. Any remake was going to be up against it. John Hughes' ""Miracle on 34th Street"" makes a good try but only gets so close. This movie looks great. There's one beautiful shot after another. The cast is okay, I guess. Mare Wilson and Richard Attenborough fare the best with James Remar, Jane Leeves bringing up the rear. John Hughes' script is okay too. Hughes manages to nail some scenes but a lot of the movie isn't very good. The whole thing with the evil store across the street doesn't work at all. Warts and all, this ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is worth the watch every once in a while. Honorable mention: the sign language scene. (I saw this movie in the theater (Movie World, Douglaston, NY) when it first came out.)"
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),The Philopher's Stone,"I never read any of the books, however I listened to audio books of Harry Potter 3-7, so I can't say how accurate this is to the book, I do however know that the first two movies are supposed to be the most accurate to their source material, anyway lets start with the review. It's been years if not over a decade since I watched the HP movies, this one was like 4 years ago. I loved those movies as a kid growing up with them and I still do. The story is great, the effects look better than most of todays and the score is also terrific. The characters are also well written and well portrayed. 9/10 free roaming trolls."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),Imaginative tale of a boy who discovers he has magical powers,"Harry Potter - Daniel Radcliffe - lives in half misery with his aunt, uncle, and annoying cousin Dudley. They treat Harry poorly, giving him castoff clothes and more. One day, things change. A man named Hagrid comes calling on Harry's 11th birthday with astonishing news. Harry is the son of two wizards who died trying to protect him and Harry has powerful magical abilities himself. It's bye bye to his relatives and on to to Hogwarts school for Wizards. Harry has a reputation he learns, for a lightning bolt scar on his forehead is a reminder he fought off a dark wizard named Voldemort when he was a baby! Soon Harry has good friends Ron and Hermione and is learning spells, potions and a flying broomstick game called Quidditch. BUT, there is a professor Snape who seems to have a disliking for Harry and there is a secret room where a three headed and fierce dog is hiding something precious. Can this young trio battle a dark plot which may be brewing? This beautifully presented film has so many strengths. The story, based on the famous book by JK Rowling, is imaginative and magical. The cast is a gallery of the finest British actors and young actors. Needless to say, the sets, costumes, effects and musical score are superb. My only caution is that there are some dark themes which might not please all viewers. However, most families will choose to follow Harry and his adventures many many times."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),Great beginning,"I was never a huge Harry Potter fan, but then again I never gave these movies a chance. After giving the first one a watch, I am very pleased with what I've seen. Although this film started off slow, once it picked up I was interested the whole time. The action in this film was actually surprising for a movie about magic, the effects for an older movie were also surprising. This movie left a lust for wanting more, something I never would have thought could come from watching these films. The acting of these young actors was also good for people so young. This film was a great first start for the franchise."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),A Magical beginning!,"First time I watched this movie as a six year old kid, I thought that it was a very scary experience. Now these days, a movie like that isn't probably so scary for younger kids than back in time, with time things are getting more and more normal for kids and young. Still, it isn't about the scariness, but about the magic that ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" contains. Based on the book by J. K Rowling, (That I really enjoyed reading) I think this is an amazing adaptation. The story becomes a fast icon in the world, and now everyone knows who the famous Harry Potter is, and I noticed the book shelfs became more empty with time, the book grossing go higher and higher, and I can't really argue, the story is developed so well, in the book and in the movie. But here it is about the movie of course. First of all, nothing is greater than some high quality music from our famous John Williams (Jurassic Park) and (Schindler's List) and the magical and convincing directing by Chris Colombus. The visual effects and scenography was on a fine level, Hogwarts castle is a rememberable building with so many hidden secrets to reveal. The acting was on a decent level, too, but the kids are playing way better than I would expect from a youngster. Harry James Potter performed by Daniel Radcliffe is a good addition to the film and he got into character. Harry's backstory with his parents makes the story even more dramatic and gets a better understanding for our main hero. Harry's two friends, Ron and Hermione, makes them the perfect trio, and they're showing friendship and courage in a good and valuable way. Since they're at school, some bullies got to be involved, and Draco Malfoy was a such a fun and menacing character as a kid. It's the beginning, so it's supposed to be the best one, but overall I think this is just a fine start and a great magical adventure. It's not bad, but it's nothing so impressive that I can give a very high rating. It's definitely a nice script, great acting and music, and something your kid can really enjoy (but for adults this may be just something decent)."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),Bad Snape and Dumblebore,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was an amazing movie. I loved the special affects, and the kid actors and actresses were very cute. The reason I rated it lower than I could have is because I didn't like Snape and Dumbledore. They almost whispered their lines, they were so quiet and much much more boring in the movie than in the book. In the book Professor Snape and Dumbledore were very important characters in the book, but in the movie Professor Snape and Dumbledore were unnecessary characters. Also a thing about the first 3 Harry Potter movies that I have watched is that Peeves the Poltigist is not in the movies. He is a character in the Harry Potter books that plays tricks on everyone. The filmmakers probably didn't have enough time for the troubled troublemaker. In all, I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10."
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),Solid Adaption to Kick Off a Phenomena,"This was my first time rewatching this movie. I made a joke to Jaime, my wife, about how the Harry Potter series of movies are Christmas movies. This idea happened when bringing up Die Hard. Last year, when we brought our daughter home from the NICU, we watched the latter ones. We both had seen them and just wanted something on in the background. What is interesting here is that knowing how things play out from reading the novels and then coming back a second time to the movies, there are things that I picked out. This does well in setting up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and helping not only us, but him learn the ways of the wizarding world. He was left in the care of his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw), Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) after his parents were killed. They raise him. Now that he's 11, he's ready to join that world that they hate. There is more to the world than he realizes when he goes off to Hogwarts and meets his new best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also meets his new rival, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). He is quite behind on what he should know and has issues with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). It is fun to go back to the beginning now that I know much more information. Jaime is also more of an expert here, which helps as well. This one isn't working with the budget that they'll have later. The CGI can be wonky. It is also fun to experience a world like this and we are there with Harry who had no idea about it either. This movie does a great job at bringing that all to life. I should also say that we have a great cast here featuring Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Verne Troyer, John Hurt, John Cleese and David Bradley, to just name more. Not a great movie but does a good job to start this series off. Another thing that I like is that as the characters get older, what they deal with gets tougher. It stays on a level where they can manage it, which is another perk that it has going for it. My Rating: 7.5 out of 10."

A book turned into a movie and is the first movie in the series. The series, consists of 7 books and 8 films. I think the acting is good ,it is entertaining movie. A movie that everyone of all ages can watch. I regret for not watching by now it is for years. In addition the effects of the film were also very successful.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001),Not the same anymore!,"This is where children like me began to dream of a different realm, where children like us (I was only four years old when it was originally released) began to believe in a world beyond the bounds of our universe, a place filled with wizards and magic and supernatural beings. I remember growing up with this series, my obsession was limitless, I used to idolise this, my admiration knew no bounds, but that was twenty two years ago, and now, upon my return, everything appears so different, nothing like the times I was infatuated with it. I suppose that as time passed, my perception changed, as did my outlook on life, as well as my tastes and preferences in movies. Fantasy isn't a genre I fantasize about anymore, which may explain why I don't find this film as appealing as my recollections suggest. Nevertheless, it has good world-building, enjoyable performances, and, most importantly, the contagious charm and innocence that I still love and care about!"
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Eli Roth stop making horror films,"Once again Eli Roth is set loose on the horror genre with very middling results. Can someone please stop him from making anymore as Thanksgiving is as generic as it comes. The film is littered with illogical events and has numerous horrendous plot holes. I'm not going over the plot of the film as its a simple rinse and repeat of everything that's come before it. The gory kill setups are incredibly poor and happen so fast, it felt like the writer and director just wanted to make sure they happened every few minutes to make sure the audience didn't fall asleep. The film is utter trash and an insult to true horror fans out there."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Pleased but let down,"Not every year you're gifed with a thanksgiving killer movie. This however excited me, but after watching it was let down. The killing was satisfying had some school scenes but the 6 or so deaths didn't make up for the buns plot and cringe acting. After seeing a tik-toker was in a horror movie I couldn't take it serious after that. This movie had potential and the trailer was short n sweet. Which was a GOTCHA moment for me, they delivered heavily as the appetizer but the main course was spoiled. There will be no left overs lol. That part definitely made me cringe up and saying it once wasn't enough of course they had to run that famous line back and say it again, like it was an ingenious idea on the writers behalf."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Modern slasher / horror,"I watched Thanksgiving with not too many expectations as I'm not a massive fan of the horror or slasher genre but thought I would give it a try. The first 20+ minutes were a bit confusing and I even checked if I was watching the film I thought I was, as the initial carnage is all self inflicted (in some of the better filmed parts), which sets the scene for what is to happen in this small town on the anniversary of this event. The line between seriousness and absurdity for this type of movie seems to be a fine one as we see all these gory and absurd deaths and, to me maybe it was taking itself a little bit too seriously. But the biggest problem I found was this type of 'disguise' of the perpetrator really narrowed down the potential identity possibilities (with out giving away too much, it's fairly obvious there are only a couple of realistic options). But anyway, it's a fun and enjoyable movie, and something different for this year so not a bad attempt overall. Worth a go if you are curious enough. 6/10."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),"Tasteless, store-brand version of superior Slasher films","I was excited for this film because the 2007 parody trailer in Grindhouse was campy and hilarious. This film is a complete departure from the OG trailer in tone and style. We thought about seeing this in the theater, and I'm so glad I didn't waste $20 but p!rated it later instead. Some moments feel jarring and out of place because establishing shots/scenes are missing. Filming basics 101: you have a setup, then a payoff. But the setup is missing over and over so the payoffs have no weight to them. The deaths happen too fast and then the film just moves on. The trampoline scene is just thrown in, but the trailer version was better. There was never any moment where the killer was in trouble or about to get caught. Whether a victim escaped the killer or not didn't matter to me because there wasn't much characterization leading up to the chases. So it's like, who cares? The gore was tasteless and frankly, MPAA should've slapped an NC-17 rating on this. Specifically the scene where he smashes a guy's head open with a meat mallet. The dumpster scene was ridiculous too, both in gore and just the physics didn't make sense. In the parade scene, the killer isn't dressed like a pilgrim anymore, but as a clown. I guess to surprise us? I appreciated the few brief humor moments. Movies like this shouldn't take themselves too seriously. Despite the funny moments, the extreme violence and depraved nature of the killings ruined the vibe. I liked the actors even if their Mass accents were over the top. The anxiety of wondering ""who's next?"" plays well. But ultimately, Thanksgiving is the store-brand version of superior slasher films."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),I didn't know this was a comedy horror.,"Sat down to watch this last night after wanting to see this movie since it came out. I came away a little bit disappointed with the whole movie. Firstly I didn't know this movie was a comedy horror, even though it's not classed as one, it certainly felt like one. The murder scenes were so over the top you couldn't help but laugh at them. As one reviewer stated on the Totally Killer review, that the problem when a movie is played for laughs, the tense and murder scene are not that frightening because of the comedy element. This I found spoiled the movie somewhat for me. Would I watch it again, no I wouldn't. Will I watch the sequel when it comes out in 2025, yes I will as I didn't hate the film but I felt it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. A struggling five star rating."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Not bad for a slasher,"Original kills. Gory as anything. Average reason for the bloodbath set out for by the killer/s??!!! Eli Roth's movies always go a cut above the rest (no pun intended) with the gore set to MAX with some brutal killings throughout the whole movie. While the character development felt a bit shallow, it still made me care for the survivors and think about what would happen the next. The shopping scene from the beginning of the film felt like it could've been straight out of a real life scene in modern day America, given the state of play they have provided the world the past couple years. Would recommend for an easy watch with not much else to think about. Look forward to the sequel."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),I don't get the hype,"Okay first let's start with the positives, the movie was highly entertaining. Even with its numerous flaws it was a movie I felt I could just relax to and enjoy watching. However there are just way too many flaws. The acting is the worst part for me. It's so OTT it's like if you told your 10 year old dramatic sister to act something out. I mean casting TikTokers in movies what has the world become! Get some decent actors who actually have talent unlike tiktokers. I don't think there was one actor who I recognised or deserved to be in a film. Bobby was the only I felt did alright acting I guess. The kills were a positive. They were goofy but also so freaking gory. The oven one was actually hard to watch and the victim didn't even deserve it. Alongside people who didn't deserve it, the killer (who is the sheriff) killed numerous innocent people that had nothing to do with the Black Friday incident. I'd understand if the killer was a teen but it's out of character for the sheriff to do that and also it kind of ruins his motive. The motive was really weak imo, it was surprising don't get me wrong but if he really wanted revenge you'd think he'd want to kill everyone who was in the store right? I mean the poor security guard didn't even do anything wrong it's not like he was going to stop the horde from breaking in anyway. There was also a lot of plot holes as well. I mean the killer shows up in two places at once. It happened numerous times. The most obvious is when he is talking outside with the other sheriff yet drugging Evan and Addison Rae and chasing the main girl through the school. The other one was when the main girl jumped over the fence and then somehow the sheriff is having a fight with Bobby and knocked out on the floor. I also don't really like the misuse of characters, I mean I was expecting Mitch to be a real hero in this film with an arc but he disappears after 10 minutes then appears late on just to jump around with a sign and then run away. Also with the nerdy guy who is set up to be an important character but then is just forgotten about after the party. The movie was setting it up to seem like there are 2 killers so I was kind of disappointed when there was only 1 killer that was incredibly unbelievable. There are other things but I think I've wrote long enough. To conclude, this movie is one you can just put on for fun if you don't want to focus too hard on watching a movie however I feel this movie doesn't exactly know what it wants to be. Sure I will re watch it and watch the sequel that releases in 2025 I think. However I don't feel like I can give this movie anything above a 4, it doesn't come close to any original slashers like scream, Halloween, I know what you did, etc..."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Hilariously poor slasher,"This is as predictable as it is poor.you will laugh through this more than you will jump or be scared.its like a combination of i know what you did last summer/final destination/scream except its not even on par with any of those films it tries to emulate. I should have switched it off to be honest but did,just,manage to see it through to its predictable ending. Ive a character limit to reach here but there is really no more to say on this movie,avoid it at all costs,watch paint dry or go cut the grass.anything is better than sitting through 105 minutes of this abysmal excuse of a horror/slasher."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),This film didn't really grip me the way I hoped,"I sense plot holes with the teasing of two killers. The footage of Gabby and Evan was moving before Yulia was killed, and unless the sheriff had the powers of transportation, there is no way he could have moved and changed outfits that quickly! Unrealistic and very disappointing. The ratings are way to high for this movie. I have no clue how it got such a high rating and I'm very irritated. This movie was hot garbage. I understand it had the 80s slasher feel but the acting had me like ""they not even trying"" Movie was all around bad from the acting to the reveal another boring slasher with no new ideas yawn."
Thanksgiving (I) (2023),Terrible and obvious,"The high reviews of this film are absurd. Obvious from the get go who the killer is, awful dislikeable boring characters, bored me to death half way through, like scream but without the history etc. Just wasn't all that enjoyable. Wouldn't recommend. The high reviews of this film are absurd.

Gremlins (1984),"Fun, chaotic, Christmas classic","Classic. This movie is just so so fun. The narration and opening is whimsical and very interesting and even kinda tense. Then when the movie slowly dishes out it's plot gizmo is there being the cutest creature in cinema. Also in general the plot is just fun it's both tense and exciting as it slowly hints at the darker undertones of the movie. When the gremlins do come out the movie is so chaotic and random that it is hilarious, it's exactly my type of humour. The chaos and charisma of all the gremlins is hilarious, the cuteness of gizmo will never get old, the whacky inventions from the dad are always interesting and fun (and very relatable), the music is amazing, the creatures for the most part look amazing and very realistic, this is just a very entertaining and fun kids horror dark comedy Christmas movie."
Gremlins (1984),Not A Bad Film!,"Have only seen bits & pieces of this film years & years ago on TV, but haven't seen it all the way through! I saw this tonight via a re-release at my local! The film sees a young man who gets a pet Mogway as an early Christmas present from his father who is a product designer! But when the pet gets wet & starts to multiply do things start to go wrong & when they eat after midnight, is when things take a turn for the worst when the whole town becomes overrun by the mischief making, hyper active creatures! I found the film to be pretty good, while it's not typically the sort of Horror film I'd go out my way to watch, I still thought it was decent! The effects are pretty good for its time, despite being fake looking in areas & over the top! The story is alright & the characters aren't too bad despite lacking in a bit of depth! The runtime I'd say is a little long at 1 hour & 42 minutes & the pacing could've used some work too, but it wasn't bad! The deaths were entertaining & the ending was satisfying too! Overall, it's a good film! While not as horror like as I'd want it to be, it was decent overall! 6/10."
Gremlins (1984),A wonderfully subversive (yet still accessible) holiday classic.,"I remember loving this as a kid, liking it a little less when I watched it at about 18, and now going back to loving it again at 26. I can't explain how... maybe watching it on Christmas helped? Gremlins is an incredibly fun movie, with a satisfying buildup of a first half that explodes into extremely entertaining madness in its second half. Jumping around in tone from Spielberg sentimentality to horror to slapstick comedy to one character's weirdly tragic backstory shouldn't work, but it kind of does. The fact it's so all over the place might add to its charm. It's a well-written and constructed movie though, so while it can be gleefully messy, it's definitely not a mess. Also, the special effects are all fantastic, and have aged extremely well. I remember the sequel being almost as good, so I look forward to rewatching that sometime soon."
Gremlins (1984),Capra-esque chaos with a Dante flavor,"Joe Dante was moving up in the world. He'd met some good success with The Howling, caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, and got the assignment to bring the script by Chris Columbus script about mysterious little anarchic creatures at Christmas. He ended up creating one of those Spielberg-tinged films that helped to define a certain feel of 80s family films that had a slightly more dangerous hint to them while also embracing a certain Frank Capra-esque feel of neighborhoods. I wasn't of the generation that really absorbed it through childhood, not seeing it for the first time until I was well into my twenties, but I can easily see how it would affect those who grew up with it more fully than it hit me. In Chinatown, Randal Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), a hapless inventor, finds a strange creature not quite for sale in a little shop and ends up buying it from the owner's grandson, taking it home as a present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). With his father being unable to sell any of his inventions and his mother remaining a housewife, the household is reliant on Billy's job as a clerk as a bank in the little town of Kingston Falls. He's smitten with his coworker Kate (Phoebe Cates) who also works at nights at the local bar, and he's at the mercy of Gerald (Judge Reinhold) at the bank as well as the wealthiest woman in town, Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday), who is a mix between the Wicked Witch of the West and Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life (a film we see on screen more than once). Things go wrong, of course, when Randal gives Billy the creature named Gizmo, and he starts breaking the three rules. He can keep Gizmo out of the sunlight pretty easily, but his young friend Pete (Corey Feldman) accidentally gets Gizmo wet, spawning five more little Mogwai. Billy takes one to the high school science teacher Mr. Hanson (Glynn Turman) who takes a blood sample for...reasons. But this all leads to both sets of Mogwai to getting their handlers to break the third rule, not to feed them after midnight, turning them from Mogwai to the titular gremlins. This is where the heart of the film is: Dante's combination of his love of 50s science fiction schlock with fun toys on screen with the Gremlins causing havoc wherever they go, first in the Peltzer kitchen where Randal's gadgets fill the place, giving the perfect place for Lynn (Frances Lee McCain), Billy's mom, putting one of them in a blender to wonderfully gruesome effect. The final half of the movie is just an escalating series of chaos as the Gremlins get beaten back, come back in heavily increased numbers, and just run amok all over Kingston Falls. The centerpiece really is the scene in the bar, a technical display of different puppets doing a wide assortment of Looney Tunes-inspired antics that really just gets lost in the puppetry and gags but is the most entertaining the movie gets. That's because the actual story is perfectly competently assembled by Columbus in the script and presented by Dante, but it's never really more than competent. It doesn't help that little subplots just kind of disappear like Judge Reinhold's character just not appearing in the film after about the third way mark even though he was obviously built to pay off with some kind of comeuppance in the final act. Billy doesn't really have much of an arc, which isn't a requirement in fiction (look at Marty McFly in Back to the Future), but he also doesn't have much of a goal other than survive the crazy night. Heck, it's not even really a goal to go out with Kate. He convinces her to go on a date with him before the chaos erupts. At least the chaos includes a fun ending for Mrs. Deagle, though. What drives the film is the technical side of things and the comedy, mostly stemming from the work of Dick Miller as a down and out schlub with Dante giving him room to just be himself. It all balances out to an entertaining little film somewhat in the style of Spielberg but undoubtedly Dante's with Dante wearing his influences on his sleeve. It's one of the things I like most about his movies, manifesting in this with the playing of It's a Wonderful Life to the presence of the Looney Tunes stuffed animals in the store late, Dante isn't afraid of paying explicit tribute to the movies and short films that he loved. It gives his films a young kid kind of energy that makes them surprisingly infectious, even if the actual narratives end up somewhat lackluster. Gremlins is a fun little 80s timepiece, Joe Dante's first effort to prove himself on a decently large scale, evidence that Spielberg had an eye for young talent, and an entertaining technical achievement. It really could have used another draft to both cut out some early stuff that got left on the cutting room floor in the edit and to give Billy something more of a specific goal to achieve through the chaos. Either that, or just lean far more into the chaos. Maybe the sequel will choose one of those two directions."
Gremlins (1984),One of the Best Modern Horror Comedy Classics,"In 1984, one of the most insane horror comedies was released by Steven Spielberg entitled Gremlins. Directed by cult filmmaker Joe Dante, the film was a huge hit with critics and audiences and is often regarded as one of the greatest horror comedies of the last 50 years. While it did gain infamy for its grotesque violence, which resulted in the PG-13 rating, it is still cherished to this day and spawned a sequel a few years later and a recent animated series on Max. As far as how the film holds up nowadays, it's probably one of the darkest comedies that works in what it set out to do thanks to its cartoony nature. The film follows a young man named Billy Peltzer who receives a strange creature from his father called a mogwai. When the mogwai spawns other creatures, they end up becoming small destructive monsters that all wreak havoc on Billy's town during Christmas Eve. At its core, Gremlins may seem like a cautionary allegory on consumerism, especially when the mogwai creatures are not to be handled by the ignorant American public. That being said, the film knows how to treat the mogwai as a proper pet in the form of Gizmo, who Billy looks after with certain restrictions like no bright lights or feeding after midnight. Once the other gremlins kick in however, that's when the film unleashes its cartoony slapstick and brutal violence on display. As gruesome and horrifying as the film may be, Dante knows to keep the balance between supernaturally scary and nonsensically humorous, so we are left laughing at the mayhem caused by the manic Gremlins as much as we are in horror of it all. There are very few films that have managed this blending of the genres as funnily as this one. In addition to Billy making for a charming lead in reacting to all the insanity, his girlfriend Kate Beringer is an added bonus to the film's sweet center. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates share cute chemistry with each other in lieu of all the frights, and it's easy to see them trying to make end's meet in a small town corrupted by the antagonistic miser Mrs. Deagle. While some characters don't leave as much of an impression as they could like Billy's condescending coworker Gerald Hopkins or Billy's inventor father, others like Billy's concerned mother, the cranky Murray Futterman, the experimenting science teacher Mr. Hanson or little Pete Fountaine all contribute some damage to the monsters or get the short end of the stick from them in different forms of comeuppance. Also, on top of a lot of crazy vocal effects for the gremlin creatures, Howie Mandel steals the show as Gizmo and can make even a small whistle or cry from the guy sound adorably heart wrenching. Add on a cunning performance from Frank Welker as the rebellious leader Stripe and you got one heck of a vocal cast. Now in regards to the phenomenal special effects work done on the gremlins, Chris Walas and team managed to blend cute and creepy in such a versatile manner. When one puts into consideration just how complicated the mechanics and puppetry was to pull off, it makes the film all the more spectacular just to see all the crazy stunts and pratfalls the gremlin creatures get to pull off. In many ways, the gremlins are more cartoony than any other depiction of the creatures in cartoons prior like Falling Hare or Russian Rhapsody, since the havoc wreaking chaos they ensue paints them as rambunctious teenagers going against society rather than merely strange creatures coming out of nowhere. Jerry Goldsmith's score conveys the dark humor and nonstop suspense flawlessly and John Hora's cinematography adds into the thrill of seeing strange creatures scramble from the shadows in lieu of the holiday season. Considering the influence of the Warner Bros cartoons at play, it's no wonder Dante and his crew took the chance to unleash their inner mania through the art of B-movie tributes. By blending horror and comedy with enough heart, frights and laughter all in 100 minutes, Gremlins holds up wonderfully as a modern Christmas classic. If you haven't seen this film before, you're curious about more of Dante's work or you're an overall sucker for wacky horror comedies, then this film is right up your alley. Now that the film is approaching its 40 year anniversary quite soon, there couldn't be a better time to check it out than this very moment. After all, you never know when something innocent could turn into something dangerous if one doesn't take their well being into consideration."
Gremlins (1984),"Comedy horror with entertainment, funny scenes and deft satiric edge","A young man inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet, Gizmo (Howie mandel voice), from a gift given by his father (Hoyt Axton).

Naturally, there're lots of mayhem , frolics , antics and jokes , this all happening at the town and the result is a gang of nasty gremlins who decide to tear up the houses and cinemas. This watchable enough motion picture was professionally directed by Joe Dante displaying their characteristic surrealist humor and sense of style . The story is nothing more than an amusing excuse to string together gags , silly sketches , ironical craziness , several cameos and fast-paced set pieces. Dante is surely right to let his visual imagination run along with likeable comedy, irony and great inventive. Including ¨Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs¨ and other famous film parodies and other musical extravaganzas of the past. Also incorporates satire , takes on TV news and funny action, adding a lot of rapid-fire surreal sight gags. Along with ordinary starring : Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, appearing here and there a number of familiar secondaries and various cameos, such as : Polly Holliday, Belinda Balaski, Keye Luke, Frances Lee McCain, Dick Miller, Edward Andrews, Judge Reinhold, Chuck Jones, William Schallert, Harry Carey Jr, Scott Brady, Steven Spielberg, Kenneth Tobey Nicky Katt, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks .And musician Jerry Goldsmish who composes a lively and enjoyable score. Followed by a sequel ¨Gremlins II¨, it's inferior to original, set in a futuristic skyscraper in the Big Apple where the young couple: Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates of now work for the money-grubbing tech-mogul John Glover, co-starred by Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky , Robert Picardo, Haviland Morris , Dick Miller , Raymond Cruz , Julia Sweeney , Keye Luke, Kathleen Freeman Lavishly Produced by Steven Spielberg , and professionally directed by Joe Dante, with originality enough. Dante's most hits took place when found himself working alongside Steven Spielberg, John Landis and Australian director George Miller for the anthology movie ¨The Twilight Zone, The Movie¨ (1983) in which Dante directed the third segment . Steven Spielberg then hired him to work as director for ¨Gremlins¨ (1984) which was another box-office success. He directed some episodes for the Sci-Fi series ""Amazing Stories"" before directing his next Science Fiction feature which was ¨Innerspace¨ (1987) which, whilst critically well reviewed, was another box office failure. After directing five episodes of ""Eerie, Indiana"", Dante returned to the big-screen with the well-received ¨Matinee¨ (1993), an affectionate period satire set in 1962 against the background of the Cold War. Dante spent the next several years working for television and directed a satire on politics with ¨The Second Civil War¨ (1997) . Dante's next two films, ¨Small Soldiers¨ (1998), and ¨Looney Toons: Back in Action¨ (2004) garnered good reviews but were not commercial hits. Gremlins rating : 7/10."
Gremlins (1984),Classic 80's Spielberg.,"I can't believe I've never watched this movie. I was an 80's movie kid but always steered away from the fantasy horror movies. I was more action and comedy. I wish I had watched this sooner, as it was pretty awesome. Classic Spielberg. The guy is a master at his craft and it shows here. His movies all have a similar awesome feel to them and you can sense it right away. What stood out most to me with this film was the animation. It was so good. There was some clay animation I think? Was it? But most of it was just good old puppetry and it worked. It was also hilarious. It didn't take itself too seriously and that was great. When the gremlins took over the town and chaos ensued I laughed out loud on a few occasions. I'm cautiously optimistic on the sequel! Hard to top this one!"
Gremlins (1984),Excellent Christmas Horror Comedy Movie from the year 1984,"I find Gremlins (1984) is a very excellent Christmas Horror Comedy Movie, Because the main protagonist Billy is very likeable. Gizmo The cute and adorable mogwai is very likeable. Billy's pet dog Barney is very heroic and likeable. Billy's love interest Kate has a tragic backstory and I feel very sorry for her. The main antagonist of this movie is Stripe, Because of his chaotic nature, but he is enjoyable compared the most Hateable character of the festive movie. The most Hateable character of the festive movie is Mrs. Ruby Deagle, Because of her cruel attitude and the lack of sympathetic qualities, But She finally got her comeuppance and that made me laugh. It also have interesting cameos from Steven Spielberg to Chuck Jones. I'm giving this a 10/10 and Merry Christmas."
Gremlins (1984),Still Enjoyable After All These Years,"This film begins with a middle-aged inventor by the name of ""Randall Peltzer"" (Hoyt Axton) browsing in an antique shop owned by an old Chinese man known only as ""Grandfather"" (Keye Luke). While there he happens to notice a strange little animal that he had never seen before and, upon inquiring about it, is told that it is called a mogwai. Noticing how cute and friendly it appears to be, Randall offers to buy it but is told it isn't for sale. Somewhat discouraged, he leaves the store but is approached by the old man's ""Grandson"" (John Louie) who secretly hands the mogwai to him in exchange for the money Randall offered earlier. After eagerly accepting the deal, Randall is then informed of 3 basic rules for taking care of the mogwai--with the main rule being to never feed it after midnight. After acknowledging these 3 basic rules, Randle quickly hurries back home where he presents it to his teenage son ""Billy Peltzer"" (Zach Galligan) as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, not long afterward, Billy accidentally feeds it after midnight--and extreme chaos starts from that point on. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I remember being quite entertained by this movie when it first came out and, having now watched it again, I must say that it still retains most of its earlier charm. Admittedly, the CGI and special effects aren't nearly as novel or sophisticated by today's standards but, even so, this is still an enjoyable movie, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
Gremlins (1984),Still Love it,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it when it came out. What's so funny to me is my brother adopted 2 rescue kittens I had several years ago. He named them Gizmo and Gremlin. They definitely resemble the characters in the movie. Gizmo is sweet and wouldn't hurt anyone or another cat, but Gremlin has a temper at times and can be mean. I HAVE to watch this movie again this Christmas season 😊. Have watched it many times and it never gets old. Love the story and interaction between the characters and of course there are so many humorous moments too. Although we are all older now, it's become a family tradition."
X (II) (2022),"Interesting premise, not well executed","The idea behind the movie itself is interesting, and some of the plot elements are unique and original. However, there was just too much skin for me. I had to look away for large chunks of film as things that were just not relevant to the plot were taking place on screen. Also, the director has apparently never talked to a senior citizen to know that human behavior and abilities change as one ages and becomes older. Not to give too much away, but the villains in the film did things that simply would not be likely or possible given their stage in life. It was interesting enough for me to want to watch the prequel. It was OK, but could've been better."
X (II) (2022),"Nice, Familiar Comfort Food","Though X doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, it's commendable in how it manages to pay homage to the films it's inspired by and also track its own path through. The cast impresses with the likes of Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, and Brittany Snow among other familiar faces. Directed and written by Ti West, he's brought a strong premise and a diverse cast of characters to a centralized location and lets everything play out in spectacular fashion. There's some great kills in the film as well. Though not everything is fantastic (Jenna Ortega's character went out with a whimper instead of a bang, despite getting her head half-blown off), the film is greater than the sum of its parts. And as a growing part of a franchise, it's the best of the series thus far."
X (II) (2022),"""People's eyes are gonna pop out of their damn skulls when they see this.""","FILM: 7/10. In Ti West's foray into the realm of classy slashers with X, he takes the genre on a highbrow escapade-well, his version of it. The film mirrors this ambition as characters embark on a quest to shoot a high-class porno, setting the stage for an unconventional yet intriguing experience. West succeeds in delivering more than your typical titillating slasher. Character development takes the spotlight, providing a depth rarely found in the genre. As the plot unfolds, it becomes evident that West is not interested in taming the horror; he aims to send shivers down your spine with graphic kills that punctuate the narrative. The performances across the board are nothing short of excellent, capturing the essence of the 1979 setting. Mia Goth shoulders the lion's share of the work, while Brittany Snow proves to be very effective. Kid Cudi, in a surprising turn, delivers an excellent performance that adds to the film's overall charm. However, the film misses an opportunity to explore a potentially compelling connection between Maxine and Pearl, two characters whose untapped dynamic could have elevated the narrative even further. Despite this, X stands as a highly entertaining and well-made horror film, showcasing West's ability to infuse sophistication into a genre often associated with gratuitous thrills. West's journey into classy horror is one worth taking. FORMAT: Blu-ray VIDEO: 9.5/10. 1080p presentation

X (II) (2022),Tries to be too many things ends up being not much,"The early scenes with the fixed long shot look perfectly 70's horror. That got my hopes up. Add in the creepy farmhouse and some decent moments of building tension along with a couple jump scares and I was thinking it was going to be quite good. The sex scenes are a bit more involved than the early horror, Friday the 13th, type movies; but it still follows the formula. Then about halfway through, it switches to the gross/icky type of horror movie. And around then it also becomes the very predictable horror movie. The main cast was actually really good. That gave me a lot of hope for the movie early on. The old couple was not good, especially the 'old' lady and their story line was also pretty bad. A key to good horror movies is wanting to yell at the main characters to not do something or to get out of there. But no matter how much I liked the main characters their deaths were so predictable and the old couple was so distracting that it ruined the shock."
X (II) (2022),What a snooze fest,"It's so sad to see amazing films come out of A24, and then have to rate them next to this... whatever this is. To say this film was boring is an understatement. This film DRAGGED the entire way through. The timing of the kills was even off. Found myself skipping through the intense scenes because you can only stab someone so many times before it looses its shock value. There is a lack of plot this entire movie other than old people wanting to yoink each other, but they are too old so they need some young people to do it for them? It's also a highly unbelievable film as they have the old couple killing couples in their 20's/30's in very mobile ways but they are introduced being very pitiful and Ill. Wanted to see why ""Pearl"" is rated so highly and this was barley talked about. Guess we know why now."
X (II) (2022),If you wondered why people liked it... me too,"There is truly nothing to this movie. I would say the greatest offense is that even if it was an ""homage"" to classic slashers, it adds nothing to nor does it reflect the best of the genre. There is no pay off. No suspense. It is utterly devoid of creativity. Plenty of people will say it was just a good ol tits'n'guts movie but there are legit better ones that don't pretend to be more than they are. This is that kid in class who pretends they DISCOVERED Evil Dead. It is painfully boring and when the only redeeming part (murders) comes to a head they are boring. That's this movies sin. It is boring."
X (II) (2022),"In ""X', Tie West ventures into the slasher category, using as a reference the cinema of the revolutionary and subversive Tobe Hooper","In his newest film, ""X', Tie West ventures into the slasher category, using as a reference the cinema of the revolutionary and subversive Tobe Hooper. More precisely, West focused on Hopper's first two films that received commercial appeal, namely "" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)"" and ""Devoured Alive (1976)"". Considered the pioneer of the slasher before ""Halloween"", the film that immortalized the figure of Leatherface is a unique piece in the history of cinema, and although not told a true story, as was announced at the time of its release, it had a categorical particularity in presenting a premise so terrifying and disturbing that it seemed to be a real record at times, about a brief trip between friends that had a brutal and suffocating outcome Following the shocking sick representation of human perversity, ""Devour Alive"" featured another ghastly plot in which an old owner of a roadside hotel killed potential guests and served them as food for his pet crocodile. Knowing the many interpretations of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the American cultural context, its impact as a landmark of visual change for horror, language, and also as a precursor to the generic elements that characterized the subgenre, Ti West arrived in his slasher subversive ""X"", which points a lot of inspiration to those who strongly influenced the niche, which also includes nods to ""Psycho (1960)"" by Alfred Hitchcock (as well as ""Eaten Alive"" composed), but still, manages to deliver a result clayey and authentic. In the wake that paved the way for an impressive recognition of Hooper's classic, it was the same one that also promoted controversial discussions for an archetype condemned in the film with regard to female representation. If the final girl originated from there, it was possible to observe a contradiction behind the image of the final girl, because she received that name after having all the misfortune and violence prolonged longer than other characters, and in the end, surviving. In this discursive liner, West focuses his story to talk about the search for female independence, the escape from the role played by patriarchy through Maxine (Mia Goth), the protagonist who aims for her emancipation and success as a porn film star. The year is 1978, and here we follow a group of young adults in the race to shake up the porn industry with a feature film with a more elaborate and authorial language than what productions used to deliver at the time. ""X"" is divided into two parts with very different tones. In the first, by the way, the best of them, there is the construction of a great atmosphere of expectation. In the midst of preparing the ground for a carnage announced from the first scene - basically, the entire plot is one big flashback -, Ti West displays several signs of intertextuality, that is, how much he will drink from the fertile sources of his reference. One of them is Psycho (1960), a film by Alfred Hitchcock cited as one of the favorites of the director's character with artistic ambitions, one who is committed to making ""quality porn"". Later on, when the killing begins, the appearance of the car partially submerged in the lake is a creative way of diversifying the nod to good old Hitchcock's masterpiece, now with something from the film manifesting itself in the narrative fabric. Therefore, intertextuality has distinct layers and ways of being. Another of them is the reappropriation of a slasher commonplace: sexual rage as an indication of who is going to die. Even the two characters who don't have sex end up dying brutally. But what changes here is the motivation of the villains. Out comes the pure juice of abstract redneck moralism and in comes sexual repression enhanced by the messianic discourse of religious people who contribute to this repression. The script signed by West points out that this violence has a source. The second part of ""X"" is the massacre itself. But, before talking about it, it is good to consider the curious figure of murderous hosts. Pearl (Mia Goth) and Howard (Stephen Ure) are isolated people, emotionally trapped in a distant time of glory. However, beyond this aspect that helps to contextualize the murderous rage, there is an aesthetic choice by Ti West: the clearly fake makeup that transforms two relatively young actors into cachectic elderly people. This choice is part of an apparently deliberate movement towards the artificial, a wink at the audience regarding the purely cinematic nature of what they are watching - there are many other moments in which the plot asks us to turn off disbelief and adhere to artifice. When the old men take action, the story plunges into a spiral of more or less predictable brutal deaths until only the final girl remains - a famous narrative trope in horror productions, the survivor who faces the evildoers last and who (usually) is left to tell the story. Therefore, adherence to models established by other films takes place within a new layer of intertextuality, with tradition serving as a source of nourishment and emotional inspiration. As for slave deaths, it is therefore not a question of ""if"" they will happen, but of ""when"" and ""how"". West's filmic structure, which is configured by the slow way in which the narrative is conducted, valuing how language can tell a story, gains points in the way in which the premise unfolds, thus showing planning (and not the sensation as in other works, from the potential being with you in favor of chaotic twists) to having pornography as a background on the female independence that ""X"" discusses, in addition to the degradation of humanity in the face of banal repressions and vanities. The title of the film follows the beauty of the mystery that is Maxine, being referred to as an x-factor, a difference, someone of notable and special quality. The character is enigmatic, with few dialogues, but who does not spare herself when she needs to impose her personality and preferences, and there is a shock in this profile when she is close to Pearl, the scary lady, who runs the farm alongside her husband, Howard (Stephen Ure). The way Pearl is presented draws attention due to the setting's always dim lighting, her intimidating posture and her undeniable feeling of being seduced by Maxine. While the young woman's search, in which each decision is a consequence of the strength and success of her autonomy, is what defines her trajectory, for Pearl, facing a woman who in her own youth exudes freedom, confronts her denial, bitterness and dissatisfactions that hide in her idyllic farm. Giving more strength to this dichotomy, her names become an allegory in how Pearl (pearl) sees herself, with Maxine (maximum) being the example of achievement that she did not achieve, although her name refers to something precious, lasting. Therefore, Eliot Rockett's photography was fundamental for maintaining a careful play of shadows to manifest a character lost in repressed feelings. Still on the technical side, photography and costumes stand out in recreating an atmosphere that takes us directly to the films of the 70s to this ""X"" - everything looks like a vintage filter). And before I say that everything seems too ""artificial"" or ""decorated"", Ti West brings out the great cast who, super comfortable in their roles, make the fun happen. The script and the construction of the characters have weight in this, with the twist that the protagonist's plot undergoes in the last moments being one of the best moments of this creation. The discussion between puritanism and ""sin"", a classic slasher subplot, is turned inside out by a body of well-developed characters and highlighted in excellent dialogues that subvert the roles traditionally imposed by society - something that is not surprising to us, given that it seems We are much more likely to see coherence and integrity in a bunch of porn artists than in ""church rats"" and religious conservatives in general. By openly gesturing to the slasher audience with such clear affiliations to the subgenre's conventions, Ti West doesn't seem concerned with the predictability factor. After the first murder takes place, the feature film simply relies on the construction of the graphic aspect of the deaths, losing a little interest in the atmosphere of suspense that had created such an interesting and rich panel in its first half. The games with the supposed clandestinely of pornographic films, with the artistic intentions of the jealous beginner filmmaker, with the clichés linked to the performers of productions for adult consumption, with the stereotyping of almost caricatural villains and even with the texture of the image, come out. A sequence of savage eliminations of outsiders linked to cinema. Among these deaths, there are some filmed with ingenuity and very well calculated touches of cruelty - like the lady stabbing someone until the knife gets stuck in a vertebra. There are others that are practically jokes with certain recurrences of terror - like someone who clearly shouldn't look into the holes in a stable wall. But, overall, this somewhat repetitive carnage (brief isolation of the character about to die plus conclusion with touches of nonsense) serves as much as its intertextuality weighs, the balance of which is the commotion provoked through the sharing of familiarity with the pillars from slasher."
X (II) (2022),"More creepy than scary, elevated by performances","At times it feels like a film school project, at times it is really good, but mostly it's creepy more than scary. Starts off like an 80's porno but lacks real feeling or meaning. It's a mcguffun (a term even mentioned in the film). Ok some pretty hot bodies but it's as sexy as making a porno probably is. The farmer and his wife are excellently cast and again creepy as F. Brittany Snow, Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth do great jobs of very archetypal characters with little story. Snow's singing is also impressive. However the switch into horror/slasher mode lacks scarriness, you know what's going to happen and it lacks suspense. Yeah it has referential scenes like the window in psycho, the ""here's Johnny"" scene from the Shinning, the lake and pier from Friday the 13th and others, but they are more like signposts than adding anything. Also the male actors, apart from the farmer, don't add much other than cannon fodder. Again archetypal characters but lacking the depth the girls bring. And it just gets crepier and well yuck near the end. The ending has a nice twist though. So for the performances and parts of the movie it is good but let down by execution, lack of suspense and just being a bit too ick for me. So it's a slasher 80's flick made for our times, a decent time waster but not a classic you will want to watch again and again."
X (II) (2022),"X is unique for sure, but it didn't necessarily work for me.","Finally got around to watching Ti West's highly acclaimed film 'X,' and I have mixed feelings about it. It definitely boasts a fantastic retro vibe and a creepy, dreamlike atmosphere that lingers with you. There's a palpable sense of unease and impending doom throughout, which I absolutely loved. Additionally, Mia Goth delivers a stupendous performance in both her roles as Pearl and Maxxine. Her character, Pearl, is undeniably creepy and scary. The movie also features some brilliantly unhinged kills. However, the film does suffer from a disjointed narrative and, at times, feels like a parody. It gives the impression of being a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. Furthermore, there are moments where it seems to strive for excessive artistry, which can be overwhelming."
X (II) (2022),Not Worth!,"To be honest, I don't see any potential in the story as a serial or slasher, the film is imitated solidly I would praise the production for that as for Mia Goth's role playing, all talent, this girl can play anything would say the same for Jenna Ortega but i give mia goth the win in this movie unlike with the story of the film, the course of the film, I am disappointed the movie doesn't make any sense like the middle of the movie is missing or would fall asleep every 2 minutes as a slasher film or a horror or thriller, it does not deserve this title at all A24 production has certain good films this is really the worst horror this year for my taste."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),Fans did it better... Try watching the Fazbear Frights fan version...,"I watched the original back on Halloween Day in the cinemas (fan of the franchise since 2014), and I think while the movie was good, it wasn't much of a Five Nights at Freddy's. The only thing reminding its material was the animatronics and that's it. I was bored because despite some clues reminding of the game this pretty much was a generic ghost children film, and due to that some scenes were unwatchable due to the audio (at least for me, it felt so out of place with the score choice that killed the vibe). However, I was lucky that previews of a Re-edited version came in my way on YouTube and I reached out the editor to watch a copy of a fanedit called ""Fazbear Frights Edition"". To my surprise, it didn't change much to the original besides some extended kills and reconstructed moments for being more accurate to what we grew up with, but details like more Easter Eggs and the use of fanmade quality soundtrack MADE IT A BLAST! The only reason I'm writting this review is because Blumhouse or Universal should hire this editor! He managed to save this after all! Not bored at any moment, reconstructed atmosphere - A ROLLER COASTER BALANCING BETWEEN HORROR AND NOSTALGIA! So, my rating for the original is 5 out of 10, but for the fanedit 8 out of 10. Will definitely watch again. And now here's my question, how could a fan execute it better in a couple of months than a studio working on it for 9 years?"
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),Five Nights at Freddy's: One of the biggest let downs of 2023,"Plot A troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's. Cast Passable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan. Verdict I'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really ""Got"" them which frustrates me. The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed. Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention. When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones. FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more. Rants I weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it. Breakdown Looks the part
Matthew Lilliard is decent here
Hutcherson always looks like he's bored
Weak kills
Pants plot
Too much melodrama."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),Love it,"I loved it! It had a great storyline, and I overall loved all the characters. I do think it could've been a little bit less drawn out. I think it's a great movie to sit down and watch with your 10 to 14-year-old. It's not very gory, nor does it have anything too horribly bad, but for someone in my perspective, I was very disappointed that in some points it wasn't very accurate to the game Gore wise because if you're a fan of five nights at Freddy's like me, I really wanted the movie to not hold back but it's definitely a movie for preteens they're not quite ready for a real horror, movie,. But passed all that I really enjoyed the movie, and I would definitely stand and watch it again."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),Fnaf movie review,"I have been a fnaf fan since 2018. And now we finally have a movie about it! So I watched the movie on October 27 and it was a mixed movie, I liked the fnaf movie. I just wish it was more horror and maybe less story, there should have been more security camera scenes like in the game and flashback scenes and more of a nostalgia soundtrack, and make the movie like a PG-13 horror movie vibe. As a horror movie it's a 4/10 but as a fnaf movie 8/10 the movie is a pretty good movie for fans to enjoy like me, The horror scenes and the final battle with William afton was very good I recommend this :)."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),"Good movie, not so great adaption...","The cinematography and a few of the actor/actresses acting was great, but there are multiple problems. First of all, we now have a game adaption of the lore, and book, AND a movie adaptation. They're all different and that just makes the story even more confusing. The main characters I really didn't think were played or written well were Vanessa, Abby, and the ghost kids. The acting wasn't the best with them, and I get their kids but Vanessa was just straight up written horribly. Josh Hutcherson did a great job playing Michael Schmidt, and his character wasn't written terribly but besides him and maybe the villains, the acting and writing wasn't great. Now Matthew Lillard was amazing, wished he had more screen time but his acting was phenomenal, and his lines were written perfectly. I won't get into too much detail with the story but here's the basics, Mike gets a job, people break in for money and to get him fired so evil aunt can take custody over his sister, Abby, and the evil aunt is a smoking addict and is pure evil. Then after they attempt to get him fired they all die from the animatronics, and Mike meets Vanessa and gets left off with a warning. They all slowly find out that ""Steve Raglin,"" or, better known as, William Afton, took Mike's younger brother Garret and killed multiple children in the 80's. It's later revealed that he's Vanessa's dad, and then he gets spring locked. Boom, the whole movie right there. Now let me explain the game lore, (idk the books) and you'll see the difference. William Afton, Belle Afton, Elizabeth Afton, Michael Afton, and Evan/Chris Afton (we don't know his name those are just assumptions) are all a family, William is friends with a dude named Henry Elizabeth, which together they make a business titled, ""Fredbear's Family Diner."" William's son was scared of the animatronics, and that was good, since he wanted to make sure that he didn't go near them since they were dangerous, but he wanted to make sure that he was terrified of them so hr had his older brother, Michael Afton, scare him with them. Michael took it too far though, and placed Evan/Chris, in Fredbear's mouth. Before I continue I'd like to say there are two animatronics, Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. Now continuing on the story, his whole frontal lobe gets bitten off and he enters a coma in the hospital, (fnaf 4) and William is very mad with Michael. Next one to die is Elizabeth Afton. William made a new establishment named Sister Location. Or at least the game is titled that. There are four animatronics, Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Foxy, and Funtime Freddy. Then there's Ennard which is an animatronic that was made by the other animatronics. Elizabeth gets lured by Circus Baby, closer to her, with Ice Cream, so she can scoop her. Scooping is when a claw that's supposed to hand out ice cream, reaches out from their stomach and grabs a child. She got scooped and killed. Then Williams wife Belle died to Ballora, William got spring locked in a Spring Bonnie suit because ghost children that he murdered were chasing him (this was at a newer establishment that came after an improved establishment, that was after sister location. The one after sister location was Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where a security guard there got his frontal lobe bitten off by an animatronic named mangle. (the bite of 87) And the one after that is where he got spring locked. The new Freddy Fazbear's pizza. (Aka fnaf 1) Then the last one to die was Michael Afton, who got scooped in between the years 1993 and 2023. So there you go. Two completely different stories but it's the same franchise. That's the main reason this movie wasn't an 8, 9, or 10/10. That was all, bye bye! 😃"
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),If you don't know the lore... you'll miss the point,"Video game movie finally made for fans! If you don't want to invest the time in the games, watch the ""Game Theory"" four part FNAF timeline series on YouTube for a quick, dark, and mind bending story before watching the movie and it'll change your perspective. *Spoiler Alert* for some reason they switched character rolls. (in movie) They made Vanessa, William Afton's daughter where in game she's an innocent person used to fill the roll of a murdered girl to her grieving mother NOT the daughter of the murderer...
and Mike (in game cannon William Afton 'the murderer's son)...
Was mad an unsuspecting third party who's brother was killed by Afton in movie. Confused? K, you're normal. A video game movie made for fans, finally!"
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),Good Movie,"It's a good movie but it could be a bit longer. Plus isn't that scary. Now to the Pros of the movie, the animatronics look great! Even Sparky and the Spring Bonnie costume looks good! The part where the robbers break in and die was also great, Short but great! Also the start where the old night guard dies is good but not perfect, Also would have loved to see Markiplier but that was cut. Not 10/10 because the plot is not that good. Oh yes and the jumpscares, they were good but not effective and the balloon boy jumpscares were a bit scary on my first watch through but not any more though of course because I expect them now. And the red eyes aren't as bad as people thought well there only there for a few scenes. And there done if there's anything else you want to hear about it check other reviews now thinking about it no one reads through them so this is kinda pointless but eh."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),A Genuine Disappointment,"I was quite pumped to see this! I haven't played the game but I was aware of it. However the trailer for this movie certainly looked like something I would be into! I toughed it out for slightly over an hour and had to turn it off! I was beyond bored to be really honest. It was a whole lot of repetitive, snooze fest scenes! I was expecting much more given the great cast list I am a fan of Josh, Elizabeth and Matthew. But I was very unimpressed by the movie overall. I was intrigued still with 1/2 questions which I asked someone that had watched it all for! And when they answered my questions I can truthfully say I'm glad I didn't bother to finish it! Complete waste of time."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),It was ok.,"A young man in debt takes a job as a security guard in a restaurant. The robot dolls there have apparently developed a life of their own. Note: I haven't played the underlying game so I can't make any comparisons. If you ignore the opening scene, there is initially little that suggests a horror film. It's more like stripped-down drama elements that dominate the film, at least in the first half hour. The scenes that are supposed to be really frightening often fail to have an impact, especially since there is almost no blood shown. In general, the plot feels more geared towards the mystery genre, as does the personal story of the protagonist. The ending, despite the fact that it seems contrived, is watchable. Somehow the film manages to entertain - at least once."
Five Nights at Freddy's (2023),"Good, if you go into it with low expectations.","I didn't watch this right away like most fnaf fans, and was informed that it was going to be more like a comedy. Going into this movie with low expectations actually made the movie more enjoyable than it would have if I went in expecting a horror show. Overall, the movie was alright. This script felt kind of off, and all over the place, but the acting was actually alright, and the soundtrack was a total banger. The scariest part about this movie is balloon boy. That dude made me scream when he came on screen. This movie felt like a comedic treat to old fnaf fans, and I personally enjoyed watching it."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),Don't get the hype,"Idk, i thought this movie is good bcs the rating is high for horror movie. But after i watched, i got nothing want to say. Just the same as other mediocre horror movies. Teenagers did something stupid, got terror from demon, some characters dies, and just like that. And how they using make up for the demons is kinda basic i guess. They can make more disturbing make up for the demons, maybe i can add more high rating for this movie. I think they just wanna to save budget. And last, this movie never makes where this game appeared for the first time and how that can makes the devil summoned....."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),Great Concept Undone by a Terrible Protagonist,"The first half of this movie is incredibly effective with the concept of a bunch of teenagers having a real medium to communicate with the dead and filming themselves use it just for a laugh. Then one of their uses of the medium goes too far and problems arrive, that is great stuff. But everything that happens after the possession gone awry is a bunch of predictable nonsense. It also doesn't help that the main character is so unlikeable and selfish that you don't care whether she lives or dies. It is not properly established if she is being controlled by demons but that's the only thing that could excuse her terrible decisions which could have just as easily been driven by a selfish desire to speak with her mom above all other peoples safety. I didn't hate watching this but the potential was there for something great and it was just not executed well at the half way point."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),I was expecting more,"I should have known better than to expect some random Netflix horror to truly be excellent but based on the relatively positive reviews and claims how fresh the movie felt I was, admittedly, pretty optimistic going into it. What I got was okay, but I really don't see what's so special about this film versus every other spirit-communication-gone-wrong genre piece before this. On the surface this hand gimmick as the method of spirit communion seems fresh, but really it's just replacing the worn out Ouija board trope summons something evil with another communication mechanism. After that the rest of the movie falls in line with your typical story beats in relative lockstep. The final sin for me is the movie is frankly just not very scary. I never jumped, I was never creeped out, I was never really intrigued - but at least I was never really bored so there's that."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),"""I let you in""","I found this movie to be pretty effective in how it's executed. The story is interesting with teenagers able to contact spirits with a mysterious embalmed hand. I really like the idea of holding a mysterious hand to contact spirts and then say ""I let you in"" so it possessed that person. It really shows how it is a bad idea to do those types of things and how they affect someone. The movie is also a subject matter of grief and obsession with the main character losing her mother and wanting to contact her. It really shows how far someone can do in order to talk to a loved one again. The movie also works as a psychological horror with the main character struggling with her grief and obsession towards her mother and that hand throughout. It also affects her mental health and cause her to do some extreme stuff later on in the movie. The ending itself is pretty good on how it ends."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),A Refreshing and Enjoyable Horror Film with Strong Performances and Creative Storytelling,"Talk to Me is an incredibly enjoyable watch, offering a breath of fresh air for both the horror genre and filmmaking in general. As a true directorial debut from Michael Philippou and Danny Philippou, it stands out as a great success. The film introduces a new and creative idea with a fun and energetic style, although there are some minor bumps along the way. The immersive world-building captivates viewers instantly, evoking a sense of wonder. The characters, portrayed by a talented cast, are relatable with both their strengths and flaws. Sophie Wilde's standout performance handles complex emotions with finesse. The scares are well-executed, avoiding cheap thrills and are instead blended seamlessly into the narrative. While some moments may elicit a humorous reaction depending on the viewing situation, the overall experience is enjoyable. The film strikes a balance in exploring its storyline without overexplaining or underexploring, which I feel is a great choice. Certain sequences are difficult to watch due to some intense and gruesome violence; however, I believe that because the film makes you feel this way, it adds to the experience and showcases the brilliance of how the film is crafted. Overall, it was a great film, and I would recommend everyone give it a chance."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),Really high quality,This movie is a rare gem. It's been a long time since there was a horror movie this well made. Iam a big fan of really scarry horror. I can't stand artsy horror or slow burners. Lately that has been all that has been made. But this one stands out for real. A new take on the classic invited evil spirit. We follow a group that looses control. The tension builds up as all things goes south. It's refreshing with all of these never seen before actors. We get thrown between the different realities and its hard to know what is reality and what's not. This stands out as a really top movie these last years.
Talk to Me (I) (2022),"Good horror flick, nothing outstanding","I was really excited for this movie as it was quite hyped up. As soon as the movie was on discount, I grabbed it. The premise is pretty cool, it's sort of refreshing. Apart from that, the movie is your usual horror flick. It's a decent one, but not shockingly good or groundbreaking. You turn it off, think ""cool"", and it's gone. No longer in mind. If you search for a horror movie for people who're not used to watching scary movies, this will be a very good choice. In my view, it's not that good of a choice for horror movie fans - at least if you want something special, the cherry on your sundae."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),Those darn kids and their groovy party-drugs!,"The end of the year 2023 is approaching as I'm writing this user-comment, and - as usual - many website and magazines are publishing their annual ""best of"" lists and rankings. The Aussie made ""Talk to Me"" appears in practically every list, and quite high to boot, so I tried to squeeze it into my viewing schedule before the year is over. As too often the case, sadly, I must say I'm not overly impressed with it, although admittedly it does contain a few original elements and two or three genuinely frightening and shocking moments. One of the original elements is the basic premise. In ""Talk to Me"", demonic/spiritual possession is presented as the newest hype in party-drug sensation. Forget taking pills or sniffing gas. It's sufficient to grab the embalmed hand relic and say the titular words, and you go into a trance where you get hallucinations of the ghosts of random deceased people that make you do all sorts of crazy stuff. The spectators obviously film everything with their smartphones and put it on YouTube or Instagram. Evidently, this is bound to go wrong, and it does when teenager Mia learns that one of her friends gets in contact with the ghost of her dead mother during his trance. Mia breaks the ""rules"" of the possession's maximal duration, and it has extremely painful consequences for the medium. The idea is good, Sophie Wilde's performance is intense, and there are a couple of excruciatingly agonizing moments you won't forget very soon (featuring a teenager's face and a table), but there too many defaults and unanswered questions. For me, at least. Where does the embalmed hand come from? Why aren't there any adults aware of the new hype even though it's all around the internet? I'm sure these questions, and several more unasked ones, will be answered in a long franchise of sequels, prequels, spin-offs. I will watch those eventually, of course, but I was still hoping for a more satisfying original. In this genre, I liked ""Smile"" better."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),VERY Scary and creepy!,"I've heard that most YouTuber movies/horror movies (or whatever) AREN'T that good, but this one is actually AMAZING! (For a horror movie, AND a YouTuber horror movie). Positives: The movie is VERY creepy and VERY scary which obviously horror movies are SUPPOSED to be, sadly not all horror movies success by doing that. The movie doesn't focus that much on jumpscares but more fear and suspense, which i like A LOT. The acting in the movie is very good. Especially for teen horror acting/acting for a teen horror movie, and just acting in general. The movie is creative and the story is good. The movie has a good and unexpected ending. The movie has a good length. Not too long of a movie, not too short of a movie. The movie has a good main character who you can root for. The movie has good characters. The movie has a very simple concept. The movie is VERY good for being a horror movie. The dialogue in the movie is good. The movie is fun and enjoyable to watch. Negatives: This movie MIGHT work out as a sequel (yes, they are planning to do one) but a sequel might also NOT work out. I hope that you can understand why after you've watched this movie. The movie can be a bit slow sometimes but still good and enjoyable. Sometimes, but just SOMETIMES the acting can fall a bit flat."
Talk to Me (I) (2022),Stinker,"I was originally looking forward to this flic in that it had great reviews. The story seemed interesting with a lot of potential. Noticing it was Austilian didn't necessarily damper my intentions. Foreign movies (in English) can be harder to follow at times but still worth it. This was pretty much fast talking, jive talking gen Z hipster dialogue. Scares are far in between. Lots of boring crying and talking interspersed with sleeping, foot sucking, etc. Yeah I know there's a story here about pain and regret too, but it just doesn't seem to work. The screen play is to broken up. Maybe just to much fast jive talk or something. The very ending wasn't bad but getting there was tedious."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Abysmal,"So very bad. I'd rate this a negative score if I could. The script, the dialog and direction is so very bad. Such a waste of talented actors like Colin Farrell and Barry Keoghan, even Nicole Kidman. These ""artistic"" horror movies are all bad. The Witch, Hereditary, Midsommar and this trash are all alike. The stories and direction are awful and it's so hard to believe that anyone finds these movies remotely interesting. Let alone good. I won't watch another movie by Yorgos Lanthimos again. If you want to watch an odd film that was done very well, go watch The Banshees of Inisherin. Martin McDonagh is a masterful filmmaker that highlights the talents of all the actors in that film, Keoghan in particular."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),"Terrible, God Awful Movie. I wasted two hours I'll never get back","This was a god awful film. A terrible plot with so many holes, you're literally saying to yourself ""WTF?!?"" every 3 minutes. Nothing made sense, nothing was explained. The only reason why I kept watching was to see if they even answered any of the questions. And the answer is no. Watching this film will leave you frustrated, angry, tired, and jealous that you didn't watch literally anything else. I sincerely regret even trying to watch this movie. I only thought it might be worthwhile due to the actors attached to it, but I will never watch another Yorgos Lanthimos film ever, ever again. What a piece of crap."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Mixed Feelings [7.4/10],"My Reaction / Review for The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017): 20 minutes in and the movie has a really creepy vibe. Martin is obsessed with Steven, it seems unhealthy. Martin's mom started licking Steven's fingers, so awkward and creepy. I guess both mom and son are creepy. Martin thinks that his mom and Steven would be a great couple, that's so weird, Steven has a family and he is married. What happens to his son's legs? Martin wants Steven to kill a member of his family? He is nuts. Steven's daughter is in love with Martin? Thard disturbing, he is such a creep. Now Steven's daughter is sick too? I wonder if somehow Martin is responsible for this. Martin says to Anna that his mother and Steven have a romantic relationship? Such a liar. Steven's coworker, the anesthesiologist is a creep too it seems, disgusting. Steven is having a mental breakdown. Martin is now Steven's prisoner? I didn't see that coming, nice. The question still remains, how did the kids get sick? This family is completely falling apart. What the hell is Steven doing to his family? Is he about to kill them? He killed his son? What the hell was that ending? What's the meaning behind all of it? Why the kids got sick? Why Kim got healthy after Bob's death? Sounds like nonsense to me... Overall the movie is entertaining and disturbing but the ending ruined it for me. My rating is 7.4/10."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Total Mind-F,"This film is a total trip - can't believe I haven't heard of it until now. I felt it was hard to get past the stilted/robotic way everybody spoke in the beginning - I'm assuming that was purposeful. And there were small gaps in the story - which again, I'm assuming was intentional and was up the the viewer to sort out. Everything eventually smoothed out and the perceived iciness amongst the family and friends became easier to translate. I'm hit & miss w/this creator's past films and this film falls somewhere in the middle. However - the casting was expertly done and it's a true testament to Kenough's talents watching him play someone much younger than his actual years, and still scare the crap out of you. This actor is also new to my awareness and I'm 'chasing' his work so I can watch more of him. He plays such odd characters - all different in their own right - but all still odd. I have to wonder if he is actually ON the spectrum and that's what makes him and his mannerisms so unique."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Lanthimos perfectly presents a constant psychological horror and a fantasy drama with a a discreet biblical context and also based on Greek tragedy Iphigenia,"The film is a retelling of the Greek tragedy Iphigenia. In the text written by Euripides around 2,400 years ago, King Agamemnon kills a sacred deer during a hunt and thus incurs the wrath of the goddess Artemis, who demands a sacrifice from him: he must kill his daughter Iphigenia, or the winds will not leave the ships of the king to set sail to wage war in Troy. For Agamemnon, it was a very difficult, almost impossible choice. Lanthimos updates the dilemma (the first scene, of a heart beating during surgery, indicates in a very literal way that Steven takes other people's lives into his hands - more than he would like or feel prepared to do, in fact). Above all, the director renews the foundations of Euripides' text - in his own deeply uncomfortable, and also fascinating, way. The atmosphere established by Lanthimos around these characters has the desired instigating effect, however, unlike ""The Lobster"", in which the eccentricity of the ensemble still allowed space for broader issues to be explored - such as incommunicability, loneliness or brokenness. Of the pre-established concepts that guide romantic relationships - here the filmmaker offers an exercise in style that seems to end in itself. Something that would be valid if ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" was assumed as such from the beginning. The feeling that remains, however, is that, with each shot, Lanthimos aims for something much more complex. The erudite soundtrack, the traveling shots through the corridors, the enigmatic close-ups, the abrupt cuts, everything suggests a gravity, an air of importance, that never materializes. There is a clear attempt to impose a metaphysical meaning, see Martin's never-explained ""powers"", to this bourgeois guilt that befalls Steven's family, proving liable to divine punishment - the reaffirmation of the contrast of the Murphys' wealthy life with the boy's modest reality denotes this. However, such intentions never surpass the barrier of Lanthimos's provocative impetus, which ends up undermining the possibility of deeper reflections in favor of the need to create moments of shock, almost always effective, but often gratuitous - from the opening shot that shows a real cranioplasty to Alicia Silverstone's short cameo as Martin's mother. The tense climax, with echoes of ""Gratuitous Violence (1997)"", by Michael Haneke, whose latent nihilism exerts a great influence on Lanthimos, summarizes well the qualities and weaknesses of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". Because, despite being impactful at first, it ends up not resonating with the imagined force, leaving an almost indifferent void. The visual strategy of Lanthimos and director of photography Thimios Bakatakis contributes to the effectiveness of this strange universe, obviously, the constant use of wide angles that not only deform the scenes on their sides but also expand them in their depth, leaving the characters even smaller and more fragile (and the fact that they are normally displaced to a lower quadrant of the plane is another fabulous language resource). Lanthimos creates an aseptic, hollow universe that gives voice to the muted feelings he tries to convey, so that the most important feelings here-guilt and revenge-come into natural focus. His use of an extreme plongée on the hospital staircase where Steven works, after a still camera sequence, is particularly beautiful, poetically combining with the existential emptiness and apathy of Farrell's character. Embodying Kubrick, the director uses and abuses symmetrical takes and tracking shots which, despite functioning as what Americans would call eye candy, often do not seem to have greater functions than the decorations they are, which only contributes to distract the viewer and give a longer duration than the tape needed to be. Furthermore, sometimes the script devolves into excessively expository texts that break the subtlety of the narrative presented. Particularly unnecessary moments are those that expose the question of culpability, making obvious what had already been marked between the lines. These are, perhaps, the only moments in which Lanthimos bows to the ""need for explanations"" that permeates productions that intend to go beyond their market niche, something that also briefly marks ""The Lobster"". It's understandable and doesn't discredit the experience, but it's a habit that the director would do well to suppress in future works to embrace once and for all the weird and bizarre side, as in ""Dogtooth"". The first relevant point to consider here is that it hovers between psychological horror and a fantasy drama. The award-winning script by Lanthimos and Filippou is fundamental in the slow but progressive construction of this tension, at a pace of psychological horror: it is designed to never leave the audience relieved. Even though nothing is said explicitly, forcing the viewer to search their heads for explanations for what would be happening on the screen. It is very interesting how the dialogues gradually gain drama in their tone, as the characters, small and lonely in the midst of plans that oppress them, fall into despair. Only then do we realize that the film is the agonizing story of a reckoning that borders on the surreal - and karmic. Lanthimos chooses not to provide definitive answers about his proposal. However, without this harming the development of the given topic. Its direction is dry, direct, and does not fail to show violence. The soundtrack plays an important role, as at some points in the film it increases in volume until it becomes distressing to be in the armchair watching that situation. The dialogues between the characters are devoid of emotions. Lanthimos manages to reveal to the viewer how forced and even ridiculous the repeated dialogues between people are to the point of being empty words. When Martin, the dead patient's son, begins to demand more of Steven's presence, we realize that the film goes further, creating chaos in the doctor's life that begins a chain of questioning about the attitudes of all the characters present. The plot has great surprises that deserve to be preserved, so that the viewer can really get into it. Blood is an essential element in Lanthimos' film. It appears in the first scene, is mentioned as Kim's menstruation, is involved in violence, and even in the appearance of a simple ketchup. The blood refers to Christ, to the innocence of the sacrificed deer, at the same time as it is involved in violence between men. Science, in the context of the film, serves as a counterpoint to Nature: by using it, someone who should value life destroyed one out of ego and irresponsibility. Therefore, the entire film seems to be an angry response from Nature or from some undefined deity that charges those who act in the name of the illusory power that Medicine can give to control life. Ultimately, the film reveals a disturbing coldness in its characters' decisions. With a plot that involves the viewer in doubt about the sequence of events, in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" it is possible to be carried away by the anguish of trying to understand how fantastic the story goes and remain thinking about the film after the session. The film's atmosphere now has a discreet biblical context (hence the maxim ""God gives and God takes away""), but still maintains certain characteristics of a Greek tragedy (and the symbolisms that refer to the sacrifice and dilemma of a man in conflict are examples). Steven Murphy, as the man of science, is rendered powerless by being just a man in the hands of mysterious forces; His profession becomes useless in saving his family (a detail that is, to say the least, ironic). Martin, as a result, gains the image of an Old Testament God, charged with wrath. If his father died in surgery, Steven will then need to sacrifice someone (the ""sacred deer"") to balance everything. In fact, these details are absolutely interesting, as they are already anticipated through the wide-angle camera angles. She, at various times, remains above Steven, as if she were God. Perhaps Lanthimos' genius lies in making surgery the film's great metaphor (it is cold and precise). Not only is Steven as cold as his profession, but the film's atmosphere, soundtrack, dialogue and acting are also cold. Everything is cold, latent and little demonstrated. Any coldness is on purpose, as that is what the director wanted to create. Notice how everything, so inexpressive, ends up ""expressing"" terror and pessimism. Coldness is what defines ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". As stable, calculated and ""surgical"" as its system is, a simple crooked line or a crescendo of music can be the prelude to chaos. And this film walks a fine line. The film ends on the right note, almost with symmetry, matching the coldness of its introduction. The heart of the first scene connects with the sacrifice in the Murphy family (but in different senses). His conclusion indicates that Martin is the representation of God. In the last scene, he is sitting on a bench in a restaurant, and is not even seen by the Murphys (except for Kim, who gives him a look). He is like God: he is there, he is felt, but he is not seen. There is no more sacrifice, and that family no longer owes you anything. Everything then ends."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Why does everyone have Asperger's?,"We are pulled in by this odd pair, trying to figure out what their relationship is. It's intriguing but that's as good as the movie gets. As soon as we find out how they are connected the movie becomes pretty bland. Everyone in this movie speaks and acts like they have Asperger's. It was interesting at first to see them interact with a monotone voice and no filter but it starts to feel ridiculous the more the movie goes on. We never get any explanation as to why all the characters are so strange, they just are. There are some edgy scenes and dialogue strewn about the movie just for shock value. Such as the mom acting dead for her husband's necrophelia fetish or the dad telling his 9 year old son about how he gave his dad a handjob. The antagonist tells the father that his family will get sick and die unless he kills one of them. Okay, but how? Who knows. It wasn't poison so I'm left to believe that this kid can somehow influence these kids to think they are dying through the power of persuasion. The daughter is somehow still in love with him despite him actively killing her and her family. It's never explained why the mother never got symptoms. The movie could be cut in half with all the unnecessary crap in it. Barely anything substantial happens until the very end. There is no mystery because they literally tell you the answer half an hour in. There is no tension because until the kids' eyes start bleeding you know no one is going to die. I liked the way the family members started sucking up to the dad at the end. That brought some weight to the situation. The way he decided to choose who to kill at the end was ridiculous though. He could have fired 20 bullets before he shot one of them and even then he could hit them in a bad spot and cause unnecessary pain. Meanwhile his son is about to die and he is damaging his house for no reason. Could have just played Russian roulette. The soundtrack was good for the most part but at times it got overzealous and annoying. The acting was good. It's a well made movie but it's not a good movie. Just fine."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),"Good metaphora, bad movie","Ancient myth, disguised in American way of life. Good actors struggling to pull out some sense from the story. Maybe interesting for deeply religious, moderately intelligent and poorly informated people. I cannot understand poimt of view of Cannes Jurie board giving the prize for playwrite. Maybe in 2017 y. There were some sinister Sun activities which influenced the jurie decision. Technically, the movie is professionally made. Director is obviouslly real professional, but didn't went far from boring psychological, mild horror and plenty of sex obssesion mixture. Don't expect of me to warch this movie once more time."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),A potentially good movie that is bogged down by Yorgos Lanthimos's artistic pretensions,"Renowned cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Steven Murphy lives an idyllic life with his wife and two children. When he befriends a fatherless teenager named Martin, the young man proceeds to inveigle his way deeper and deeper into the doctor's life. Soon, Martin's dark intentions become apparent when Martin reminds him of a past transgression which will permanently shatter the domesticity of his household. The latest offering from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos who collaborates once again with Colin Farrell, whom he worked with on his equally idiosyncratic The Lobster. It is no exaggeration to describe The Killing of a Sacred Deer as a deeply surreal and perturbing look at a man whose family's life is turned upside down by an unstable teenager. Inspired by the ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides, like The Lobster, Lanthimos's movie is clearly experimental in nature in so much, as for reasons that appear only clear to himself his cast delivers their performances in a stilted and wooden style. The artificiality of this is only matched by Lanthimos's script which he co-wrote with Efthimis Filippou. It's pretty much robotic as if his protagonists escaped from the Stepford Wives. At the movie's heart, there is a good movie with a sublimely bizarre and surreal plot and Lanthimos manages to add a nuanced, somber and unsettling tone. There is something of a cold sterility to the Murphy household which may account for the unorthodox style of acting on display. Suffice to say that like The Lobster there is an underlying touch of the absurd to it's plot which no doubt owes a measure of debt to the avant-garde work of David Lynch, while there are hints of the Oscar winning psychological thriller Fatal Attraction. Barry Keoghan, who would later feature alongside fellow Irishman Farrell in the black tragicomedy does have something of an unsettling presence as well as a awkwardness about him as the disturbed young antagonist. However, Lanthimoas can't overcome the weight of his own artistic pretensions with the stagy style of his direction and the constrained acting by his cast bog it down considerably. Which is a shame because there was a potentially good if very strange movie that had the potential to be so much more than it actually is. Needless to say as well that the considerable talents of both Farrell and Keoghan feel wasted, and deserved better than what they are left to work with. And Nicole Kidman has done considerably better with the similarly off-kilter and dark Stoker, just seems to be infinitely bored with everything that's gone on around her. One has to wonder if her involvement is due to any artistic merit she thought the movie had or merely for the paycheck. Either way The Killing of a Sacred Deer feels like something of a missed opportunity from Lanthimoas whose seems to have fallen prey to his own overreaching ambitions."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),Ridiculous,"This is a terrible movie that it insists upon itself. A boy threatens a father's family and then stands by and does nothing. He doesn't report it. He doesn't try and stop him. He doesnt warn his family about the weird stalker. He just lets it happen. He is complete denial. The sound and screenshots make it feels like the director is trying to copy Kubrick's style at moments but is so completely off the mark it's insulting to his work. There is no value in watching this unless you're the type that likes to ""get"" pretentious works; sometimes referring to smelling one's own farts, though in this case it's the director's and it's thoroughly terrible but we're told it's good and therefore must will find a way to ignore our rationale mind and conform to what everyone else says or wonderful."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017),I created an IMDB account to give this movie one star,"I actually like weird movies, but this movie just stinks. I understand that it was probably an artistic decision or something for the director to tell his actors to show no emotion whatsoever, but it gets old so fast. The characters say some pretty off the wall stuff with no explanation whatsoever. The only silver lining would be the performance of the moon faced kid from Dunkirk....he was pretty creepy. I normally love Colin Farrell, but he was so off putting. Nicole Kidman just looked as confused as I felt watching this piece of garbage. There was some unintentional humor which I guess was a positive. When the son falls out of the hospital bed, when the daughter exclaims "" Dad Bobby is dying!"" When his nose starts bleeding. The climax of the movie when Colin Farrell has to make his heartbreaking decision was pretty hilarious to."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),"I am not an intellectual or a film critic, but I LOVED this movie!","Beau Is Afraid is shocking, confusing, gory and hilarious. It gives the viewer anxiety for sure, but breaks up the anxiety with plenty of ridiculousness and hard-to-believe action. I'm not sure I fully understand this movie, but I will recommend it and I will certainly watch it again. Another viewer called it a punch in the face. I feel like it's more of a punch in the soul. It's tragic, gross and offensive and I'm totally here for it. Every time you think it couldn't get more shocking, this movie ups the ante and leaves the viewer wondering out loud ""What the hell is going on!?!"" Do yourself a favor and watch it...twice."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),I'm afraid this movie is awful,"I'm afraid Ari Aster has lost the plot. I'm afraid he thinks he's some kind of genius, when he's anything but. I'm afraid his previous success has gone to his head. I'm afraid his movies are getting progressively worse. I'm afraid to think of how bad his next film will be. I'm afraid that Hereditary will be the best thing he ever does. I'm afraid his latest film is a cod-Freudian one note bore with nothing interesting in it. I'm afraid some people have decided Joaquin Phoenix is the next Marlon Brando, when he has about as much substance and acting ability as Adam Sandler. I'm afraid this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),Awful. Boring. Static instead of dynamic.,"This director has done some interesting movies but they all have a bit of boredom in them. With this flick, Aster drives a car so slow, he drives it Into the ditch. Phoenix is a fine actor but he needs material that is worthy of his skills. This is the case with this effort. It is too slow. Too measured. Too flat to excite, even in the smallest increments. I could only watch minutes at a time and returned to it several times to completion. It felt like a chore. This is not entertainment. It is revelatory. It is not profound. It is an indulgent exercise in tedium. The fine actors in this movie deserve better. And they should've known better before committing to this snooze fest."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),i'd,"Never admit i was entertained by this movie...if dali and bosch had a heart stopping nightmare, it would seem like a dream where you'd died while having sex and had gone to heaven, compared to this...it's brilliant in its relentless ability to keep coming up with a grotesque story, scene after scene after scene...
it's like looking into an open wound eons deep. And i just couldn't turn away...not because i felt there HAD to be a resolution to it all, but because it was just. So. FAScinating. By the way, this is, in no way, a recommendation. See it if you really feel the need, but...i will NEVER understand the motivation behind making such a thing. And this DOESN'T mean it's 'bad'...for what it is, it is VERY well done. On top of all that i said...it's THREE HOURS LONG! THREE...
it makes me question my sanity, that i sat through it...granted, not in one sitting...but it might even be WORSE that i kept returning to the scene of this plane crash..."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),Just no.,"I love Joaquin Phoenix, so I watched without checking. But really, WTF? It just goes on and on, and like Beau, you understand nothing. You wonder if there was a script. You wonder if there's a story. You start to wonder if it's even real. You hope the nightmare ends well. It doesn't. It's one of those non-ending endings. It's like the movie thinks it's cool and alternative in some way. It's not. And the underlying psychosis could possibly give you nightmares just from trying to understand. Believe me, I wanted there to be meaning, depth, or purpose. I wanted my face to stop looking as dumbfounded and confused as Beau's."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),Loops,"Oh my gosh it's brilliant, to a point. Watching this can only be equated to what I believe 500 cups of coffee, no sleep, and functioning mental illness combined would be like. Several times I actually stopped to rewind (or, whatever it's called now, I backed up a few frames) to rewatch what I just watched, shouting ""WTF just happened""...it's an adventure in madness, like a song with lyrics that take you from midnight through to 5pm the next day and you're still at the bar playing random jukebox tunes while everyone else has gone home. This movie, seriously the director or producer or maybe all of them...just said action and told the actors to just do or say whatever the heck they wanted to say or do. Joaquin does a great job being the guy he's supposed to be and if you know, you know. Unfortunately, amongst the madness some of the story really never gets there and it's one heck of a LONG movie to not quite get there. Hence, I have to stop at a 7. I wish future watchers luck...it's one heck of a ride."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),My favorite movie of the year,"'Course that's not saying much in 2023. But this movie would have stood out even if the year had been full of outstanding shows. Anyhow. Beau Is Afraid is a visual delight. Each scene is filled with more details than you can hope to take in let alone make an effort to integrate with the plot. Not that there's a plot. Or maybe there is. I'm honestly not sure. Phoenix is stellar, this is the sort of stuff that he excels at (as opposed to muddled portrayals of historical figures). He is constantly on the edge of panic and disconnection from 'reality' in just the right amount to make the character feel real enough to be relatable. Rather than farcical or outlandish or, heaven forbid, dour and boring. And this is absolutely necessary for the character to be able to skip from once surreal outing to the next without alienating the viewer. But the movie is work and the time does not flash by. It's more like a 3 hour mountain climb than a pleasure cruise. The viewer, however, is wonderfully and richly rewarded for his attendance. Hereditary was a masterpiece. But then Midsommar was a misguided, shallow disappointment and I was prepared to write Aster off as a one hit wonder. But Beau Is Afraid is clearly the work of someone who knows how to make a movie."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),It's the generational divide,"The whole movie is a giant metaphor for boomers vs. Millennials/generation x/gen z. I think it's great because the metaphors are so strong. Everything from the giant monster to getting lost in some random fantasy with hints of rip van winkle. I think a lot of people saw this as random or confusing, but I think it's very straight forward. You got everything from the younger generation just being angry and confused all the time...literally choking to death on gender colored paint. It's just a metaphor for nonsensical fads that they're tied up in. I'm still in awe of how awesome it all is. Ari's saying if you make it past the dumb confusing gen z fads and gender confusion (literally choking to death on it...something something ad nauseam), you make past the nearly indestructible military complex that gen z-ers cry foul to, you make it past the random faceless fantasy pretending to be your life's story, you make it past the big scary peen monster literally meant to scare you into not having sex (sex education wasn't a thing for the boomers). If you get past ALL that...and you think you're ready to start doing things...then you're too late. Too old. You get chastised for trying. And then your little boat capsizes in the court of public opinion (social media)- another thing that wasn't around when boomers were young. The movie even goes on to critique how his mother's skyrocketing profits have worked to create the current social situation of ultra violent streets and even his living situation...as it's her building. Pretty wild metaphors. I liked it a lot."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),Shall I call it a pinterest collage(?),"The director made a wonderful collage of Rosemary's baby and his previous two movies🤣(which were also collaged and montages from Rosemary's baby). By that I mean it is more like a story board at its early stage but without real development(It could be a wonderful uncanny movie). Sadly It was not what I expected... You don't need 3 hours to describe the fear of aggressive control and complicated relationship with family... SIMPLY doesn't need to especially without some specific contexts. The set is so general and ambiguous(don't tell me it is not) I guess ari wanted to convey one vibe and psychological into many different families. But apparently he didn't realise perhaps the difference is more than the common. A very cheesy quote but it is so true: All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
Beau Is Afraid (2023),Is There a Rating Lower Than 1?,"I feel bad for The reviewer who said he gave up over three hours of his life watching this. Didn't take me that long. I can't understand people who give these kind of movies a 7, 8, 9 or 10. Are we supposed to be moved by their intellect or feel that we are less than Intelligent or knowing because we find this stuff senseless? Joaquin Phoenix has always been edgy but these character actors think they are so avant garde doing this kind of crap. You would do yourself a favor and watch a foreign film which is animated and done in a language you do not understand. You will get more out of it than you will this total and complete waste."
Krampus (I) (2015),The Dark Magic of Christmas,"""Krampus"" (2015) emerges as a unique work by mixing Christmas horror with fantastic elements, revealing itself to be one of the most creative and well-executed approaches to this theme in contemporary cinema. The film skillfully incorporates a children's appeal by adding doses of humor at various moments, choosing to avoid graphic presentations of deaths or disturbing content. The script, in turn, carries out a solid construction of the family drama, developing the relationships between the characters masterfully, supported by excellent performances from the entire cast. The choice of blue photography, in contrast to the design of the monsters, including the iconic villain Krampus, reveals careful visual work that captivates the viewer. The production also stands out for constructing one of the most notable Christmas themes in horror cinema, dedicating itself with care to the creation of scenarios, festive references and, mainly, the Christmas message, consolidating the film as a reference in the proposal. The ending of ""Krampus"" is marked by boldness and surprise. Although the childish tone prevails, the balance in the direction is evident, which seeks to please both the adult audience with moments of horror and ensure a memorable experience as a whole."
Krampus (I) (2015),"""Like he had for thousands of years, Krampus came not to reward, but to punish. Not to give, but to take.""","FILM: 7/10. Returning to the 2015 film Krampus, I find Michael Dougherty, the maestro behind the delightfully twisted Trick 'r Treat, turning his attention to the holiday season. Much like his Halloween gem, Krampus serves as a refreshing counter-programming to the saccharine sweet Christmas fare, blending comedy and horror in a way that nods to classics like Gremlins. The family at the film's centre is well cast, each member contributing to the chaos in their own unique way. It's a dysfunctional family dynamic that feels authentic, adding an extra layer of relatability to the unfolding madness. There's a chemistry that makes their descent into holiday horrors all the more entertaining, with Adam Scott and Toni Collette barely containing their frustration at the family members descending on their home. Creature design is a standout feature, with the monstrous creations adding a touch of macabre whimsy to the Christmas setting. Dougherty successfully crafts a festive nightmare, where gingerbread men and demonic toys become unlikely antagonists in the battle for holiday cheer. Krampus is undeniably a fun film, leaning into its darkly comedic moments while maintaining a genuine sense of peril. The blend of horror and humor hits the right notes, creating an experience that's both chilling and amusing. It's a reminder that the festive season isn't always sugar and spice, but sometimes a dash of horror adds the perfect kick. As the credits roll, Krampus leaves you with a playful warning - if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you might just be doomed for life. It's a cheeky nod to the film's mischievous spirit, proving that holiday horrors can be a delightful gift for those who appreciate a bit of bite with their Christmas bark. A festive frightfest that keeps the holiday spirit twisted and thrilling.

Krampus (I) (2015),TOO CHILDISH FOR ADULTS AND TOO ADULT FOR CHILDREN.,"Too childish for adults and too adult for children. It's a quality mix of light horror and comedy. All star cast is fun to watch, particularly Toni Collette who is consistently great. The end makes you think and is the highlight of the movie. Synopsis:
While the holiday season represents the most magical time of year, ancient European folklore warns of Krampus, a horned beast who punishes naughty children at Christmastime. When dysfunctional family squabbling causes young Max (Emjay Anthony) to lose his festive spirit, it unleashes the wrath of the fearsome demon. As Krampus lays siege to the Engel home, mom (Toni Collette), pop (Adam Scott), sister (Stefania LaVie Owen) and brother must band together to save one another from a monstrous fate."
Krampus (I) (2015),"Worth a watch once, but not the classic i hope it could had been.","Had this one in my backlog for a while and its been 2 years since i wanted to kinda transition my Halloween horror movies season into a Christmas movies season but it just didn't occured. I really wanted to watch it this year tough and with Christmas coming i did just that on the 21st. Overall... not a bad movie, but nothing really special, yet fine for one watch. Its actually a comedy mixed with horror while keeping the Christmas atmosphere in full force. The Krampus monster himself is actually not that present. It revolves around all his minions wich all have special imaginative designs. That said they pretty much all CGI animated and they kinda look goofy at time. I guess they were inspired by Tim Burton in some way. The issue is im never sure if i should take this movie seriously or not. Is it supose to be a comedy or is it supose to be horror? Maybe its supose to be a mix of the 2 just like i think it is? Who knows. But its not ""that funny"" while its not scary at all. This one get the yellow heart only by a tiny little margin. Its best feature in my opinion is the snow storm, Christmas stuff and altough a bit goofy like i said, the creatures at least are pretty original."
Krampus (I) (2015),Make A Wish,"Be careful what you wish for
Because you might just get it
Hands down one of the best Krampus movies out there
Trust me I've seen more than my share of the bad ones
Is this movie scary ? I guess it depends on what you consider scary
I could see it being a good introduction to horror for younger kids
As a adult fan of horror I doubt anyone would find it scary
But it is wildly entertaining
My favorite moments in the movie
Come from when the gingerbread cookies attack
I think part of my problem with this movie is
The movie is PG 13 and because of that
I think it limits what you get to see what you get to see on screen."
Krampus (I) (2015),Christmas Cheer be Damned!,"Krampus takes the traditional holiday film and turns it on its head, as Santa takes a back seat to a more devious holiday creature. Starting off like your typical Christmas film, the plot quickly starts to send shivers down your spine as you realize this has much more in store. The story is fun and exciting, with a perfectly unsettling ending to top it off and keep with its creepier elements. The cast is comprised of familiar faces and some talented children actors. While they mostly maintain a fun ride, some of the jokes can feel quite cheesy or stale, with the dialogue being almost satirical at times. As a Christmas movie, it certainly has the holiday element, but as a horror movie, the fear and unnerving nature are some of the best parts. While I didn't expect much going in, Krampus delivers a delightfully eerie tale that I have found myself running back to, time and time again."
Krampus (I) (2015),Couldn't possibly be worse,"Was it all a dream? Let's hope so. I'm hoping that when I wake up tomorrow I will forget that I ever saw this trash. The story makes next to no sense and Oscar deserving parenting is on display at all times. I'm pretty sure parents that have at least four working brain cells between them don't send their daughter out during an emergency to check on some dopey boyfriend even if he lived next door. And if the dad was an actual eagle scout he would have learned proper firearm safety and not walk around with his finger inside the trigger guard like an idiot! I think the director came up with this story after chugging a few bottles of nyquil and letting the fever dream guide his fingers on the keyboard. It wasn't funny, it wasn't horror but I did find some entertainment in watching my fellow humans display the purest form of stupidity possible."
Krampus (I) (2015),A Modern Day Christmas Horror Classic,"Krampus is one of my favourite Christmas horror movies. Like many horror films, it was dismissed when it first came out for really inexplicable reasons, but I'm happy it seems to be getting a well-deserved reassesment. Because, what's not to love here? You have a truly AMAZING cast, with great performances from Adam Scott, Toni Collette (!), David Koechner, and even the kids, who are mostly pretty solid actors and do well with the material. It has fantastic practical effects that pay homage to Rankin Bass Christmas classics, only much darker and more twisted. The story is fun and creative, subverting the saccharine wish fulfillment of most Christmas tales, for one that has a child invoking a spirit that's almost cosmic in its power and completely unstoppable. I LOVE how Krampus is presented here as a villain; not just the awesome practical creature they made, but how much power he has and fear he induces. It's just fantastic. Not to mention this movie is FUNNY. It has a great sense of humour and doesn't take itself too seriously. It validates a lot of the feelings people have about the holiday season, mainly about having to share a table and fake smile for family members you wouldn't associate with otherwise and the cynical consumerism Christmas promotes. However, like all good Christmas movies, the message is simple: family matters. Making it work regardless of your differences matter. Just when you think the film settles for a sweet, uplifting ending, it delivers one of the most bleak, brilliant ones I've seen for a Christmas horror film. Yeah, Krampus is a ton of fun. If you need a break from holiday cheer, even if temporarily, check it out."
Krampus (I) (2015),A blast of stark holiday horror that beats out most kindred titles,"The foundations are tried and true, a scenario that's been the basis of many holiday films for decades: an abundance of outwardly unlikable characters, the false manufactured cheer of Christmas set against abject cynicism about the worst aspects of the holidays in modern life, minimal representation of innocence (usually the very young) amidst a cornucopia of cringe and dreariness. To that foundation, of course, we add in this case a frightful supernatural entity drawn directly from European folklore, and presto! - 2015 horror-comedy 'Krampus.' Mind you, in this case the genre label is a bit of a misnomer; there are stunningly few outright laughs to be had in these ninety-seven minutes, and the ""comedy"" descriptor speaks more to the fragments of wry, black humor that marginally lighten the horror. To that point, despite how the picture was marketed, this is substantially darker than I expected, with grim atmosphere and grisly violence exceeding what some straightforward horror sometimes achieves; modicums of levity can't begin to meaningfully touch the most dour facets of the movie. I do like it, but suffice to say that this is not what I anticipated. Sparsely peppered with quick-witted lines that provide counterbalance, the preponderance of the length is characterized by shrewd use of light and shadow, incredibly unsettling unnatural movement, sounds, or visions, a tense and acutely disquieting score, and superb art direction that very distinctly cements the bleak, brutal ambience. This is to say nothing of surprisingly strong violence, imaginative and unnerving creature designs, and excellent stunts and effects; the computer-generated imagery looks fantastic, and to whatever extent the digital wizardry doesn't blend into the filmed footage, this is an instance where the disparity rather adds to the experience. Even the sound effects are plainly outstanding and further the harrowing airs about the feature, not to mention the costume design, hair, and makeup. Filmmaker Michael Dougherty, and co-writers Todd Casey and Zach Shields, concocted a wonderfully twisted nightmare that warps familiar Christmastime themes and ideas into an invigorating thrill ride that at some points rather becomes hard to watch for just how unremittingly sinister and cheerless the concatenation becomes. 'Krampus' is fun, yes, but in a manner very much unlike how it was promoted and spoken of since before its release. The narrative is sharp, potent, and stridently gloomy through to the very end; the fact that it does manage to be earnest and impactful at the same time is genuinely impressive. Equally punchy scene writing keeps us firmly locked in while maximizing the harsh, charged energy and every feeling, and much the same can be said for Dougherty's keen direction. The length passes very quickly as the tale grows ever more severe, and if anything, the casting in this rarely funny horror flick of actors largely known for their work in comedies only heightens the gripping tone and accentuates how far removed this is from how it initially presents. Case in point, Toni Collette is not known for appearing in genre titles, yet like Ari Aster's masterful 'Hereditary,' this is an exception in which her participation serves to amplify the intended effect, and emphasize the underlying gravity. Collette, David Koechner, Adam Scott, Allison Tolman, Conchata Ferrell, Krista Stadler, and even young Emjay Anthony, among others, all give splendid performances of real range, nuance, and emotional depth while being perfectly suited to the gnarly cavalcade of violence that the film broadly represents. Truthfully, I had mixed expectations when I sat to watch; I assumed I'd enjoy 'Krampus,' but I wasn't sure just how good and worthwhile it would really turn out to be. I'm pleased to say that when all is said and done, it's even better than I could have hoped. I think the heavy focus on horror over comedy actually serves the picture well, for it's made more fully absorbing and satisfying in its darkness; not only are the scant lighter touches more consequential in turn, but it seems as if the writers worked overtime to make the comedy smarter (that is, both more intelligent and more cheeky). The end result of all this is a genre romp that manages to hit considerably harder than it would seem from the outside looking in, or from the outset. Crafted with utmost skill and well made in all regards, it's both entertaining and riveting, and handily surpasses most other movies that try to play at the same intersection of horror and holidays. I'm so very happy with just how good this is, and for anyone who is open to the amalgamation, 'Krampus' earns my very high and enthusiastic recommendation!"
Krampus (I) (2015),"A Funny, Frightening & Unique Christmas Classic!","I wasn't sure going into this movie but decided to give it a full watch and I'm glad that I did! This movie is far from the typical cliche Christmas movie. Mixed with some humor & terror. If you like Christmas, horror & comedy all in one than you'll really enjoy this one. The writer really did a great job putting this one together. No, it's not like it's Oscar worthy but it's definitely one of those movies you could find yourself watching over & over again every Christmas season. This one gave me a bit of the chills and caught me off guard quite a few times & the ending definitely left me thinking about it well after it ended. Highly recommend you give it a watch."
Midsommar (2019),Meh,"Naturally, I can appreciate that any persons Taste In film is subjective, for me however it just felt like someone had watched, and enjoyed the Wickerman, afterwards then wanted to make a film were a bunch of stuff happens in a similar vain, to a group of characters I didn't care about. Personally, I wouldn't watch it again. But other people I know, absolutely love this film, and it came very highly recommended. Again, doesn't make it a bad film, just ended up being I personally didn't enjoy. May one day give it another punt, but certainly won't be today, or for a while. But each to their own."
Midsommar (2019),Nonsense don't waste your time,"What a nonsense garbage, boring from the beginning to the end, and I have seen a lot of movies that are garbage but this tops it. I get it's a movie but like none of the characters have a brain or what is happening to them or their friends, just shows how silly humans are when it comes to cults but I guess it the writers you can blame for the lacking in that department, still not sure what happened in the end I guess she really did join a cult just because what she been through just made sense for her to feel belonged and have a home these people give it her, I thought it would went other way around but still Don't waste your time."
Midsommar (2019),Best psychological movie to ever exist!,"I watched this film for the first time in summer and it was a great experience. Florence Pough (sorry if I spelt her name wrong) acted very well from the very beginning and deserves several awards from this performance alone. This is easily the best psychological horror film I have ever seen. Watching it for the first time was oddly comforting due to the aesthetics and vibrant colours, however as the movie went on it became more and more disturbing. The acting in it was incredible and I loved the plot. If you're looking to watch a psychological horror that feels summery, I would recommend this film! (Also a quick warning: don't watch this while high - you will regret it)"
Midsommar (2019),Magnificent camera work recalls Kubrick,"For the last two months I've been doing the Marvel marathon, 20 movies so far. They're almost all worth watching if in the mood, but the lack of stillness in the camera, the constant cuts, quick quips, punchathons and artificial visuals get tiring after a while. Midsommar is a fine antidote: the camera is beautifully still or slow. Editing-cuts are far less frequent, allowing more time to sink into an image. The compositioning of images is masterful: photography-like. Indeed, Kubrick-like (who was initially a photographer). We also get an impactful soundtrack, excellent acting especially from the lead, good script & screenplay with plenty of quality dialogue-free sections, effectively spare FX with realistic psychedelic 'breathing' visuals, and a riveting foreboding atmosphere. There's also very weird humour, which actually made me & my lady laugh out loud a few times....tho' I imagine others might just find it weird. The film slightly drags in the final third (I watched the theatrical cut) and some of the character reactions will have you questioning its realism. The plot itself is fairly predictable...we've seen such films before. These are nitpicks as we also get a handful of strong memorable scenes. Overall a decent 8/10. Feels like a worthy tribute to 1973's The Wicker Man."
Midsommar (2019),Lol,"Lol.. OK I've put off watching this one now for like forever, mainly coz in my head I already predicted what it was about and the sort of vibe it would give off ( like moods in other films) and unfortunately I was 100% right. I will say in the first quatre or even less than that we get to see some beautiful scenery ( I will have to read up where it was filmed locations etc) and I did like the lead actress, she held the most potential.. and for a moment with the beautiful scenery I thought I might have made a wrong assumption on how the mood and theme of film would go & I'd be in for a nice viewing. Unfortunately none of the rest of the characters went anywhere. Even their friend who had taken them for a trip. It seemed like we d get more from him but then he quietened off. But first and foremost. The place just SCREAMED Cult as soon as we arrive in the village but like I said some nice scenery I was interested to see where it went. But unfortunately you'd really have to suspend belief too far on this, especially in regards to reactions and decisions. The film is long and slow paced aswell, making it even more unbelievable, they wouldn't of all just fled, especially after the mountains viewing & no1 would believe the London guy ditched his girlfriend & if I was her I would have clung to the Americans. This is where at least something like Hostel is rational in thinking YO!! Time to go!! Before even first person goes missing. It just became to anti climatic and stupid after the beautiful scenes and initial sacrifice. It was beyond predictable & I honestly feel they wasted a opportunity for a better film in their."
Midsommar (2019),Didn't do it for me,"'Midsommar' (2019) Opening thoughts: It took me a long time to get round to watching 'Midsommar', due to not having time or the opportunity to watch it easily. Have always appreciated the genre it fits in, where there are many great films, and Florence Pugh showed a lot of promise seeing her for the first time in 'Little Women'. That it was also directed by the director responsible for the very good 'Hereditary' intrigued me too. The premise was one of those could have gone either way ones, it was advertised bizarrely and the critical reception was very polarising, particularly from those that didn't like it. After seeing 'Midsommar', count me in as somebody who didn't care for it. It is not an awful film and there are things done right, including an intriguing start, but the second half was a bizarre and tedious mess, so this viewer is this case more understanding of those who didn't like the film than liked. This has absolutely nothing to do with not understanding what 'Midsommar' was going to be or going for, quite the opposite, the issue is that it doesn't achieve its aims very well at all. Good things: 'Midsommar' does have good things. It is a very well made film visually, with photography that is both dreamlike and nightmarish in all the necessary places. The scenery is also absolutely beautiful, while also with a suitably ominous atmosphere. Did think too that the film started off well, with an unsettling opening that was creepy and suspenseful. The sacrifice scene was similarly suitably horrifying, with it being the scariest (and goriest) the film got. Regarding the acting, to me it was quite good considering what was given to them (which actually come to think of it wasn't much). Pugh anchors the film beautifully in a compellingly tortured lead performance. Bad things: However, there are also a lot of drawbacks. Most of the characters are incredibly thinly sketched and behave annoyingly and/or illogically. Pugh has the only character that has any development or who is interesting. Some friends thought that Will Poulter's character had the most personality, to me actually he was annoying and his presence jarred with the rest of the atmosphere. The direction did have some slickness but got very slack and muddled later on the more weird the second half became. The script has nothing memorable, is very stilted and can fall into self-indulgence. The story and pacing are the weakest aspects of 'Midsommar'. The story starts off with great atmosphere and intrigue, but post the sacrifice scene any creepiness and sense of horror pretty much completely goes. Meaning that the second half is incredibly long winded, this out increasingly (at times non-existent) and is bizarre to the point of near-incoherence. Especially the dragged out and truly daft climax that ends on an abrupt, incomplete feeling note and one of the silliest and most unintentionally funny sex scenes in recent years. Some of the intended creepy behaviours of the cult were potentially unnerving and sounded it on paper but were under-explored and/or left as loose ends or implied. A much shorter length definitely would have helped the pacing and atmosphere, the film is overlong and could have easily been trimmed by 25-30 minutes which would have tightened the pace. Which would have been achieved if scenes were made shorter and if motivations went into more detail. Closing thoughts: Overall, underwhelming. 4/10."
Midsommar (2019),I wanted to love this....,"I loved the directors previous film Hereditary. It was fresh if perhaps a bit bloated at times but it worked due to the plot's structure. So I was pretty stoked for this one. How many pure day light horror films are there? The Wicker Man (original) of which this film pays homage too, basically remakes it. And that is where ultimately, I was disappointment. First the good: The film is beautifully shot and minus 2 scenes the entire thing takes place in bright green fields of Sweden (shot in Hungary) It accomplishes merging beauty with horror in a way I haven't ever seen before (The Flower Dress) If you're a gore hound beyond just ""MORE GORE!"" then you may find certain scenes shocking (the cliff scene) as I did. It's not overly gory but with a background so beautiful for the heinous actions by both villagers and visitors it's quite jarring. There is also a suicide scene that raises a good question regarding how we ""civilized"" people tend to push our old/sick into institutions never to be seen again. Who are visitors to judge the customs of these ""sacred"" people? Sadly that theme is not explored and I found every character minus Dani to be interchangeable in their terribleness In closing. It feels like the director was, poorly, trying to remake the ultimate cult classic using the same methods that worked so well for his previous hit that what we end up with is a film that is
100% predictable from start to finish. In other words I found it boring. I wanted to love it but didn't. I am very happy it was made as I think Ari Aster is an incredibly talented director who knows how to bring the terror and I look forward to his next work. I just hope he tries something unique and fun to watch. TLDR: This film follows the themes of Hereditary with zero twists, and while it is a gorgeous (and morbid) work of art- I didn't like it or hate it."
Midsommar (2019),Weird and sometimes scary in the scandinavian midnight sun,"This was a weird, but entertaining horror flick, that popped up on my danish TV app. As a dane, and thus a real life neighbor to the swedish settting in the film, it was quite entertaining to watch this Hollywood take on Midsommar, that pagan leftover in swedish culture, something that we danes no longer celebrate. The film is quite uneven and requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. Some scenes and traditions of the Hågra are too random to not have set off our protagonists in real life. Said protagonists are paper thin in the film, it's all about the Hågra and the setting. I will say this film is interesting from a scandinavian perspective, because it features a lot of swedish actors and a lot of blonde people. This still being normal here, particularly in places like rural Sweden. However, from an american point of view, that is increasingly diverse, I can see how this ""land of the blondes"" might seem very foreign. I found this reverse exocitism interesting to think about. Overall, I found the movie unnerving in parts, humorous in others. Well worth a watch."
Midsommar (2019),Strangely Enjoyable,"I'm not surprised by how divisive Midsommar is. It is a trippy, 3 hour horror movie, that's more weird than scary, but has excellent cinematography, an amazing performance by the lead (Florence Pugh), and impressive attention to detail. But you've obviously seen my rating and know that I enjoyed it, so let's talk about this film. Firstly, I'll note that I rarely leave reviews for films I watch. In fact, it's almost 10PM and I need to get to bed, but this film left me thinking. The first thing I noticed about this film was the amazing performance by Florence Pugh as Dani. We really get drawn into empathizing with her early on. And not just because of her intense loss at the very start of the film (shown in a brilliant opening sequence I might add). Her amazing performance only continues on until the final smiling shot. Another thing I thought was wonderful about this film was the foreshadowing. First, the depiction of a ""love story"" in which the woman serves a man food with her pubic hair and a drink containing her period blood. Then, the moment when Christian takes a drink and then we see his drink is a darker, redder color than the rest. That realization only forecasts what is to come for him. But there were tons of other moments of foreshadowing. The bear. The joke that no one lives past 72. And my favorite, a subversion of prior foreshadowing. Earlier in the film pair of elders arrives at the feast and everyone else waits to sit and eat until they do. They jump to their deaths moments later. Similarly, Dani as the May Queen goes through the same feasting ritual. And this makes us fear for her even more. And this brings me to another strength of this film, keeping us in suspense. The best example of this is when they cut away before Dani makes her selection of who will die. The movie takes its time marching people into the ""temple"". But not Christian. Only when we later see Christian in the room with the disemboweling of the bear do we start to suspect something is off. And the last huge strength I'll talk about is the theme. This film explores the themes of loss, trauma, and letting go. And I think it does a wonderful job thinking through these issues, mainly through the character of Dani. Everything tells us that her relationship with Christian is doomed to fail: from his distance and gaslighting, to the contrast between them and the Simon/Connie duo, to the fact that he's obviously hoping to ""mate"" with Maja. And yet, we struggle alongside her as she fails to let him go until the final shot. So yes, this is a very strange film. It is definitely not for anyone looking for supernatural hauntings, slashers, or another hollywood franchise. But if you are willing to try something different and have the patience and the open-mindedness to accept the strangeness as it comes, you might just find yourself having enjoyed one of the weirdest films you've ever watched."
Midsommar (2019),"What a beautiful, inspiring tale. And there is SO much of it.","When the credits were rolling, my heart was lifted. This is a movie we don't get often. A movie about community, about empathy. A movie about the importance of traditions, and even religion. Most of all, it's about sacrifice. Be warned, though: this film takes its time. If you want something more action-paced, I recommend the very similar-themed, but less lenghty The Wicker Man. The one from the 70s. This is not about thrills. The ending is clear, long before you get there. As I said: This movie REALLY dares to take its time. Don't expect too much tension, because although it might feel tense, sometimes, it also lasts long enough - and then some - to ease out any of these feelings. God, this is such a good movie about values."
When Evil Lurks (2023),"It doesn't matter what you read (good or bad), you must watch it.","People complain all the time everything is a marvel sequel, or a disney remake. Well, this is different, bold, new, fresh. The movie is good and it has rare elements and moments that will haunt you even after watching it. Same as ""Terrified"", the previous film by the director (there are still scenes I can't erase from my head even after years of watching that one too). There's a lot of gore, but REALLY graphic, if you're easily impressed, it's probably going to be uncomfortable for you. Some images I'm having a hard time getting them out of my head. The movie doesn't stop, it's not like those films that have like 30 minutes of boring character development. It starts and it keeps going and you'll get to know the characters as the movie progresses (great tip for filmakers nowadays, full of viewers with short attention span, A. K. A. Tiktok syndrome). It's a small town story. Solid performances, solid practical effects, decent story. Spanish speaker or not, if you're a horror fan you must watch this one."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Some of the best horror I've ever seen.,"This is a seriously scary and effective horror film. I trudge through so many mediocre horror films to find the random truly great horror masterpieces...and for me at least, When Evil Lurks is absolutely one of the new horror masterpieces. The story and world created are so expansive, it kept me wondering what else was going on in this mad-scary world...so much backstory to flesh out and places it could go now with the story...so much more to learn about the Rottens and the Cleaners, etc! I'm now going to search out other films directed by Demián Rugna...while I eagerly await to see where we go next in the When Evil Lurks story."
When Evil Lurks (2023),A Tale of Unfulfilled Promise,"""When Evil Lurks"" introduces a truly special concept that had the potential to make it the standout movie of the year. The first half of the film is captivating, drawing audiences in with its intriguing storyline and well-executed suspense. The innovative idea behind the movie succeeds in creating a unique atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Regrettably, the second half takes a disappointing turn towards predictability and monotony, diluting the initial excitement. The film's potential for chaos and innovation hinted at in the beginning falls flat, leaving viewers yearning for a more dynamic and ambitious portrayal. In envisioning the film's potential, one can't help but wish for a reimagination of the concept in a grander setting, such as a bustling city engulfed in possession-induced chaos. Despite its shortcomings, ""When Evil Lurks"" sparks hope for a future revisit, one that could realize the thrilling experience promised by its exceptional concept. I would have given 5 out of 10 but I really hated the second half."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Overhyped for it's shock value,"This film has been overhyped as one of the best horror movies of the year. I went into it expecting to be blown away and I was let down. Yes, this film has some crazy scenes that I enjoyed for how gory they were. But a good film cannot be dependent on shock value. And that's all this film was. It had a couple crazy moments but the in-between wasn't as interesting. The characters and the story wasn't compelling enough to hold my interest. I kept checking the run time waiting for it to be over. It was a bit different from typical possession movies but it wasn't far off. There were rules that had to be followed to deal with the possessed but the film doesn't take advantage of the rules it made. The film could have shown why each rule should be followed. There also weren't any high tension moments or even any scares. The film became more disappointing towards the end with the use of the children inside the school. It just made for a weak ending."
When Evil Lurks (2023),The Best Horror Film for YEARS,"When it comes to horror When Evil Lurks delivers on every count, whether it is atmosphere or gore, this movie holds back nothing. I had meant to watch this film for some time, as I had only heard good things about it, so I finally sat down today to watch it. I was not left disappointed. This film delivered everything I had been waiting for from a new horror film, apart from the scares, but that is not the film's fault. I am desensitized to horror. So I am sure it holds many nail-biting moments for most. I can't fault anything, the acting was fantastic, the locations and the special effects. You need to watch this film. Yes, it has subtitles, but people need to get over that. There is a world of foreign horror out there that deserves to be indulged in. One warning though, if you can't handle horror/gore involving children then this probably isn't the film for you."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Didn't understand,"I watched this movie without text. I don't know Spanish. Just the gist of it got me the creeps. The first part of it was so discusting that I grap my mouth. I am sorry that I didn't know what that was about, but I think that old lady was trying to keep the evil contained. Correct me if I am wrong. She really begged him not to shot this discusting creature. I know that I would have shot it. But that is just me. The first half was really discusting and threw me off. I still thought I was following the point. The only thing that was ruining it for me were the painted kids. The were not believable."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Dissapointing,"I do not understand people who are raving about this film. It has good ideas for sure, but everything was executed so poorly that it reminded me of a high school production with cheap makeup and overacting children. The acting is horrific. Everyone was screaming at the top of their lungs, which was highly annoying. The main character is probably the most stupid person you'll ever see in horror movies. The production looks extremely cheap. Child actors obviously cannot act. The lore is not explained. There is no sense of horror at any point, and there is a happy end because everyone stops screaming, and you are just relieved."
When Evil Lurks (2023),"Disjointed, loose, disappointing","Unpleasant characters who garner no sympathy, combined with a loosely constructed plot, make this movie difficult to watch. There are many positive reviews of this movie on IMDB, so this review is in the minority. How one reacts to a movie is subjective of course. But an objective fact is that the writer and director of this movie are the same person. Far more often than not this kind of arrangement results in excesses and shortcomings, presumably because there is no one to check or balance the work of the other. I saw this movie's score among fans so I had high hopes. (I never read the ""critics"" anymore.) This movie was a disappointment I'm sorry to say."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Good movie ruined by the ending,"I was ready to recommend this movie to all my friends until I saw the last 10 minutes of it. Those last 10 minutes ruined the movie for me. A typical example of the cliche trope of the main character making the worst possible choice even though he knows better, but the movie plot needs to happen so he has to do the worst thing imaginable which does not suit the character at all. So if you can stomach a trash ending, then I recommend this movie to you. It has really good moments, but again, be prepared to have one of the most unsatisfying movie endings in any horror movie to date. A shame really."
When Evil Lurks (2023),Tense horror movie with interesting premises that unfortunately does not deliver a satisfying ending.,"I enjoyed the premise of ""When Evil Lurks"", I think that it is an original possession story, that part ways with the usual stereotypes of this kind of horror. The evil takes over the lives of Jimi and Pedro slowly and painfully. The audience assists to this inevitable ascent of the darkness that multiple times outsmart the characters, despite all the precautions and strategies that they apply. The director took a realistic approach and some elements of the story are raw and credible. There is no unjustified over the top violence and no pointless jumpscares. The script takes the time to deepen the backstory of Pedro and his family, making him vulnerable and relatable to the eyes of the audience. The narration is fervid and there are many tense sequences that deliver some unexpected moments. This is in my opinion what made the first half great. Unfortunately the film starts to lose its appeal midway. All the tension that built up completely disappeared in the second part of the film. The protagonist takes impulsive decisions that have no logic and that will cost him dearly. In my opinion this goes against the nature of the character, that from the beginning constantly warns others how to kill the possessed, without contracting the curse. The ending is very dramatic and it leaves things open for a possible sequel (that most likely will not happen). Overall I liked the general concept of this film, but the director (who is also the screenwriter) made some decisions that prevented this film from achieving its true potential. ""When Evil Lurks"" could be one of the best 2023 horror movies, but unfortunately it only gets a 6. It is still a solid film, but I was expecting way better."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),"Ridiculously over the top, but had its moments.","I enjoyed watching it, but damn there were a lot of absolutely asinine moments and ridiculous events. I knew it was going to be stupid going in, so I told myself to ignore all the stupidity and enjoy the movie. Parts were good. Statham is always fun to watch, and the other leads were quite good, except the actress who played his daughter. Maybe not her fault, maybe her dialogue and and her role in the film. The Megs were actually well done as well as the other critters. And the action was quite fun at the beginning. And the overall production values were quite good to excellent. Parts were amusing, the dislogue was mostly fun. But, it kept getting more and more ridiculous. Both the stunts and the actions characters takes. For example, three Megs were chomping up tourists in a harbor. Meanwhile, his daughter was in a life guard tower watching the events in horror. She spots a lady struggling 100 feet offshore. She apparently has time to climb down the 40 foot tower, get to the beach, find a surfboard, paddle out to the women before she drowns or gets eaten by one of the ravenous Megs. And of course they don't chomp her as well. The way he kills the Megs is preposterous, but fun if you can manage to overlook how preposterous. It's hard to do, very hard to do. If you like Sharknado movies, this is a couple steps above those:)"
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),Average sequel in which Jason Statham and friends must now face a terrible old enemy for the second time,"Thrilling film in which a scientific team goes horribly wrong, releasing the deadliest ocean predators that have ever roamed the seas since prehistoric times. Jonas Taylor: Jason Statham continues to dedicate himself to the environmental care of the oceans and collaborates with the Hainan Oceanographic Institute, China. In this place, Haiqui, a female megalodon that the director of the center intends to train, is kept imprisoned. Technological advances are evident, and now the team of marine ecologists can embark towards the unknown depths of the sea, however when the underwater expedition begins, Haiqui escapes. Then a trench and a malevolent mining operation that explodes free extinct vicious carnivorous animals causing bloody events with lots of gory scenes. As the deep-sea scientific team encounter the largest ferocious marine prehistoric predator that has ever existed - the Megalodon and in its own way wreaking havoc. Get ready for the ultimate adrenaline rush this summer in ""Meg 2: The Trench"" !. Dive into uncharted waters with Jason Statham and global action icon Wu Jing as they lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean! Immerse yourself in the most electrifying cinematic experience of the year with ""Meg 2: The Trench"" - where the depths of the ocean are matched only by the heights of sheer, unstoppable excitement !. New Meg. Old Chum. Back for seconds. There is always another one. Terror has never run this deep...Fear runs deep. You already know that this movie is about a prehistoric mega-shark rising from the depths and terrorizing the scientists crew. An inferior and literally larger-than-life thrill ride that supersizes the 2018 blockbuster and takes the action to higher heights and even greater depths with multiple massive Megs and so much more. It's a so-so action monster monster movie with a creepy creation of tension , thrills , terror and lots of bloody attacks. The released prehistoric man-eating Megalodon that joins with others of the same species deliver the goods, as the swimmers become their next meal while the scientists must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food. Here our heroes and heroines pitted against colossal Megs, gigantic octopus, huge toothy monitors and relentless environmental plunderers, our heroes must outrun, outsmart, and outswim their merciless predators in a pulse-pounding race against time. This is a peculiar rip-off to classic Jaws (1975) by Steven Spielberg and Piranha (1978) by Joe Dante, taking parts here and there of these films . Stars Jason Statham giving his ordinary acting as a two-fisted veteran deep-sea rescue diver must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below. If you liked Jason Statham in the first The Meg movie, you will enjoy this follow-up with the iconic actor doing his thing, and facing more monsters than ever. The hunk starring is well accompanied by a fine cast , such as : Jing Wu, Sienna Guillory, Cliff Curtis, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Skyler Samuels, Melissanthi Mahut, Whoopie Van Raam, Kiran Sonia Sawar, among others. The motion picture was mediocrely and with no originality directed by Ben Wheatley (The ABCs of Death, Tourists, Rebeca, High Rise, Doctor Who, In the earth, Free fire). The first ¨Megalodon¨ (2018) by John Turteltaub with Jaon Statham, Bingbing Li, Rainn Wilson, Cliff Curtis, Ruby Rose , Winston Chao, Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy , Darri Ólafsson, Robert Taylor, Jessica McNamee and Masi Oka has already created a mini-subgenre with imitations and rip-offs about this prehistorical animals , though some of them had been previously made , such as : ¨Megalodon (2002)¨ by Pat Corbitt with Robin Sachs , Al Sapienza, Mark Sheppard.¨Shark Attack 3: Megalodon¨ (2002) by David Worth with John Barrowman, Jenny McShane, Ryan Cutrona. ¨Megalodon¨ (2018) by James Thomas with Michael Madsen , Caroline Harris. ¨Megalodon Rising¨ (2021) with Tom Sizemore , Wynter Eddins, O'Shay Neal . ¨Bigfoot vs Megalodon¨ (2021) by BC Fourteen, among others."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),Horrible.,"I don't think there is much more to say. Horrible. Pathetic. I just don't understand why garbage like this get made. The makers shou be embarrassed. The movie continues to get worse every minute it plays. The science has to be explained because how dumb it is
I usually like Jason, he was about all the film had. Story is horrible.. Story is horrible.. Story is horrible
CGI is really really bad. Like cartoons. Save yourself the money cause it's not worth spending money on this one. Or watch it,,, and give it a review. Maybe someone will read it and feel bad for making the movie. I wish it was as good as the first one."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),What toxic waste has risen up from the depths of the Trench this time?,"Meg 2: The Trench has no brains but a lot of balls to be as batshit crazy as it is. I don't know how else to say it. It's one of those sequels that has twenty ideas for a story and uses ALL of them. It features not just one giant prehistoric shark but three of them. Plus a kraken sized octopus. And we got creepy little dinosaur-like reptiles scurrying about. There's even an early scene that is clearly meant as a 'take that' to JURASSIC PARK. Bold as brass, says I. The story picks up years after the first movie and Jason Statham is raising the precocious daughter from the first movie on his own while still keeping an eye out for those pesky Megalodons. But an evil businesswoman is illegally exploiting the mega sharks' territory for profit (the fiend!!!) and now there are more megalodons plus other prehistoric monsters swimming loose towards the surface. Ben Wheatley directed this movie and he's done movies that I liked quite a bit like High-Rise and Free Fire. What I gathered from those movies was his dark sense of humor and to his credit, that remains here. There is a lot of civilian casualties in this movie and I respect that. And there's a few death scenes that are surprisingly brutal for a PG13. I can't say this is a project for thespians or method actors to get involved in. But some people know what movie they're in and are having more fun than usual. Especially Page Kennedy. He got some laughs from me. Jason Statham is one of those actors who it's hard to tell if he is bored or if it's just the accent. But he's not terrible in this, I guess. Sienna Guillory is laughably bad as the evil CEO who keeps making bad decisions that only serve to get herself killed. There is some crappy dialogue in the script though. Look not for a monologue on par with Quint's USS Indianapolis speech in JAWS or the lunch debate in JURASSIC PARK. Expect a lot of one-liners trying to be quippy but instead a lot of them are quite pithy. Though if it's Statham saying it, it's a little bit cool. As incredibly weird and goofy this movie is, there are some cool action scenes to be had. When you can see them. The trench scenes are darkly lit and it is hard to see. But once the action moves to the surface and on land, it is easier to see and more fun to watch. Especially with the different monsters that show up in the third act. This movie honestly felt even more of a throwback to the schlocky B-movie creature features we got in the 1990s than the first movie was. For better and for worse."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),The Fast X of shark movies,"This was a waste of time. I watched it on Netflix so it's not like I saw it in theatres or anything, but still. It was a never-ending mess of absurd nonsense. The beginning with the dinosaurs and the infiltrating of the cargo ship scenes were pretty enjoyable, but from there it quickly fell off the rails. I lost enthusiasm with the megalodon in captivity, because we can't even keep great whites in captivity. And then, the trench part. It's an ""unexplored trench"" and you expect me to believe that there's a whole mining base already underway down there, ran by the boss of the whole ocean discovery company? Also, the fact that they see more Megs and are immediately like, ""cool, more Megs, let's follow them!"" Like do you not remember what happened last time? Those underwater dinosaur guys were a dumb addition too. Dinosaurs need air to survive so it kind of doesn't make sense that they've been hiding down there away from human eyes all this time. Then there's this random giant octopus that comes out of NOWHERE and escapes through the whatever-it's-called ocean layer with the three Megs and attack a resort island with the most creative name ever. Are you ready? Fun Island. My baby cousin could have come up with that. So the sharks and the octopus attack Fun Island and the big shot bad guy last and her Spanish mercs are there for some reason and so obviously they get killed by the little dinosaurs. And so our pal Jason Statham and his eco-warrior posse complete with a guy with a big Desert Eagle among other things in his pack that can manage to kick two bad guys in the face despite being pretty out of shape. Sure. Then the Megs are killed by Jason on a jet ski he stole with some homemade stick bombs and a helicopter bomb(because of course every underwater researcher can fly helicopters) and they save the world. The end. Don't watch. Seriously, don't. The original was cool because it was new and unique. This is just taking that movie and mating it with a Fast and Furious movie."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),Its a fun movie. Science.....who cares?!,"Look, I don't know what people have as far as expectations for the movie industry these days, but all I expect is to be entertained. I was entertained. This movie was fun and although it was not as good as the first movie, it was still entertaining to watch. Yes, the X could've been better, but seeing is though this is a megalodon shark movie I give it some grace for jumping the shark. No pun intended. I did not come into this expecting it to be scientifically, correct if you come into this movie expecting that you are setting yourself up for failure. Just sit back. Relax and enjoy the movie ."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),This movie has an identity crisis..,"The first part of the movie , well more like 2/3's was trying to be a suspense/ action movie w a bit of sci-fi, and drama...then it turned into a comedy/horror failed attempt at camp flick. Essentially this film is a ""what not to do when making a film in any genre 101"" . I gave it a 2 or 3 stars because I actually don't even think there's anything the actors could do to save the script so the acting isn't even the worse part. What I expected and what it was...
I didn't expect this to be scary but at least have some jump scares and a bit of excitement and some cohesive story however I found myself fast forwarding through most of the first half's dialogue because it was that boring. The action scenes are pretty bad with overdone Cgi making it hard to even follow what is happening in the scene. I actually kept forgetting some scenes were supposed to be under water as it didn't resemble water at all, it looked more like bad space scenes. Another issue was the way the actors were so unaffected by things, like when their friends and family are possibly dead the rest of the crew acts so matter of fact that it leaves the viewer not caring either. It's a good movie to keep on while doing house work since there's only a couple ok scenes and the storyline is pretty dumb."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),Meg 2: The Trench is campy ... But not in a fun way.,"I am certain that this film was made for the sole reason of giving the actors and crew a reason to go on location in Phuket, Thailand. I expected the film to be a bit of fun or maybe have some funny moments, but nope ... that didn't happen. My viewing standards have changed over the years so maybe I simply cannot get into these sort of movies any longer. And here's a very strange observation: Anyone in the cast who had a villainous role was a poster-child for bad cosmetic surgery and/or 'roid use. The only character I liked was DJ (Page Kennedy) who is reprising his role from 2018's ""The Meg"". I liked him because he seemed like the only half-way believable and sane actor in the entire film. And the monsters were cartoonish."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),The first movie was plausible.,"Just got through watching the Meg 2. I thought the first one was a stretch, but maybe could happen. This one, while interesting was just so farfetched and ridiculous. That I was asking myself...how LONG is this movie. Is it over yet? That's a bad sign. I appreciate that most of the cast returned for the second movie, but the constant comedic quips and outlandish fighting scenes, like firing a .50 caliber firearm while leaping sideways to shoot a prehistoric creature is just one such instance. I know movies like to go bigger and better than the first movie, but really...it was a bit TOO much. I'm praying there isn't a Meg 3 in the works. Peace."
Meg 2: The Trench (2023),"I wasn't expecting much, but yikes.","The first one was really quite bad, but at least seemed self aware of its mindless creature feature nature. It still had the occasional jump scare and silly ""so bad, it's funny"" moments. This sequel has absolutely nothing going for it. I'm being generous with a 2/10. It was boring nonsense from beginning to end. Terrible performances across the board, worse than terrible writing with wall to wall cringe worthy dialogue... I get what they were going for trying to pack in other scary creatures but meh. Lame execution and didn't care enough about any single character to respond to what crazy thing was eating who. Maybe the stupid ""Chomp On This"" hip hop credits song would have been funny if any part of the movie had been remotely entertaining. Instead, it made it even worse because the confident tone of it only works if any part of the film had been successful and satisfying. Do not waste your time."
The Menu (2022),A good old-fashioned satire,"This film has fallen victim of mis-listing: someone somewhere put the tags ""comedy"" and ""thriller"" beside the title, that is. It is neither though. It is a dark satire: a vitriolic portray of loathsome characters in an allegory. So, if you know what a satire is supposed to be like AND you like the genre, you'll probably like The Menu. If you don't know what a satire is, google it before watching. If you don't like what you'd find, don't waste your time on the film, as you wouldn't like it either. If you don't feel like googling, here are some clues: it's NOT funny, there's NO character development and NO catharsis. If In fact you'll probably feel annoyed, tense and a bit sick to your stomach by the end, as it DOES show mirror to the middle class wannabe connoiseurs of all kinds. So if you still watch it and you don't like that you see... well.... You've been warned."
The Menu (2022),Kitchen Nightmares,"Ive worked at the restaurant industry for seven years. Customers can truely make or break your day. This movie explores the dynamic between server and customer, with over the top drama and horror. It is such a unique movie, because they really make you feel the built up frustration of the servers and cooks. There is great attention to detail in the movie. The dishes look fly af, which I think is a great addition. In the beginning, you feel like youre experiencing the dishes with the customers. This makes the movie that much more intruiging. After Jeremies 'the mess', things take a turn. It becomes more of a 'saw' type of thing. Of course, the movie had to take this turn. However, I felt like the turn could have been more subtle. The servers are all unanimously suicidal, insane and sadistic. I understand that this could be some sort of analogy for the thoughts I used to have when having a bad day at work. Still, the movie turns bizarre at this point. All in all, I liked it. Great acting, asthonishing dishes, thrilling story. A bit over the top, but that did not spoil my appetite fortunately."
The Menu (2022),Odd entertaining movie,"I knew there were some shocks in this movie and something with the food cooked in the movie. I was generally surprised by some of the twists and was entertained throughout. I guess the movie is a satire about the silliness of gourmet dining and how critiques and the business side of the restaurant business ruin the joy of cooking. The story is about a couple who get on a boat to a private island to eat at a restaurant by this renowned chef played by Ralph Fiennes. There are other people there including a couple who dines their regularly, business man, a movie star and his publicist on the decline, and a food critic. Throughout the movie there is a focus on the couple, where the man sseems enamored by the chef, while his date is a last minute addition to the evening. The movie goes through each course of the dinner and there is a story behind each meal. These get increasingly odd and shocking such as laser printing images on tortillas that are of relevance to the person and may make them look bad, and a chef killing himself. Once this occurs the movie becomes more of a thriller as the guests start to figure out they are in danger. The way the movie ends is odd but interesting and I got what it meant."
The Menu (2022),"Nice food, but 2 toxic 4 me","I enjoyed the first half, the food tasting and watching the show. But as a whole the movie leaves a bad taste, a thick toxic anti-rich people sentiment and other political messaging, with an unlikeable female lead (naturally, everyone was unlikeable but felt incorrect that she was too). A pity, it was so close to being good. Zooming out, there is probably some high IQ satirizing I just don't get. As it could probably be deconstructed into various deeper takes on society; paradoxical as a similar deconstruction (this intellectual circle jerking and food critique) was the very thing that was depicted satirically in the movie to begin with. How quaint... - see I can sound like a movie critic too, but Chef knows I really belong in the kitchen. Anyway, why do they push so hard that society only consists of two kinds of people: takers and producers (proletariat)? A peculiar dichotomy, too toxic for me, but maybe I just don't understand."
The Menu (2022),A surreal film!,"A surreal film that evoked numerous emotions within me,
High visual quality and great storytelling,
A fantastic, profound story full of surprises,
An exceptional work that is rarely matched! The output quality was professional, and the story plot was thrilling. I liked the unexpected and coherent sequence of events! I admired the portrayal of the social pressure and occupational burnout caused by capitalism on the chef! It was unexpected that there was no dialogue at the end. The girl's reaction after being rescued was not announced; it only stopped when the restaurant exploded! The movie has an underlying message, which is ""you should listen to others to understand them and know how to interact with them, and you should find someone who listens to you."" When the girl heard the chef and spoke to him, confronting him, it was a great gesture that saved her life."
The Menu (2022),Sooooo disappointing - sooooo overrated,"What a waste of time. Really. Started nice. Good Atmosphere. But then it went downhill the whole time. You are waiting for a twist, for it to make sense, for anything to happen really. But it doesnt. The guests dont do nothing while people get killed, while knowing they are gonna be killed. Yeah, Sure. 🤦 No character close to a human in this storyline. All characters are flat as F and not relatable. They act like they are aliens. And you dont care for them, since they dont do anything. Who wrote that? WTH It's like a dude on the street had one tiny idea about a point he wanted to make and then he accidentally won the lottery to produce a movie, while all authors and screenplay writers were on strike. So he just did it in his own. In one night. Reviewers here call it great satire on rich people here, cause it's ""different"" and depicts rich peoples obsession over art. Or that people consume Till the end even when they know this will kill them. All that stuff. Bluh bluh. It just doesnt work. The irony: these reviewers might be exactly these ""art obsessed"" people they are talking about. Interpreting the ""overall picture"" and stuff in it to make themselves important by ""understanding"" the movie, while others (like me) are just bored as hell. The movie is consistent in it's stupidity. What a waste of Ralph Fiennes btw. (and pretty much any actor in this movie; but hey, they got paid)"
The Menu (2022),Yooo wt....,"If they didn't tell white people this was a comedy they would never know.... Or is this funny to them? As I sit in between my blackness and my girlfriend (which has direct recent European ancestry) I ponder the entire world in the 43mins I could take before I started to feel like my brain cells were being destroyed, what's wrong with them? Are they the devil? Are they so deeply vile that in any scenario this waste of time of a film could be considered a comedy? Are they human? Am I human? Are they individual idiots but genus smar..... Do they understand they are the scourge of the planet that is causing everything that they from ""climate change"" to killing precious animals plants and other natural life with deforestation and the continuous but unnecessary drilling fracking drills and pumping of this earth. Then it hits me if I was a demon spawn an evil person then I would think this a comedy."
The Menu (2022),A film about the revenge of the common man,"The film The Menu is about a chef, Chef Slowik- played by Ralph Fiennes, who invites a group of upper-class foodies to a conceptually themed dinner. Each of the guests invited or allowed, he believed enacted some sort of transgression related to entitlement and corruption of power. The film takes place at Hawthorne, on a secluded island that you must travel to by ferry. The main characters included Margot- played by Anya Taylor-Joy, Tyler- played by Nicholas Hoult, Elsa- played by Hong Chau, among several others. The menu is comprised of different lessons or courses, pertaining to his customers. Throughout the courses of the dining experience, you find out what each customer was guilty of. With each course, the Chef gives an overview of what inspired the dishes. Within each overview is a back-handed compliment to the food and the diners. The unexpecting guests have no idea what type of dining experience they are in for until the third course. This course, named ""Memory"" was preceded by an introduction in which his sous chef, Jeremy-played by Adam Aalderks, unexpectedly put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. At this point, the guests of the restaurant knew they were in for something they did not sign up for. The obvious theme of this film is about classism, and how the elites can never be satisfied no matter how exquisite the product is. Chef Slowik has come to believe that the more money people have, the more ungrateful they are for the little things in life and his goal for his final masterpiece was to show his guests and the world what we have come to. His satirical titles and ideas behind his dishes in the film describe just how far his guests are from the ""common man"". The Menu is said to be similar to the film The Feast because they both have a viewpoint of punishing the elites. The film uses lighting and color to emphasize the theme. In every scene, we see vibrant colors, from the colors of the plants when they are walking on the tour, to the colors in the dishes. Everything is energetic and astonishing, as is the entire film. The film also incorporates a smooth-grain film stock which goes perfectly with the theme of classism. It displays the top of the line clarity and contrasts, only for the best, just as for the guests at Hawthorne."
The Menu (2022),An absolute masterpiece,"I went to cinema with my sister 6 months ago just to spend friday evening. What an absolute masterpiece, i enjoyed every minute of it. I decided yesterday to watch it again. Still, an absolute masterpiece. But i have slightly different view on this. First of all, yes, it's reflects of how meaningless an absolute perfection is. An absolute pinnacle of restaurant cuisine to these snobs is like throwing pearls to pig, they just dont appreciate it. For rich couple it's just another dinner to discuss daily problems, for critics just another evening to get inspiration for next article. For finance-bros just another expensive dinner to get drunk that they can easily afford,. For that failed actor just another expensive place to bring his date. But i think Tyler is the only one who truly did enjoy it. I'm sure getting a seat there was one of the highlights of it, dude probably didnt sleep for a week looking forward to it. Same pattern could be seen on every aspect of life. Cars for example. Rich folk drive Lamborghinis-Ferraris-Maseratis. I overheard some rich kid rolling to highschool in brand new Hellcat, he didnt even know which engine is in it - just asked daddy to get him the highest trim level. But Tyler on the otherhand, probably works on a low level job and could never have such lifestyle. So after saving up a bunch of money he could finally afford a trip to Dubai, to rent a Ferrari for 24h. And you can be sure that he drove 24h straight and could remember every second of it for the rest of his life. I'm sure that rich couple have whole basement full of expensive wines, 10 high-end cars in their mansion's garage, have seen everything and every place they have desired - but still feel empty inside as they have reached absolute tip of the life and cant climb any higher."
The Menu (2022),A story of needing a little appreciation,"*Includes spoilers* The plot of this film is people going to an exclusive restaurant, that is owned by a chef who has lost his love for cooking, and no one appreciates his food. Ralph Fiennes, who plays Chef, once had a large love for cooking. Slowly, his love for cooking grew smaller and all he tried to do was please people. Anya Taylor-Joy, who portrays Margot, was not originally supposed to be at the restaurant. She is able to save herself when she becomes honest with the Chef about his food. She is the only one who can truly appreciate his food, as she is also in the service industry. Tyler, portrayed by Nicholas Holt, appreciates the Chef, but in an obsessive ""I want to be you"" way. Part of the theme is ""appreciation"". Chef just wants people to recognize his talent and art. When he realizes that does not happen, he decides to take others down with him. Throughout the film, while Chef feels no appreciation, he is still searching for it. Margot, being in a service industry also, understands the need for appreciation. Lighting plays a part in this theme. In the beginning, the lighting is bright, which shows everyone is excited to go to the restaurant, the camera angles and lighting of the island show the appreciation of the agriculture. It shows how lively the island is with the crops and the animals. In the restaurant, the lighting is not as vibrant, except for in the kitchen. This helps to show that the customers do not truly appreciate Chef, although the staff members in the kitchen do. The camera angle towards the end also shows appreciation. When Margot asks for a cheeseburger, it invokes a happy memory for Chef, a time when he appreciated cooking. When Margot enjoys the cheeseburger, the camera angle is a close-up of Chef, showing his expression of feeling genuinely appreciated. Overall, this film shows how lack of appreciation can cause a person to feel lost and without purpose. The slightest bit of appreciation can make a person feel gratitude and feel like they have a purpose again."
Pearl (2022),"""No, I'm a star! Please, I'm a star! Please, somebody help me!""","FILM: 7.5/10. Stuck in a mandatory two-week quarantine, Ti West did what any filmmaker would do - he wrote a prequel to a film he hadn't even shot. Collaborating with lead Mia Goth, they churned out a script for Pearl, the prequel to X, and A24 greenlit it for shooting before a single frame of X was seen. Turns out, it was a smart decision. Pearl not only stands as an excellent film in its own right but also surpasses its predecessor. Ti West and his team maintain consistency with X, yet Pearl takes a wholly different approach. While X had a grungy, grainy look capturing the essence of 1979, Pearl embraces a clean, vibrant, and pure aesthetic - a perfect reflection of how the character Pearl sees herself in the world. Unlike X's ensemble approach, Pearl places the load on Mia Goth's shoulders, and she delivers a fantastic performance. As a psychotic imitation of Judy Garland's Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, Goth brings a unique and captivating energy to her character. David Corenswet, known for being the newly cast Superman, impresses as the Projectionist, giving me an opportunity to witness his talent beyond a single House of Cards episode. Much like X, Pearl takes its time with the horror elements, and when the terror unfolds, it's as gloriously entertaining as its predecessor. What sets it apart, however, is its effectiveness in contrasting with the vibrant experience earlier in the film. Ti West's Pearl is a smart and visually striking prequel that successfully navigates the horror genre with finesse, proving that even in quarantine, creative risks can pay off. Ultimately, it stands as a superior counterpart to X.

Pearl (2022),Pretentious and Boring,"It's a formulaic pretentious, boring movie. It has all the elements of a horror cult, but without any substance to it. Mia Goth is phenomenal, but it's such a waste to see a performance like that in a very dull movie. People seem to be impressed very easily these days considering I can only assume all the hype comes from Goth's acting, that monologue and the final smile that closes the film, but at least in my opinion those are not enough to make this movie any good and, especially, consistent. I think the first movie was ok and I'm still curious to see what Goth will pull off next time, but I don't want to see that pathetic smile ever again in my life."
Pearl (2022),"Good acting showcase, rubbish film","I can only assume this is getting good reviews because people adore Mia Goth and can't get enough of her playing crazy people, because, as a film, this just does not work. It's not scary, lacks tension, is badly structured and poorly paced, and is in DIRE need of an editor. It feels both too long and too short, like it ends at the end of the second act. It's barely even a film - just a bunch of acting and a thin, half-arsed script, with some pretentious and undeveloped Wizard Of Oz stylings thrown in. Scenes drag on forever, way past the point of terminal boredom, just so that Goth can show off her acting. I've never felt so much impatience and fidgeting in a cinema. The ending is supposed to be disturbing, but it just ends up being comical. To put this into perspective, I thought 'X' was ok, slightly above -average but nothing special. I thought House Of The Devil was a minor classic, and I thought The Sacrament was quite effective and tense. Mia Goth is a good actor, but she always seems to play the same part. 'Pearl' just feels like an actor's indulgence."
Pearl (2022),A film devoid of everything,"Incredible to see people rating this pretentious fare so highly, but I guess that's modern tastes for you and I'm somehow out of sync with everybody else. This one's a prequel to the dire X and turns out to be even worse, a ridiculous 'origin' story that's so slim it doesn't require telling in the first place. Mia Goth is the star turn here and delivers a twee, over the top performance, her acting so mannered and false from the outset that I could barely bring myself to watch her. There are a few predictable deaths but they're overshadowed by the director's decision to shoot this like an old fashioned Technicolor epic for no good reason. The end result? A film utterly devoid of substance."
Pearl (2022),"It's good. But ignore the 9 star reviews, it's not even in the top 5 Mia Goth films!","Look, it's fine. Arguably, better than fine - it's good. But that's it! Yes Mia Goth is terrific, as she always is, but the delirious level of praise I'm seeing in numerous reviews giving it 8 or 9 stars is frankly mind boggling, and was what spurred me to write this ""everyone just calm down"" of a review. To those reviewers that raved about this movie and bestowed the superlative 9 stars, I have but a simple question: have you not watched any other films before? I'm trying really hard not to be condescending (ok, not that hard), but if this flic merits 9 stars, then what on earth do any of the following films merit? Alien, The Shining, Interstellar, The Departed, The Prestige, Inception... to name but a few. Like I said, it's good. But it's not even in the top 5 Mia Goth films: The Survivalist, Suspiria, Emma, Infinity Pool, A cure for wellness. Go watch those before this!"
Pearl (2022),"""Pearl"" explores the limits of a character full of traumas, dreams and frustrations who, despite everything, apparently, will never stop believing that she is a star","The year is 1918. Young Pearl (Mia Goth) has returned to live on her parents' farm after her husband Howard (Alistair Sewell) was drafted into the Great War. Pearl dreams of being a great dancer, famous throughout the country, so her frustration in returning to live at her parents' house, where she needs to take care of her sick father and is constantly humiliated by her mother, is enormous. When she discovers that a selection process for new artists in a dance company will be held in her city, Pearl sees the opportunity for the life she always wanted. But the consequences of her decision will go far beyond what she could imagine. Created by Ti West and Mia Goth, and produced simultaneously with ""X"", ""Pearl"" is the sequel that many fans of the previous film didn't know they needed. Overexplaining is often condemned in horror cinema, and the story of the elderly murderer in ""X"" really required no further explanation. But West and Goth treat the character's transformation process with so much care and affection that the minimal references covered (such as the justification of the character's anger towards blondes, or the iconic gesture of silence) work almost like fan service. Just like its eponymous protagonist, ""Pearl"" is a film with many layers. It can be seen as just an origin story, but it is much more than that. It is also an essay on mental health, taking into account the psychotic tendencies demonstrated by the character from the beginning, exacerbated by the cornering imposed by her own reality. Explaining who the damn villain was who turned our stomachs with such graphic deaths, the prequel to ""X"" is not that classic jump scare horror, but it is definitely an impeccable essay on a psychotic break. Pearl's (Mia Goth) reality could drive anyone crazy. With her husband at war, she dedicates her days back to her parents' house, where she must take care of her father - who remains in a vegetative state -, while being constantly humiliated and mistreated by her mother. Between the chores on the farm and the palliative care that takes away her energy, she dreams of the life of a star on stage and in cinema. Always between the purest and most mind-blowing fantasy and a harsh reality never desired, she tries to chart her path towards success, fame and plastic beauty. What they didn't tell you is that in an arid land, dreams born from the field don't tend to flourish. And under a very technicolor aesthetic, which harks back to the format of films from the 50s and 60s, Ti West delivers another brilliant horror that goes much further than the combo of scares that normally awaits us in a slasher horror. ""Pearl"" is in fact a chaotic spiral of a young woman adrift of her own existence, who perishes in a mediocre life where her identity and personality are stifled and succumbed to the pressures of an aggressive, insensitive and indifferent matriarch. But regardless of the family context that brought Pearl to us, it is undeniable that villainy already lived within her, as West makes a point of showing in her tortuous way of sacrificing defenseless animals. And this construction is fundamental to turning the elderly Pearl from ""X"" into a cruel and monstrous creature in the eyes of the characters and, obviously, the audience. The story takes place in the 60s, at the beginning of the 20th century. In the typical horror setting of rural, isolated and silent America, we meet Pearl (Mia Goth), a seemingly ordinary young woman in pre-Depression America. Pearl is tormented by the anguish of her husband's return from war. This anguish gives part of the tone of the film. Anxiety gives Pearl a feeling of stagnation, of being there and stuck with her family. Pearl needs to take care of her father, who needs special care. She needs to be surrounded by her mother, who judges her and weighs her relationship with the world - a classic for complex female characters. But the family does not appear to be extremely dysfunctional like in other films of the genre. With a surgical simplicity, the photography and scenography perfectly mask what lies behind this bucolic setting. Like a bad apple: rotten on the inside, but very beautiful on the outside. Here we have the interesting issue of mixing times and themes. A narrative with deep discussions about the feminine, family conflicts and psychoses, issues that derive from the culmination of crises between the different areas of a human being's mind, so explored in horror cinema from the seventies - there we have infinite iconic examples of characters who they stained the youthful imagination of the time with blood - but in a setting from the beginning of the 20th century. The focus on emotions and family relationships, a vulnerable and uncertain main character, who develops into a very subversive and adverse heroine's trajectory, and a lot of symbolic depth, transform ""Pearl"" into a beautiful way of making bloody cinema. The film features ""gore"" scenes from the beginning, but it is in the second half that things start to get even stranger. Ti West manages to make us nervous by bringing horror scenes that take place in the dark or in broad daylight, causing that nail-biting anxiety just because we are sure that what is coming is not at all good. The characterization with more colorful tones and farm settings that bring peace, and even remind us of ""The Sound of Music"", contrast perfectly with the slasher every time blood is spilled. But terror is also in every word and attitude of the protagonist, who surprises in several moments, such as a frightening and uncut monologue seen in the final moments of the film. Pearl ends up discovering that the film industry also relies on pornography, and this discovery is crucial to the plot's relationship with ""X"", which takes place more than 60 years after ""Pearl"". Connecting both films in a natural and almost imperceptible way, this is a derivative that stands on its own two feet and in several moments is nothing like ""X"". With a slightly metalinguistic approach and a different narrative development, the film focuses on the self-destructive journey of a young woman who goes crazy in the face of her reality and the impossibility of her dreams. The plot of ""Pearl"" is simple, only on the surface. And this is because the complexity of the narrative does not revolve around the story itself (although it contributes, of course, to the final result), but rather, its protagonist. In this sense, Ti West's film is a beautiful character study, a lesson in how to explore the different facets of a figure and what led her to become what she became. In fact, it would be unfair to praise only Ti West for the successes of ""Pearl"", given that Mia Goth is also one of the work's screenwriters and producers. The actress not only helped create an entire narrative conducive to the protagonist's transformation into a terrible villain, but also delivered an award-worthy performance (no wonder, many complained about her absence in the Best Actress category at the 2023 Oscars). It is impressive how the artist manages to reinvent herself throughout the narrative, going from a naive and hopeful girl to a disillusioned and broken woman, who rebuilds herself through a cold, villainous figure, who has no problem murdering her own parents, her love interest, husband and sister-in-law in favor of what she wants most: fame (or would it be freedom through fame?). Talking about how the actress alternates between periods of remission and psychotic episodes in a matter of seconds, or the show of expressions in her smile in the final scene, is redundant. But what she delivers in an 8-minute-long monologue in the last act of the film is astounding. The young woman's speech, filmed without cuts (seriously, the passage is exquisite), summarizes everything that Pearl carried within her: frustration, depression, sadness, anger, love, dreams and so on. All cards are laid out on the table with an emotion and intensity that are not so common to see, especially in horror films, which tend to focus much more on their scary plots than on the development of their characters. And we still couldn't fail to mention the next scene, with the ax sequence, which is simply harrowing. Filling its second act with a bloodthirsty that will fill the eyes of those most hungry for slashers, ""Pearl"" still makes room for a touch of humor and plays with the emotional fluctuations of its protagonist, transforming it into a small mix between horror and a sarcasm with an acidic and cutting humor. Violent but not at all scary, Ti West's newest film is something of a villain's journey. While making a number of connections, the film doesn't add anything genuinely new to ""The Mark of Death,"" it's a wonderful companion piece, the kind of conceptual horror that's so meticulously well-made, it deserves to be enjoyed even as a one-off experience. A young woman face to face with the worst version of herself. The film also brings an interesting critique about fame: is anything worth it to reach the top? For Pearl, limits are non-existent and there is nothing more important than the glamor of the stage. In this sense, her blood-red clothing, used during the last act of the film, in addition to representing the deaths she carries with her, is a symbol of her passion and obsession (red usually has this connotation in cinematographic works). With a masterful performance by Mia Goth, ""Pearl"" is a pleasant surprise and hits the nail on the head when exploring the limits of a character full of traumas, dreams and frustrations who, despite everything, apparently, will never stop believing that she is a star."
Pearl (2022),My favorite film of 2022. Goth is a tour de force! (minor spoilers),"This is my favorite movie of 2022 hands down. I'd dare call it perfect even. Pearl is unlike any other serial killer origin film I've seen. Without doubt due to Mia Goth, who, with this and her (terrifying) role in Brandon Cronenberg's ""Infinity Pool"" solidifies her indie/cult queen status. I will watch anything with her in it from now on. The film is actually a prequel to director Ti West's underwhelming slasher ""X"" (also starring Goth though criminally under utilized) but can be viewed as a stand alone film as it's entirely different in tone, visuals, pacing etc.. in other words (other than the alligator and the husband becoming what he is in X) there's essentially no connection. Most serial killer films are about men and concentrate on anger or abnormal psychology-bizarre motives etc. It tends to get boring. Pearl doesn't have motives except to get off the farm she lives in. She isn't a psychopath or evil. She's abandoned and lives in a state of trauma. To cope with this she has fantasies of being a star. Of a perfect world for her and her husband. She thinks her dreams are coming true when she meets a projectionist who promises to show her the world. It's only when the dream of escape is shattered that she snaps into murderous rage. The pinnacle of the film (and some of the finest acting you will ever see) is a 7 minute shot of Pearl unloading EVERYTHING she feels inside to the horror of the person listening. I shall say no more. A truly iconic scene. It is sort of similar to ""May"" with its themes of loneliness/isolation which is a stellar film I recommend. Lastly: Ti West I've always wanted to love Ti West's films but generally find them disappointing (I did enjoy House of the Devil and The Sacrament) however this film is in a league of its own. And while Mia Goth IS the film (and also co writer) West still made it possible and does so via beautiful cinematography (It's a very colorful film) and PERFECT pacing (my biggest complaint from his previous films) The body count is low but graphic, but it isn't a slasher film. It's a coming of age character study of a girl so traumatized she turns to murder as a catharsis for her ever mounting woes."
Pearl (2022),Aside Lady Goth. Horror's new gold standard setter.,"I've now seen all three of Mia Goth's extraordinary A24 movies this year. In each one she has singlehandedly carried the movie to ridiculous heights of greatness. All three are billed as horror (X as a slasher, Infinity Pool as an unhinged psychopath study and Pearl as another psychopath gestational study). All three deepen A24's reputation as the distributor of the year/decade, the greatest signifier of quality in moviemaking right now. All three mark out Goth as the leading horror female actor in history if not, increasingly, one of the great female actors of her generation full stop. It's Pearl that that confirms this most potently as her performance is jaw dropping throughout. It's the origin piece for X, but the two movies could hardly be less similar, even though the central character is the same person (60 years apart) and shot on the same farm location in Kansas. This tells the tale of young married Pearl with her husband labouring in the European trenches of WWII, her father a wheelchair stricken quadriplegic - a victim of the Spanish Flu which is a clever reference as it was written by Goth and Director Ti West during lockdown - and her raging mother, a German immigrant trapped by her crippled husband in rural America and resentful to the back teeth because of it. Goth (Pearl) wants to escape this and become a dancer but is thwarted at auditions for not being blonde enough. This triggers her inner psychopath and whilst we don't get a rampage on the scale of X we do see her nascent evil emerge. It's Goth's startling performance and Ti West's dazzling direction that marks this out as a horror of sheer class, although in truth it's not really a horror at all: not a single jump scare and very little in the way of butchery. Two scenes stand out, both featuring Goth, a long monologue to her friend and the closing credits which are reminiscent of Sinead Connor's classic pop video. This is movie making at its finest and a must see in my opinion."
Pearl (2022),Huh?,"I simply do not understand people's infatuation with this movie. What do they see that I don't? A pointless, predictable, pretentious flim that drags on and on. It felt like a 2+ hour movie. Mia Goth is a good actress, I'm not denying that, but she needs better material. This is a prequel to X, which was okay at best, that sheds very little light on what happens in X. Just a lot of goofing around and mugging for the camera. Apparently Ti West and Mia Goth wrote this while in quarantine to shoot X in during the pandemic. It makes sense because it felt like something that was wrote in a few days and just thrown together. Most of the ""character developments"" here were implied in X and really didn't need to be shown. What a waste of time."
Pearl (2022),Odd recommendation...,"So, I got this off an article about Martin Scorsese, telling me ""80 Films the Director Wants You to See."" (First off, Marty's got some unusual selections in there, including a fair amount of horror). ""Pearl"" is definitely unique and visually appealing, and this story of a Midwest farmgirl maniacally obsessing over fame, stardom, and a new life, seems to have developed a cult following on the edge of town outside the mainstream. I generally don't do slasher films, but I'm not above a little blood-soaked fun in my thriller-mysteries. Pearl is an angelic-faced dreamer who... well, let's say you don't want to disappoint her... or face her wrath. I thought the story was a little odd and thin, but it was like a train wreck you can't look away from. If you like your unexpected carnage plated sweetly, like apple pie or corn on the cob, this wholesome girl might be just the server for you. I was a 6.5 but I rounded up because hey, Martin Scorsese. Duh."
Black Christmas (1974),Infuriating But Entertaining Thriller...,"I'm ashamed to admit that I've never seen the movie ""Black Christmas"" until the other day. Especially since I grew up in that era, a HUGE fan of horror/slasher films, and also a fan of director Bob Clark (I even liked the movie ""Rhinestone""). ;)
I was really impressed with it, seeing its inspiration on ""Halloween"", ""When a Stranger Calls"", and even Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (the police procedural scenes, and even having John Saxon in a similar role ;) ), and some awesome camera work and film techniques, and awesome moments of pure visual storytelling on a top tier level. But I was very let down with the ending because it not only revealed a lot of idiot plot but was very infuriating that it set up a brilliant air of mystery just to never solve it and leave the main reveal out of the story, smh. Trust me, I LOVE ambiguous endings, matter of fact that's kind of my favorite way to end something (I tend to even do it a lot in my own writing), but I consider it almost criminal as a storyteller to set up a great mystery and never reveal the outcome and leave it completely unresolved. Matter of fact, the identity of the killer (and motive and backstory if felt necessary) could have been revealed and it would have made the ending even better instead of feeling anticlimactic. I would still recommend any fan of horror, suspense and/or slasher films check it out, it's definitely worth at least one viewing. It is very entertaining, and boasts a terrific cast, including Olivia Hussey, Kier Dulea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon, and an outstanding performance from Andrea Martin from SCTV fame. ~ Randall Brooks

Black Christmas (1974),"A GREAT movie, period","Light spoilers ahead:. So I just watched this for the first time in my life and although I am not a huge fan of slashers I have to say... this was just a great MOVIE, period. First of all I would not call it a slasher per se (more like a mystery-horror-who done it) secondly it was smart, beautifully lit, shot and acted. It had little to no blood, but because we got to know these characters it was actually thrilling! The phone calls by Billy were DERANGED (I was actually surprised they got away with that kind of language, and I can't remember seeing a Horror made in the last decade that had similar dialogue/monologue...have we gotten soft?)
I even think the whole POV stuff was pretty groundbreaking. Remember cameras were HUGE back then and they still managed to have a guy climb up a ladder with it on his shoulder (?), Kathrin Bigalow had to invent a whole rig system for similar scenes in Strange Days! And that was 30 years later. All my issues with this film are in the third act! It's simply not believable that she wouldn't run to the policeman outside for help as soon as she learned the killer was inside the house (she didn't know he was dead in his car). Speaking of which, who killed that cop? Also, why would everyone leave the scene of the crime in the last scene and even turn the lights off and let her sleep, that doesn't make any sense, even for the 70ies. Plus, if the police actually checked all the rooms (including the attic) as soon as there was the missing persons report for the first victim, none of the other murders would have happened. These minor things aside, Black Christmas totally surprised me and I am adding it to my collection. 9/10 stars!"
Black Christmas (1974),"Don't Scream, it's Christmas!","As one of the first forays into the slasher subgenre, ""Black Christmas"" (1974) stands out by developing and influencing several elements that would become recurrent in horror cinema, solidifying its position as a macabre Christmas classic that has transcended generations. The film's plot skillfully mixes excessive and unpretentious humor with a disturbing theme, creating a unique atmosphere that combines the festive atmosphere of Christmas with moments of intense tension. The plot, centered on the killer's vulgar connections and dual personality, is constructed in an engaging way. Even without completely revealing the antagonist's appearance, the cold atmosphere of the scenes involving this bizarre character is remarkable. The script, although not overly complex, develops subplots and characters effectively, bringing life to the secondary actors. The death scenes, surprisingly, have aged well and continue to deliver impactful results, something unusual for films from the 70s. ""Black Christmas"" is notable for its ingenuity in transforming a seemingly simple plot into a great Christmas-themed horror production, solidifying itself as one of the greatest classics within this specific proposal."
Black Christmas (1974),not another christmas movie,"Christmas and horror, a terrible mixture? Less than one might think, the film works as a special gem in both moods, although I wouldn't include it in my / a Christmas film collection, because the festival of festivals only appears from time to time in passing. And beware, those who are approaching maturity should definitely be excluded from watching this film: harsh language, the fundamentally disturbing mixture of premises mentioned above and, of course, the fact that we have a real slasher precursor here, despite the early year of its production. After Psycho, the Giallos and before the classic slasher wave comes somewhat lonely Black Christmas. And here various optional basics are already being practised, the killer-me perspective, yes, before Halloween, that there doesn't necessarily need to be an obvious motive for murder and that young ladies are a favourite target of the madmen. But of course we are still in the middle of the 70s. The production focuses more on suspense than on explicit bloodlust, and the killings are packaged indirectly through special camera and sound sequences. So beware again, gorehounds could definitely be disappointed here, just like those who need high tempo and constant thrills. Nevertheless, the fantastic finale should please every genre fan."
Black Christmas (1974),1974 classic horror,"It appears many are having a difficult time conducting a review of a 1974 film through a 2023 lens, I was in grade eight when this movie came out and I can remember two classmates sneaking into the theatre to watch this movie and they quickly became folk hero's for their effort. Movies like Black Christmas and The Texas Chainsaw were gritty ground breaking terror in their day and the original films still hold up today - so when reviewing them take that in to consideration and appreciate them for what they are, disturbing poorly lit sets and poor sound quality are all part of the classic charm."
Black Christmas (1974),It's Me Billy!,"For me this is the film that is the first true slasher. It has all the tropes: a holiday, pov of the killer, a killer whose face we never see, sex, a final girl and butchering innocents for no expressed reason. Black Christmas is a very effective film and is a telling of the old legend of an ominous prank caller in one's own house. Bob Clark directed this and he got it right. The plot should be well known by now. I won't spend much time on it, but I love how this film ends with the police taking Jess to an upstairs bedroom to recuperate from her boyfriend who she believes is the killer. He's not and the poor bastard is killed because of this misunderstanding. Jess is resting on a bed. Mr Harrison, father of one of the sorority house girls, has fainted and is taken to a hospital. The camera never breaks frame. We see Jess lying in bed. Off camera we hear the commotion of the police and other officials milling about their business. Eventually an officer turns off the bedroom light in the room where Jess is resting. Camera never breaks frame. Then the house is silent. Evidently the officers have vacated the house thinking all is settled and well. The camera now pans right to a vacant bedroom where Barb was murdered. We see a sheetless mattress with bloodstains, still the camera pans right. Another bedroom; here we see a suitcase packed at the foot of a made bed. Camera pans right to the end of the hall. We see a wall ladder leading to the attic. Camera settles here. Suddenly we see a faint shifting of movement in the attic and a light. Now we are in the attic. We see Clare dead with a plastic bag over her face in a rocking chair. We see Mrs Mac, the house mother, dead swinging on a grab hook; we hear a voice 'it's me Billy'. Camera pans outside away from house. A serene scene. Night sky, Christmas lights, a lone police officer milling about outside the house, suddenly we hear a phone ring and ring. Credits roll. Very effective and creepy ending. The antagonist is never caught. The case isn't settled, but the actors think it is. Bravo, well done, that's how tension and horror are produced in a film."
Black Christmas (1974),Black Christmas will ROCK you too,"Let me preface this post by pointing out that the reason there are so many bad reviews for this movie is because a bunch of dingus's didn't bother to check that they were reviewing the right movie. Black Christmas was released in 1974. Which I'll be reviewing. It was then remade in 2006, and remade again in 2019. And from what I've heard about the most recent remake, it deserves the harsh criticism. Now as for the original: I absolutely loved it. I saddens me that horror films like this aren't produced as much anymore. It's far easier to just throw together a cheesy, terrible plot, and accent it with cheap jump scares, cringe-worthy dialogue, and visual effects nowadays. Looking back at the films that made the genre what it is today has helped me realize, at least, how much the horror genre as a whole has devolved over the years, and helps me truly appreciate the gems that come out every now and then that defy genre norms today. Although the movie is labeled a horror/slasher film, I think it effectively utilizes terror throughout, as opposed to horror. For most those words probably mean the same thing, but without spoiling anything that happens in the film, let me explain the difference between horror and terror. Horror and terror are both types of fear: horror manifests itself in known threats more often than not, whereas terror manifests in unknown/unseen threats. It's an oversimplified distinction technically, but make of that what you will before watching the movie and you will see what difference the approach to fear makes in a ""horror"" film. Other than the execution, the cinematography was good, the acting was good...for the most part. There were some characters that I thought could have done better, but there were no awful actors. The pacing was quite good, although I feel they could have shortened the introduction a little. Overall it was just a great film."
Black Christmas (1974),Black Christmas,"I suppose a sorority can be used to host a multitude of characters, so that's what Bob Clark does here as he puts four quite different girls into an house supervised by the likably dypso ""Mrs. Mac"" (Marian Waldman). The house has, for ages now, being getting crank calls from a guy they call the ""moaner"". Some get upset by his behaviour, others laugh it off but when one of their number ""Clare"" (Lynne Griffin) disappears and the police are called in by her boyfriend ""Chris"" (Art Hindle), the sense of menace ratchets up a notch. As we get to know these characters, there are quite a few suspects and quite a few decent reasons why we might want to bump them all off. ""Jess"" (Olivia Hussey) is expecting a child with wayward boyfriend ""Pete"" (Keir Dullea) only he doesn't know it yet; give-as-good-as-you-get ""Barb"" (Margot Kidder) quite likes to goad their would-be tormentor (""Billy"") - much to his obvious chagrin. More menacing yet is the increasingly detailed knowledge contained in the calls. ""Billy"" is spookily well informed. Could he be one of them? I'm not too sure what this has to have to do with Christmas, to be honest. It's just another typical slasher set amongst a student fraternity that gives everyone an opportunity to scream and make some shockingly poor under-pressure decisions. Neither the acting nor the writing stand out but the photography is quite effective at creating and sustaining a modest sense of peril as our killer nears goal. It's not really very scary, indeed time hasn't been to kind to it at all - but it's watchable if you like the genre and have taken a drink or two."
Black Christmas (1974),Probably better in its day,"For someone who's watched as many 'slasher' films in my time (and enjoyed many a 'gore-fest' along the way!) it's taken me until 2023 to watch 'Black Christmas,' which. If the internet trivia is to be believed, is up there with horror classics like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Halloween' - in bringing the 'slasher' genre to the mainstream. It's about a killer, stalking residents of a sorority house one Christmas and, er, that's about it. It's pretty simple in terms of story, but then most slasher films tend to be that way. I hear that much the major gore was cut in order to get it released - and it shows. I would imagine that almost everything contained within this film would be considered 'shocking' and 'revolutionary' in terms of on-screen scares, whereas today, it's just kind of tame. As I say, there's not much gore. And there's not much that you haven't seen in a hundred similar movies. I suppose there's something to be got out of the story in trying to guess who the killer is (I confess, I never managed to see how it would eventually end). The characters are likable enough - those who are meant to be. And there are a few 'red herrings' thrown in there for good measure. The police were suitably useless in their efforts in catching the killer, but then if they were competent the film's runtime would be about ten minutes. 'Black Christmas' is worth a watch if you like competent slasher films - there's nothing here that's bad, but, after over forty years, there's nothing here that new either."
Black Christmas (1974),A Christmas horror story,"I have heard about this Christmas horror movie before, and I have been hearing people say that they love it or think it is an underrated horror movie; after watching the movie, I can agree that it is good and that it is a bit underrated. The movie Black Christmas (1974) is a creepy, disturbing, and mostly suspenseful horror movie that uses Christmas time in an investing way; plus, each girl in the sorority house has something happen to them, most of them having to deal with realistic problems, which makes it disturbing, not just because of a maniac killer being in the movie. The girls in the sorority are going through their own problems, like one of them wanting an abortion despite her boyfriend not wanting that, but there is also a maniac killer in the attic of the sorority house with nobody knowing; it makes the movie disturbing with the real problems the characters are going through, but also it makes it creepy with the way some characters act and the killer in the house. Along with that, the characters are like teenagers doing what teenagers do, but they do act like adults surprisingly; making rational choices like calling the police or trying not to answer the phone because of the many creepy and weird calls they get. I like that we never see the killer's face because he is covered by shadows or hides in darkness the whole movie, while also giving us his point of view where we only see his hands and his shoes when walking around; most of the cinematography have long takes and camera pans around the house that works with the creepy tone. Though the movie is rated R, which is for language and frightening scenes, it is not that gory, but it has disturbing kills in the movie that are still effective and are executed in ways that fit the Christmas holiday. Black Christmas (1974) is a Christmas horror film that is worth giving a watch, though it takes its time building up to a point where it gets creepier, it is a highly effective movie that will creep you out and disturb you from beginning to end. The acting is not bad, the cinematography is well done, the antagonist hiding in the house is creepy, and the Christmas vibe with the movie works well with the horror side of the plot; this movie is underrated and is worth watching at least once."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),My Personal Favourite...,"Adapted and based on the fourth Harry Potter book ""The Goblet of Fire"" is absolutely no disappointment! It's the fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry, Ron and Hermione returns as the iconic and unstoppable trio that every Harry Potter fan loves to watch every time. This time, Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry is getting a slight update this year. Because now, three schools are settled in together to fight each other in an epic tournament, with challenges to complete, and a great quest to finish and represent their school in honour and loyalty. This film doesn't just develop the main story greatly, but it makes small side stories to have something interesting too watch all the time. The conflict with the great and almighty Voldemort is still out there, and they did some really good and terrible scenes too represent his cruelty (Especially something we can notice in the opening scene). Hogwarts territory's are explored much more than ever in the fourth instalment, for example the lake, new areas and so. Harry Potter played by Daniel Radcliffe is showed now as a troubled, unsure and scared boy, that clearly can feel new problems coming, was great! His performance was much stronger and darker in here, his role was settled on a different level, as well as his friends, Ron and Hermione, performed by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Rector Dumbledore was also a character that came more in and out, but was clearly better included compared to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". The new teachers are always something cool and interesting, and it was once again fun too watch them in action. Speaking of action, amazing action sequences! Great camera filming, scenography, visual effects, and build-up with great suspense. Unexpected turns and uses of camera that hasn't been used in Harry Potter before, like underwater scenes and so. The music by Patrick Doyle isn't that iconic compared to the themes by John Williams, but it's rememberable and overall well written. In the end, The Goblet of Fire was entertaining, dark, mysterious and so far the best one!"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),Where grown-ups are separated from kids,"I don't recollect the last time I have seen this movie, but probably it wasn't dubbed. I took the change with my oldest son, as his age almost matches PG's requirements and we took the journey together and it was a marvelous one - maybe it the end of it he would, finally, touch the books themselves. Harry's bunch is starting to face teenagers' stuff, boys are noticing girls, hormones are bursting out and you can see envy and competition as part of their day to day activities. Even Hermione is not reacting as her usual self to some of the situations. Clearly is reflected properly by young Emma Watson. At this movie we got another two brilliant British stars as Brendan Gleeson and David Tennant joined the cast and provided brilliant performances. Another two young and promising actors has joined for a one-time performance: Robert Pattinson and Clémence Poésy, I got the feeling we will hear about them in the near future. The rest of the cast stayed the same and the plot became darker and more mature, as for the young love stories of the main characters. At the end of this film I could not say or remember if I ever though that one of Harry Potter's films are not great, from what I see until now, it seems that none of the movies is less then fantastic. It holds for all the runtime, made with beautiful cinematography and is a visually treat, though this one is at the dark and dark water, for some of it. The musical score is epic and the actors we grew up with, turns into young adult and talented actors, through out of the movies. Cant find any reasons not to be almost fully satisfied."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),"Dynamic Duels, Internal Strife, and Mystical Marvels","If I were to pick a favorite chapter in this incredible saga, it would be this one. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire encapsulates many elements that I cherish in a film, including dynamism, conflicts, and mysteries. The eagerly anticipated Triwizard Tournament unfolds with dynamism, introducing us to the enchanting worlds of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The three challenging tasks showcase the magical essence of the Harry Potter universe, immersing us in a fantastical spectacle. Amidst the external spectacle, internal conflicts within our beloved trio-Harry, Ron, and Hermione-take center stage. Strains emerge between Ron and Harry, followed by tensions between Ron and Hermione. This installment serves as a crucial test of their friendship, a test they navigate with remarkable finesse, solidifying the resilience of their bond. Beyond the visible trials, the film plunges us into a web of mysteries. The primary enigma revolves around the identity of the individual who entered Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, triggering unforeseen consequences. Another mystery centers on the mysterious figure aiding Voldemort's return to power. Additionally, the character of Alastor Moody raises questions about his true identity, with the audience kept guessing whether he has taken Polyjuice Potion. The revelation towards the end adds an unexpected twist, surprising even those familiar with the narrative. As I revisited this chapter, I found myself rediscovering forgotten details, such as the uncertainty surrounding Alastor's true form. The film successfully maintains a balance between the magical spectacle of the Triwizard Tournament and the intricate layers of the unfolding mysteries. Goblet of Fire leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the resolution of lingering questions. Despite the sadness that comes with reaching the midpoint of the saga, the film sets the stage for the intense and emotionally charged events that await in the subsequent installments. As I eagerly approach the final four films, I find myself both exhilarated and already lamenting the inevitable hiatus until the next cinematic journey through the wizarding world."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),Superbly dark with some great laughs too.,"A superb entry in the Harry Potter franchise. The film explores a great range of emotions in our characters as they continue to mature. The tone is dark tone yet mixed in with some comic relief too. Bleaker, greyer, skies and a cooler blue outdoor colour palette hint at troubled times on the horizon for our gang. Cracks start to appear in the friendship between characters only to be strengthened later on. The sense of threat towards Harry increases too in this film, in the first couple it seems Harry might be hurt during his adventures, adventures that he himself chooses. In this film however it seems danger is out to find Harry, to put it simply somebody wants him dead, and you don't need much imagination to imagine who. The film is set almost exclusively inside Hogwarts which I thought worked well. The casting of Brendan Gleeson was also in my opinion an inspired choice."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),You will have to choose between what is easy and what is right,"Harry and his friends are now young ladies and gentlemen. An international Quidditch event is taking place. To get there one has to use a port key (an innocuous-looking device that transports one to a different location). Things did not go as well as planned and now a dark element has been added. Also, this year is the tri-wizard tournament in which a hero from each of three learning institutes must compete in unknown events. This is to promote friendship among the institutes. The opportunity is open to only potential contestants of seventeen years. They must enter his/her name into the goblet of fire for selection. So, you can imagine everyone's surprise to find fourteen-year-old Harry's name in the Goblet. How did his name get in the goblet? Will Harry accept the challenge? And if so, how will he fair? We get to see all the characters for the book come to life. Most of the relevant story is included. Among the parts that were left out, I was hoping for the Blast-Ended Skrewts and the male wizard wearing the dress to get plenty of air around his private parts. The series of Harry films has also matured with each rendition. It took several tries, some better than others, but this one has the feel of the book and even with the short time it plays shows the real feel of the ongoing story of the struggle between Harry and him, who must not be named. This includes the larger picture of more than just good versus evil."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),I saw them all,It is a phantasy play. You mean sometimes book is as film given. Story is phantastical in showing possible(!) ways of muggles and magic things. Harry taken to write down his own fail was hard to see. For me as an adult. She a horror by knowing her in another eay cause she is an actor. Action hard with life. But it is a special with the non muggled way. The way harry got waldemord costs long distance. This given away special magic stick cause it was not harry or not the right person. The slave given a sock changes his mind. It could do so. Phantasy good. Must not be in teal life. Bit it is am entertainment.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),High School Drama Meets Dragon Drama,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005) receives a bewitching 4 stars from me, largely for its ability to blend teenage angst with dragon-taming antics in a way that makes puberty seem like a walk in the Forbidden Forest. The film introduces the Triwizard Tournament, a magical competition so intense it makes the SATs look like a game of bingo. Harry, our bespectacled hero, finds himself mysteriously entered into this tournament, and let's just say it's more pressure than finding a date to the Yule Ball. Director Mike Newell deserves a tip of the Sorting Hat for balancing the dark, impending doom of Lord Voldemort's return with the light-hearted, hormone-fueled drama of Hogwarts' students. The highlight? The underwater sequence where Harry grows gills and attempts to save his friends, proving that even in the wizarding world, high school is still about popularity contests and saving face - or in this case, saving Ron's face. The film, however, isn't without its flaws. The pacing zips through important plot points faster than a Firebolt, leaving non-book readers to puzzle over details like ""Who is Barty Crouch Jr. And why does he twitch like that?"" But overall, ""Goblet of Fire"" casts a charming spell, complete with teenage wizards, temperamental dragons, and dance floor disasters. It's a magical ride through adolescence, with just a touch of life-threatening peril - because what's high school without a little existential dread?"
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),Actually a good movie,"Watched this for the first time in a long time and it's better than I remember. It's both easy to understand for families AND dramatic/interesting. There's good plot movement throughout with minimal fluff (although I could do without the teen drama and the dance) The story is great fun centering on the tournament. The opening with the quitich (sp?) tournament being crashed by death eaters thrusts you into the action. And sets a scary backdrop for the tournament that follows. There's always an air of menace throughout. Setting up the 3rd act with the port key trophy was clever. It was satisfying seeing Harry save Cedric and choose to win together - only to face death shortly after. It's the turning point in the HP franchise. It has the first death, a notably darker tone, and formally introduces Voldemort - who is excellently portrayed by Ralph Finnes. The CGI still holds up - despite being almost 20 years old. It's great to see Robert Pattinson here."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),Not That Bad a Step-Down,"Definitely a step-down from the previous one but I feel like it's not that deep. The structure and the visual elements are not that sophisticated but it's not that bad. I feel like this one is the most enjoyable, given its ""light"" tone and the change on a story level from the previous three with the Triwizard tournament and the introduction of new characters, adapting that tone to the growth of our characters and us as an audience. This one will always be a confort film for me; as I was younger I used to truly feel and love - I still do - the romantic tone of this one; and the devastating effects that love had on our grown up characters, somehow reflecting myself in those fights and dreamy, romantic scenarios of Hogwarts on Christmas's Eve."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005),Not the book! Still amazing,"I haven't read the books because I don't want to base my opinion on a comparison to them. This movie was amazing, different from the first 2 movies, but amazing. I hate reading ""reviews"" where the only thing they talk about is how different the movies are from the books, and you should avoid them too. It's impossible to make a movie based on a 750 page book and keep it under 4 hours long unless you skip over some parts. If you want the whole story read the books, if you want to see magical stuff and still follow Harry Potter's story in Hogwarts from a cinematic perspective, then watch the film, it's awesome. I give this a 9/10 only because I always thought I'd see more of Ron and Hermione in the films, but that kind of faded away after the second one. Also not much of Draco Malfoy as I was expecting. Although that's not cause of a bad film or story, but because of my flash expectations, it still took a little bit of magic from my experience. The other thing that I didn't like was how dark the movie was, although it's understandable and it suits the story that we follow in this film, I always thought of the Wizarding World as something more cheerful, colorful and magical in a different way, but again, that's my wrong image of HP before watching it. I'm really excited to watch the 5th one and the rest of the movies. Already feeling kinda sad that it's gonna end for me soon. I want to live in the Wizarding World myself!"
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Quirky Dark-Comedy...Bizarre Surreal Characters & Cartoon-Like Behavior,"Prolific Actor and Occasional Director, John Flattery Takes the Helm in this Dark Comedy that has Unmistakable ""Fargo"" Vibes. Actors John Hamm and Tina Fey Lead a Quirk-Character Cast of Misfits, Losers, Low-Life-Criminals, as an Awkward Coupling of Post-Marriage 30-Somethings. He, with His Wife Passing, and She with a Divorce from a Dominating Husband (that She can't seem to avoid meeting-up with). The Plot has the Mystery of 2 Murders, only Days Apart, Both Victims with the Name Maggie Moore. Everyone in this Fictional Small Town is a Character Worthy of Sensationalized Paper-Back Fiction. Exaggerated, Full of Colorful Quirks, Mostly a Step Slow with the Characters Designed to Entertain and Propel the Lurid Plot, Filled with Violence and Charmless Charm.

It's that Counterpart to the ""Normal"" or Usual Mystery, Drama, Romance, and Crime, Story that Sets the Type Apart. Over-Reaching, as if On-Cue, to the Events that Causes these Folks to Over-React in a what at Times Seems Like Something Out of a Cartoon.

They Love the Cult-Status that Makes these Movies a Different Experience from the Straight-Laced, Familiar, and Safe Movie Offerings that ""Stays Within the Lines"". For those Fans, it's... Worth a Watch For Fans of the Traditional Take... Not so Much."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),A satisfactory one time watch,"This movie is a nice viewing on a popcorn and a movie kinda night. It starts off a bit slow and meandering. Cards are all laid out on the table, you're watching a decent murder investigation with no real questions because you already know what's going on. But the third act comes in hot with an OMG WTF that launches into a rather tense finale with some real stakes and a fairly satisfying ending. I think movies like this need support. It's okay to sit through a movie that isn't force feeding you ""action"" all the time. It's okay to let a movie marinate. It's okay to sit through the beats rather than constant jump cuts. The language was a bit much for me. But overall, a decent independent movie at a time when Hollywood needs to return back to decent original movies."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),I totally enjoyed it,"What a pleasant surprise. This is one of those movies I usually hesitate to see because the poster and description don't really appeal to me and then I find out I wouldn't have wanted to miss out on it. I agree with the reviews, it is a breath of fresh air with dialogues to die for and much better than it looked. It has that kind of witty humor that makes you laugh in such a fun way, you can't help but like totally enjoy it. Some mentioned it's rather a slow burner, but I've watched a lot of slow burners - and I'm talking here only about the good ones since this movie definitely doesn't belong to the bad category, and those good slow burners were much slower than this one. In my opinion the pace was quite good because not once did it make me feel bored. Like I said, I totally enjoyed it, I mean like REALLY enjoyed it!! It's a movie you can watch twice in case you wanna share it with your friends and go with it a second time."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),"a ""wanna be"" Breaking Bad murder mystery","Pros: 1. Romance between Hamm and Fey. Great Chemistry here. Their relationship seemed pitch perfect for their age and personality. I would love to see them again in a rom-com. They seemed natural vs that latest yell match of a rom-com of Julia Roberts in her daughter's wedding. 2. I loved the views of my Sandia Mountains. The Sandia mountains loom over everything in ABQ, and they did a great job including them in the background of many of the scenes. Cons: 1. Seemed like they tried to make a murder mystery in the Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul playbook. There are Scenes of funky architecture, dialogs inside crazy diners, murder in a 1950's era concrete apartment and another crime scene located out in the desert. Most of us from Albuquerque don't go to half these places. 2. Murder mystery? ...there was no mystery here. We know who killed who from the very beginning and so did most of the protagonists. Most reviewers mentioned that they tried to make a Cohen brothers/Fargo type story focusing on character development than mystery. 3. And lastly, an indian (from India) actor? I know there are Indians in NM, but I've lived here, worked here, and taught here most of my life and never met a single one. NM has the largest population of hispanic and native Americans and they couldn't find one to play the deputy or any other character? Some TV shows/movies go crazy with diversity, but not having a single Hispanic actor in a US Southwestern locale is like not having an Italian or African American actor in a NY scene."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Better Than Vengeance,"Slattery got it right with this slow burn of a dark comedy. The movie succeeds in doing what ppl raved that Vengeance did last year. I was highly impressed w/this movie & it didn't get half the hype as Vengeance. I found performances spot on & nuanced. The movie flows seamlessly from outlandish situations to believable niche characters that I enjoyed. Fey & Hamm have great chemistry as a hapless divorcee & a buttoned up widower, brought together by these murders. I was delighted watching the idiotic Hubby Moore rely on original murderous deaf guy to clean up this mess, more murders. I highly recommend this movie, it's quirky, well cast, & well done unraveling mystery."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Weird and fun,"I'm surprised so many reviews are saying this movie isn't good. It's exactly what it's billed as: a dark comedy. Jon Hamm and Tina Fey are fantastic in their roles. The other actors are wonderful and don't miss a beat. You never know what's gonna happen next, which is especially gratifying in the current film landscape of sequels and reboots. I enjoyed every strange, off-kilter moment of this, and the ending is pitch-perfect. A delightful film except for the inexcusable outcome for Deputy Reddy. If you like the Coen brothers' movies, you should connect with this - it very much strikes the same notes as Raising Arizona and Fargo - lots of death and deadpan characters."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Slattery trying to find the laughs in manslaughter.,"At the library saw this recent movie with Tina Fey and Jon Hamm, so thought it would be worth a shot at something my wife and I could enjoy together. Early on it starts out with some of the crime action, that many others have pointed out is a tricky pairing with comedy. It jettisoned my wife for sure. But I stuck around... The problem is not just that it's a crime/comedy, but the comedy is often pretty dry and well the crime is not embezzling, but let's say much wetter. Another problem is some of the absolutely stupid behavior by the ""crooks"" contrasted with the more sharp-witted dialog. Tina Fey leans hard into her ugly ducking role, but her attractive personality plus kind of belies that. Well, then there is her ex-husband with benefits, that was sort of part of the dry humor. I noticed another review thought it was John Goodman as the assassin who has some tricks up his extra-large sleeves. But no, I think it was his stunt double. The subtle work just gets murdered by the heavier overriding plot points. It's like admiring your kids chalk work on pavement drawing well within the police chalked body outline. Hard to shake that off-feeling. Maybe instead of trying to go Fargo, John Slattery (Hamm's old pal from Mad Men, in his 2nd full length each time with a star from that successful show)....maybe Slattery could have gone further into David Lynch territory. Even that might not have worked, here in the US with our requisite patriotic level of fear of some random act of violence, I think it's hard to laugh at mistaken identity womanslaughter. Bottom line the film ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Damn shame as the cast and ideas I do feel like could have been forged into something uniquely successful."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Very enjoyable diversion,"I don't see a lot of new movies because they're (in my opinion) usually overdone and too slick. In case you don't know, police departments aren't full of computer nerds and hot 20-somethings. Middle-aged Tina Fey and Jon Hamm caught my eye and the 'black comedy' description led me to give it a shot. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was quirky and oddball and not Formula Hollywood at all; almost Coen Brothers. I was surprised that Tina Fey was not a write or producer, and given the lengthy list of producers, she may have just asked that her name be omitted. So it's not Billy Wilder and 'Sunset Boulevard,' but it's an engaging and entertaining tale, with (possibly unfamiliar) actors delivering spot-on performances."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),"Much, much better than it looked","Despite other reviews, I felt like everything actually works really well. It's light and dark, but never so serious or jokey that the tone shifts are off-putting. The writing is really effective - it's a bit of a morality piece, but each scene is so well constructed and enjoyable and never heavy-handed. Nothing over the top, all very low-key. And the lead roles are so well delivered, there's something very Fargo-esque about how everything unfolds and the quality of the performances. The sweet, effective cop, and the spiraling criminal. Perfect stay-at-home date night movie. Can't help but wish the Jon Hamm character becomes recurring."
Maggie Moore(s) (2023),Has a Fargo Vibe,"This is not a whodunnit. We know very early in the film what the main story is: a small town business man wants to get rid of his wife. So this is a ""how-catch-him."" Like an episode of Columbo, the suspense is generated by watching how the detective (Jon Hamm) puts together the clues. It's a tad more complex for him because there are two victims with the same name and thus twice as many suspects, red herrings and a neat Chekov's gun. But since we know who is behind the plot (which goes a lot farther than he intended), the real attraction, as in the movie Fargo, is the characters. Hamm is wonderful as the down-to-earth but very observant police chief, supported by his odd deputy. Tina Fey gives her best acting performance ever by going against type as the self-defacing but nosy neighbor who starts out as a witness and becomes the object of a rather sweet romantic subplot. Like Fargo, there is some violence but it is not graphic by today's standards. A very enjoyable film that will not give you nightmares if you watch it just before bed."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),"Very dumb, bad, and disappointing.","This is very obvious to say because why else would I be watching this, but I'm a huge Monk fan, like huge. I've watched the entire show over 6 times. It's in my top 5 shows of all time, a 10/10. It has a certain atmosphere and feel to it that not many shows can do. A formula that is fun to watch every episode. Saying Tony Shalhoub was born for this role is an understatement. I could watch 40 seasons of Monk doing his amazing detective thing and laughing along. So safe to say I absolutely love the show with all my heart. Which brings me to this movie... What a huge disappointment. This does not feel like Monk at all, regardless of how many references and known characters appearing in it. It's very dumb, generic, and boring. Other than Tony Shalhoub, the acting feels like one of those generic terrible action movies that Bruce Wills start in. It just looks bad and uninspired. Like the way his daughter acts after her beloved partner gets murdered is so stupid, she cries for a little bit at first but then soon after it's like nothing happened and she acts like she wants a murder solved for an acquaintance not a partner, you can see her like smiling after Monk says something weird on the bridge. And there are so many illogical stuff that happens it's crazy. What a coincidence that Leland works as a head of security for the evil guy. And what a miracle he survived fall of a cliff by hanging on to that inflatable doll, like that made my jaw drop of how forced and stupid that was, and of course the evil guy has to do a speech or say something witty before shooting monk, a staple in dumb movies. And how did Monk even get the evil guy arrested? I don't understand. Like ok he said what he did with the measuring tape, but that does not prove anything lol. Like no fingerprints, no eyewitness, no nothing. Just ""here's what happens"" like they even have no evidence on the guy that broke in the house, let alone the evil guy who was in a different place and can no way be connected to the murder. And if anyone says ""oh but the laptop"", he would've destroyed any evidence after seeing Monk stealing his laptop. No explanation at all of how he got arrested, no proof, just the script wanting to be over with to wrap up the movie. And that cringy ending oh my goodness! With dead people wearing white and even people he doesn't know and literally never seen and still in the freezer hahaha, talk about subtility huh? And all the dead people walking in a crowd with the generic music in the background, like can you make it any more cheesy? There are a lot of stuff to mention, and setting aside the stupid plot holes and illogical stuff, the movie just looks and feels bad, it doesn't feel like the people who made it have talent or even cared, and budget had nothing to do with it, it's just a movie made by a generic director who (surprise surprise) made absolutely nothing before this and his qualifications are ""I love Monk TV show and I have a degree in movie directing"""
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),There should be a trigger warning.,"There should have been a trigger warning for people who struggle with mental health issues. Why display a hotline number at the end? It should have been put in the beginning of the movie so watchers are aware of what they are about to see. This was not a comedy. It was sad, depressing and dark. There's nothing wrong with a movie that displays those issues but there has to be a clear warning for those who don't want to watch something grim and depressing. Watching people struggle with mental health issues isn't funny. This movie wasn't a comedy and it wasn't even a good movie at that. Thank you."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),He's Back!,"The quirky, OCD, germaphopic & now-retired detective, Monk is back in this very special ""last case"" movie. While the final episode of the series left us with a Monk that was on the road to normalcy after finally solving his wife's murder, we find him back to his old ways as he is asked to solve the murder of his step-daughter's fiancé. All of the ingredients that made the series great are here (funny OCD behaviors, mystified family and collaborators, serious investigative moments) and especially all (minus Sharona) of Monk's most important friends. Viewers should be aware that a strong theme of suicidal ideation runs the length of the film, fueled by Monk's continuing grief at the absence of his wife and his strong desire to be with her (in death). Rest assured, Monk's hand is staid by regular appearance of his wife, pleading with him not to go through with his plans. In the end, after the crime is solved, and as Monk prepares to overdose in a public park, both his wife and the fiancé appear to show him how his presence in the world gave a voice to those that could not speak for themselves. The film ends with dozens of apparitions walking with him in recognition of the peace he brought to so many families through the homicides he solved, as Monk heads toward the precinct to again, offer his services in solving cold cases. Monk's Final Case is by no means riveting drama. But it's fun, touching, meaningful, and a great capstone to a wonderfully different detective series."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Dissapointed,"I love watching Monk shows and was so hopefully for this movie version. It is extremely predictable, lacks Monk's sad-sack ending which creates the loveable loser, and has poor acting by everyone but Tony Shalhoub. Somewhat embarrassing especially with the heavy-handed Suicide prevention angle. The best Monk shows are quotable, memorable, fun and quirky. This was none of those features. I gave it two stars because I love the characters and the original actors. But that's a reminiscing review. It's still clean, mostly free from current issues (with the exception of an in your face gay character from the beginning) but otherwise a big disapointment."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Basically a long episode of Monk,So I was pleased (and surprised) to see this pop up out of nowhere. If you are a fan of Monk then you will probably like this as it follows pretty much the same type of format as the TV show but with one (rather dark) overshadowing theme. Making this film so long after the series has its draw backs - there is a certain amount of exposition as people new to the show are caught up and the absence of other characters is explained. Once it gets going it is the normal cheesy detective show that I have grown to love so much. Having a longer run time doesn't really add much and there is nothing special about it being a film - but I am fine with that it is perfect as it is. This (as the title suggests) is a farewell show and it has a marked degree of poignancy. An extra star for pulling back the original cast.
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Excellent! Excellent!,"The movie was fantastic, and Tony Shaloub once again portrayed the character perfectly. People with his condition rarely ever change, so expecting a happy ending to the series to carry over into this movie would have been unrealistic. Other reviews stated they did not like it because it did not follow the series final episode. Why would it? Monk is quirky, will always be quirky, and that is what makes him loveable. I enjoyed seeing the old characters, would have been nice to see his first assistant and their adult children too just for fun. Otherwise, a perfect movie for everyone who has followed the series. Thanks Peacock for this movie."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),One Last (Touching) Stroll Down The Streets of San Francisco.,"After the resolution all those years ago of solving the series-long mystery of who killed Trudy, I wondered how they could top it with this. The answer- they couldn't...But it was still nice to see the cast together again. Got choked up at times and while it felt more like a new run-of-the-mill episode than a final bang, certain elements and especially that one visual near the end in the field made it worth it. And all through the pandemic I, like millions of others I'm sure, wondered how Monk would react which I'm sure was a driving force behind the creation of this special. Some of the acting could've been better (although the show sometimes had hokey acting) but the returning main cast elevated it all. Long live Monk- whether he wants to or not."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Who was this character,"I fully realize every opportunity to make money off of nostalgia is explored and monetized but to recreate a character and leave out all that made it good before is a vast disservice to the fan base. I was very much looking forward to one more round quirky humor but wondered ""how can they do Monk in a world where you are not allowed to find humor in disability, how will they take write OCD lines as funny without causing an outrage?"" Answer was, they didn't. They made him a sad, depressed man without any of the quirky humor that offset the troubled mind. Monk was always the only one that didn't realize he was just fine. Now, he fully makes you believe that it just isn't worth it, solving all the cases, making any effort, you go through this without understanding fully why he is suicidal, but just wishing he would get on with it. Cringe is what is left. Over the top cringe. Skip this and remember it fondly, don't destroy your memories of Monk with this abomination."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Missed Sharona...,"I enjoyed the film but missed Sharona Fleming. She was Adrian's nurse and assistant and was written off halfway through season three (apparently over a pay dispute). I adored Sharona and Monk's relationship - unlike Natalie, Sharona favored the tough love approach when it came to her boss. Despite the low pay and Monk's many phobias, you can tell she genuinely cared and wanted Adrian to get better. Although Bitty Schram returned for an episode of the show's final season, her character was never given proper closure. I can't really think of anyone I've ever talked to who liked the faulty concept of her going back to her ex and then marrying Randy. I think the writers were too lazy and she deserved much better than that. Schram's contribution to the show's success was immense and I think she deserved to be in the final episode as much as Natalie or Randy."
Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (2023),Mr. Monk GAVE ME HOPE,"2023 has been propably the worst year of my life i reached a new personal low mostly mentally. This movie reminded me that in the times you are unable to help yourshelf you can always help others also you can think you are useless but somewhere, someone appreciates you and your effort dont give up keep fighting. Just brilliant message by the movie Also Tony Shalhoub i dont know how he does after all this years but he is still inch perfect as our beloved Detective Mr. Monk. The comedy is still there and its not over the top as its happens with newer shows/movies. If you were fan of the show this movie is a must watch."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Agatha Christie meets Frankenstein's monster,"If all the paragraphs that were cut from the final draft of Agatha Christie's stories were sewn together you would end up with something like this. If I was being kind I would call it a homage, if I was being truthful I would call it a rip-off. I admire the ambition of Ch5 to broadcast new(ish) drama to a UK audience on a limited budget but by broadcasting this at Christmas they were trying to fool us into thinking this was a genuine Christie story while we were all too drunk to notice. None of the characters were convincing, some of them barely existed at all. The story came to a sudden and unsatisfying end, I assume they ran out of plot and/or money."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Shocking,"No point in wasting too much time reviewing this truly horrendous mash up of a film. It is an insult to Agatha Christie, an insult to the actors and, above all an insult to the viewers. The plot meanders painfully around the Christie plot but with none of the elegance and suspense. The acting by every single member of the cast is wooden and unconvincing. Every single one of them was there for the money and nothing else it would seem. The set is pure American, no English country house has ever looked like this in it's unconvincingness. And then there are the appalling computer graphics presumably done by a student on day release. And what's with the rabbits ? Pointless and useless, like the film."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Quite awful,"First off, the script is horrible - some of the lines and the exchanges are very amateurish, plus, with the acting so so so bad, the delivery of those lines were even more awful. Based on the outside filming, it's also obvious that this was filmed in the USA and not Britain - the manor house screamed a McMansion. That only contributed to the overall crappiness of the film. The gist of the story would definitely work if the writing (and acting) weren't so bad - it had an interesting core focus and that focus could get a good murderfest going. Alas, it was not meant to be. Even when the culprit was revealed, it was a torturous journey of enlightenment for us still watching at this point."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),unsatisfying and pointless,"This is quite an odd film - as you can tell from the widely varying reviews here. It looks good, has obviously been funded well, the acting is OK, it should be a good watch, like a well-intentioned Agatha Christie pastiche, made presumably with an eye on the US market. And yet, after a promising-enough start, it starts to fall apart. I think it's the poor pacing, the lack of tension or excitement, the sluggishness, the intrusive music, perhaps. The plot wasn't particularly involved or complicated. But by the end - at the long drawn out and unlikely and undramatic denouement - the end result was a feeling of dissatisfaction. All the well-intentioned effort had fizzled out. And the final reveal of an intensive closed-circuit TV system with sophisticated monitoring facilities, multiple cameras and monitors - in 1934! - suddenly made me realize how utterly daft the whole thing had been, and the whole enterprise collapsed in ludicrous hilarity."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Extremely poor Agatha Christie rip-off!,"Extremely poor Agatha Christie rip-off!! (Of whom I'm a massive fan!) I was really looking forward to this, however it has a disappointingly long drawn-out mish-mashed plot! Absolutely dire acting - Mischa Barton seems totally out of place & awkward, very false acting abilities! Only positives are the costumes & settings, which I suspect were recored in America & not the UK! Now I've started it, feel I've got to see it through to the end - what a waste of 2 hours!!! In other words, don't bother people - no wonder it went straight to television - if it had been released to cinemas - people would've walked out in their droves!!!"
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Enjoyable enough murder mystery.,"Six strangers receive invites to the home of Millionaire Lewis Findley, when they arrive their host is absent, they anxiously wait to learn their purpose for being there. The first couple of minutes all seemed to point to one thing, a reworking of And then there were none, the ultimate Whodunnit, we had the strangers, the island, the invitations, that's where the similarities end. Let's be honest, it's nonsense, but if you are fan of mysteries and whodunnits, you may just get some enjoyment out of it, there are some interesting moments, and the story has a few clever ideas. For me, it had the look and feel of a stage play, entertaining enough, maybe a little rough around the edges at times. The accents are a little hit and miss, and at no point does it feel as though it's England, I've not checked the production details, but I'm assuming The States or Canada. Mischa Barton does a fine job, more Fletcher than Marple, but pleasing enough. Chris Browning stole the show for me, I enjoyed his performance. 6/10."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Wrong on so many levels,"Predictable sub-par acting as was the plot. Each of the characters veiled history was evident from the offset. The acting was poor aside from the ""gum shoe"". Dialogue was very poor - trying too hard to be English I feel. The main protagonist being Misha who in her dialogue expressed a wish or insight using two ""long words"" which in effect meant the same, and really there was not need. The worldly men who apparently are doctors and solicitors appeared trite, ineffective, play boy'ish and rather dense - considering they were supposed to be men of learning. We DO NOT have crickets in England, so an inaccuracy on the part of the script writer and the director. Pretty poor all in all."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Very Poor version,"This is yet another version of the Agatha Christie book, 'Ten Little Indians'. Why anyone thought another version was needed I've no idea, The acting was poor and very mushy, with no outstanding performances. Whereas the original pitted the characters against each other, this version has a woman who seems to believe she is some kind of detective. The other characters just wash around each other doing nothing in particular. There is also a whole load of rabbits involved, but I have no idea what they were doing. When you have such a masterpiece as Agatha Christies original work, it is outrageous that anyone should mess it around like this."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),Worst so called British accents I have ever heard,"I watched this expecting it to be a bit like Agatha Christie's ' And then there were none' as the publicity seemed to indicate it was similar. Oh dear what a mess! Apart from Alex Hyde White, not one of the cast could speak with a passable British accent at all. Either it was a poor parody or otherwise it kept slipping into something else. The script was obviously written by an American with many American words or phrases that sounded quite ridiculous with a pseudo British accent. Many inaccuracies for the period the worst being that British police do not and never have carried guns except under specific circumstances - not a routine murder. Would have been far better to set this in America, then it wouldn't have grated so much."
Invitation to a Murder (2023),The stars are for Blunder,"I was so looking forward to this. Sounded just up my street but unfortunately it was dire. It started off with promise but the acting was poor as was the writing. Mischa Barton was terrible. Didn't quite carry it off. I give almost full marks though for the setting. The house and props were wonderful and deserving of a very juicy mystery. What a shame it fell flat. The outstanding star of the show was Blunder, the dog. What a wonderful doggy actor. He outshone the humans by miles. I actually give 10 stars to him. He was amazing. I've fallen for him and hope to see him in many more films. A little darling."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),"Weird and not great, although Florence Pugh shines","One of Florence Pugh's better performances but too bad about the rest of it. Cleverly written but weird and convoluted on screen. Set in a not so idyllic '50s community that to say the film packs a twist is not at twist at all. It's disingenuous, easy, cheeky - much like the film itself, which starts off strong before crumbling into baffling storytelling choices made worse by the revolting intentions behind them. More frustrating is that the film also offers stunning craft work, a wonderfully immersive quality. In short, It is less than the sum of Florence Pugh's performance. Despite great chemistry between Pine and Pugh and amazing production & costume design, the obvious and nonsensical plot and Harry Styles' unconvincing performance ultimately sinks up the film."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),A stylish film!,"The drama surrounding 'Don't Worry Darling's' release had me quite concerned about how it would impact the film's quality. However, I found that the film succeed despite all this behind-the-scenes chaos! I absolutely adored the film's style and the way it fit into the narrative. Upon a second watch, you will notice subtle things in the film that you did not see the first time. Plus, there was some creative cinematography techniques utilised that supported these two film elements. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine gave fantastic performances. However, I feel Harry Styles performance stood out a bit compared to them. There were a few times that a different take of Harry's performance should have been utilised instead of what made it into the film. Although, I feel he did have a unique chemistry with Pugh! There are a few inconsistencies, but they did not impact the film too severely. Overall, I would definitely recommend seeing this! It is one of my favourites of the year and I enjoy non-franchise films getting support."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),It doesn't make sense,"I honestly wasn't aware of all the real-world drama surrounding the film, and I certainly wasn't offended by it. But I have to say, on its own merits, this film just doesn't make sense in the end, mostly due to a lack of world-building. Why did the red plane appear? What was the deal with the eggs? Why did she get smooshed against the glass? Does the bus driver know he's in a simulation? Why does Frank's wife stab him? The more you think about this film the less sense it makes. Even though most of the good reviews I find seem to admit it's lacking. I think it's benefitting from its controversy because people are rating it higher in support of the message and not judging the actual film."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),Secrets,"Florence Pugh, Harry Styles and Chris Pine are excellent in this film set in 1950's America in a secret society living in a remote area,free from civilization and society's issues and problems. A society built on deception and lies and brainwashing. Very suspenseful and lots of sexual encounters. Thanks to the strength of one wife this secret society is about to get turned upside down. This is the storyabout chaos and mis adventures of a community of people looking for a better life and pursuit of happiness for a select group of people chosen by the society's leadeship. Great soundtrack and i suggest mature audiences only."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),LEFT WANTING MOREEE,I really was hooked and intrigued the whole time.. some of the head scratching momentd in the movie u can think of the reasons behind ... but some the movie just gives you no answers to... tooo many plot holes to be left with so little answers! The main big reveal was so shocking and great! But the ending was just so rushed and left us in the dark it feels like. But all around very intriguing movie with a great plot twist you cant see coming. I just want to know what happens after.. What happens when she wakes up does anyone come for her? What about the other women?? I will buy a book if there is one just to find out!
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),"A thriller worth seeing that is reminiscent of ""Stepford"".","A movie that is really fun right from the start for all those who are enthusiastic about the 50s. The setting is really great, the music is really fun, the great cars of the time. Everything is seen through rose-tinted glasses, and you quickly realize that this is just a facade. But that also makes it exciting, because you want to know what's behind it. Good-looking actors and actresses, beautiful fashion and the details of the set are a joy. The choreographed departure of the men, as well as the behavior of those involved, is reminiscent of ""The Stepford Wives"". Thriller / psychological thriller / mystery, it all fits and I wanted to know what was behind it. I was very entertained until the final resolution. The light-hearted, almost dreamlike start, which put me in an absolute good mood, then changed and even then it was interesting to see what happened and I was able to get excited. Only the resolution/the complete ending is a matter of taste, unfortunately it wasn't my cup of tea. But the acting performance of the protagonists, as well as the setting, music and of course the cars, as well as the one or other twist in the story, make me happy to recommend this movie. -------------
Conclusion:
Worth seeing."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),It's up there,It's probably not for everyone but a great movie if you like something a little different and a bit dark and twisted. It's Black Mirror with a Stepford Wives vibe and that is right up my alley! You know when you finish a good movie or series and you instantly want to find something else that gives you that same feeling because you didn't really want it to end but rushed through it wanting to see how it ended? This is one of those. This movie was what it was because of Florence Pugh and the rest of the acting was mediocre in comparison. This role was made for her! I love an ending that can't be guessed even if it does leave you feeling a little Ill.
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),Power of women,"Experience:
While we were watching the movie we were sitting in the cinema room. It was very cold there so we brought our jackets .But the quality of the sound was perfect. Casts
The important casts were Alice Champerls,Jack,Frack,Margaret,Bunny,Peg,The new girl:Violet,And the husbands
The soundtrack:
The soundtrack was effective for everyone. We watched in silence and there was a big tension in the room. Everyone were waiting for what's going to happen. Opinion:
We absolutely loved the whole kind of feeling of the movie. It was very interesting and thoughtful. And now we have a lot of questions about the movie for example:what will happen to Alice? What Frank's wife is going to do with the victory project? Why and how was it made? Characters:
We loved the character of Alice, she was a very good actor and she empathized herself perfectly. Harry Styles seemed perfect and nobody thought he was lying to his wife about his work at the Victory Project and her whole life. So that's the reason why we liked his acting. The other characters seemed very happy and perfect too, we think that it made an important impression of the movie's atmosphere. The creators of the movie showed Frank like something was wrong with him, but we didn't know why, because everyone honored and loved him. Background:
In the background the most important things were the characters, the heavy colors everywhere and the perfect life feeling for example in the food, the houses inside,and the garden city. Summary:
We gave this title because we think that Alice was the first woman who had the power to break the ""wall of controllability"" because she lived in a world she couldn't control and everyone was against her and made her believe that she is crazy. We think that the mens in the film wanted to make a happy life for their chosen wives, but the truth is that it was their dream life, because they could control everything around them and the wives and their happiness were ""their"". In reality it's the opposite, because nowadays women have the power and the opportunities to live their lives as they want."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),This is one of those movies where you understand the whole story at the end.,"I've seen it twice. The film was set in the 50's and it's about a married couple called Alice&Jack. In the village the women's role is to clean the house and cook, their husbands work on the Victory project. The leader is Frank who tries to keep everything in secret, but Alice finds out the truth. The life of Alice in the movie was calm and perfect until she started to see her visions. I liked the music because it fits to the scenes, but sometimes it was a little terrifying. The scenery and the customs were old school, they were so colorful. The first time I saw it I was confused while I was watching it, I didn't understand what was going on and why Alice started going crazy and started seeing visions. My jaw dropped when she realized where she was and that her whole life was a massive lie. Overall, I think this is the kind of movie where you understand the whole movie in the last 5 minutes. I give it a 7/10 rate."
Don't Worry Darling (I) (2022),"Cringy plot and Harry Styles shouldn't be cast in anymore roles, he can't act lol","2 stars solely for Florence Pugh's emotionally committed performance. She pours all her acting prowess into a performance that this overhyped, pretentious, sucky film doesn't deserve one ounce of. Harry Styles is not a good actor, please stick to your manufactured pop songs lmao. Olivia Wilde, please stop making films. The screenplay tries to be ""original"" but it's NOT; it heavily borrows from Stepford Wives, Twilight Zone, and Black Mirror themes. Very predictable plot and plot twist all around. However, the cinematography is another positive aspect but besides Pugh's great performance, there's nothing else positive from this film. The runtime and pacing just kept dragging on, could not wait for this film to finally finish. Maybe worth watching once or just not at all."
Prisoners (2013),Lazy,"Overrated, contrived mess. This type of movie only exists for the stars that agreed to appear in it, they all play according to typecast. Jackman for instance with his fierce barking and stony face. Making the bad guys ""at war with God"" is just lazy, clichéd writing. Very disappointing. I suppose this is meant to be seen as a detective movie, but it doesn't have any mystery. Everything is simply given to the viewer. In the detective genre, we expect more. There's more mystery to a detective / comedy like ""the hangover"". Much of the plot is directly ripped off from the far superior ""The Pledge"". There, Jack Nicholson shows how to extend one's range. See that instead."
Prisoners (2013),A VERY GOOD UNCOMFORTABLE MOVIE,"This movie was an uncomfortable movie, and I like that a mystery to where one of our characters daughters is going missing in one of the other characters which is a cop has to find that's basically the premise of this whole, and yet is one of the directors best movies first of all the performances of this movie is top-notch, the best performance of the movie movie actually Hugh Jackman, which gives off a anti-hero vibe but the stuff is doing so brutal is so illegal, but we still side with him in some ways, Jake Jalal's character is that one character with all about the law, but see-through the events of this movie the see through the people who caused this, each character in each performance in this movie is top-notch makes you feel for every single character in this movie, especially the person who is blamed for the movie give us a little hands on who did it and when it revealed that the old lady did it. It makes a lot of sense coming from the background she had with her own children and how it affect her to take children. Also, we don't talk about in this movie is the fact of the character traits of both Jake Gyllenhaal character and Hugh Jackman character Jake Gyllenhaal Character see him is what we all have to know about him it's Thanksgiving, He's all alone at a restaurant, but when he gets that phone call, he'll stop at nothing to do. The job is probably the best character in this something that no parent should go through. The term that I will kill for my children or I'll do anything to make my children safe. It's all represented And Hugh Jackman character. Overall, this movie is highly skilled and I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves dark movies and gritty movies 9/10."
Prisoners (2013),An all time great film,"I am not speaking hyperbolically when I say this is one of the greatest films ever made. The storyline, the cinematography, the acting, the ending.... Absolutely immaculate. Hugh jackman not getting any sort of Oscar attention for his role is a travesty. As a parent of five, the tension felt during the entirety of the run time of this movie can't be over stated. The way it displays the different responses to grief etc will connect with any viewer and keeps you invested til the last second. It will leave you asking yourself: ""what lengths would I go to to bring my child home safe?"" Watch this movie. It's hard to sit through at times, but you will be glad you finished it."
Prisoners (2013),Spine Chilling!!!!,"A well told story with a great cast. I think that sums it up. However i'm so uncomfortable after watching this one Hugh Jackman steals the show but Jake Gylenhaal is not behind either. When you hear the word ""prisoners"" you might think about someone being behind bars. But it's far more complex than that. I've never thought that a 2hr 30m movie will keep on edge throught the entirety but i was wrong. Go ahead watch it. The morale factor will be tested heavily although Dylan Minette doesnt have anything to do with outcome of this movie! Paul Dano was brilliant so was David Dastmalchian!!! Not ur avg crime drama thriller."
Prisoners (2013),That ending and detective work sure was a maze,"10 years later and I'm finally watching this movie. Had I known more about the premise I would have watched it earlier as the story is great. Overall the acting is phenomenal. Jake G is one of my favorite actors. The guy who plays Alex Jones (odd they chose that as his name) is great also. This was a preview of him for his future role as the riddler. Very good. All the scenes with jackman kidnapping the suspect, questioning, torturing, everything is 100% relatable I think. I'd do the same, probably worse had I been in his situation. Especially when the dude said what he did when he was released. My issue is the maze/background wasn't really explained well. Who was the weirdo in the house? Also, the cop/detective work was really bad. It took him forever to notice the medallion being the same as the pictures. Cmon. The police were canvassing the property but didn't move vehicles or use scent dogs to search or anything at Jones house? Good god. What was the connection to the snakes? Idk there's some more but this is why it doesn't get a 10. I didn't have an issue with the length either. Just too many questions and bad police work."
Prisoners (2013),"Poor, implausible, violent for the sake of it","A detective film where the detective misses important clues and connections that the audience saw, it's all the wrong way round. I kept wondering why no one except the one detective got involved, especially after the plot thickened with other crimes being uncovered... I was expecting some sort of tension and character exploration in the relationship between the father and the detective, but no, just a lot of shouting. The things you find out in the end are a mixture of horrible and cliched. The only thought-provoking character question was whether the level of violence is the filmmakers' fault, or whether the audience enjoy and ask for this."
Prisoners (2013),A tough but worthwhile watch,"This movie feels so so different from the kinds of films Villeneuve makes these days - no epic scenery, no special effects. This is the opposite of Blade Runner 2049 or Dune in so many ways. And yet...you see the precursors. From the ways he frames certain shots to the ways he uses silence and ambient sound. The human moments shine through the rain and muck here just like they shine through the spaceships and cityscapes in his other movies. This story is a dark and disturbing puzzle that's too easy to solve and too tough to watch at points, but it's also a gifted cast being directed by a gifted director."
Prisoners (2013),A hidden truth. A desperate search.,"I have seen some of director Denis Villeneuve's films before, and he has made great films before, so a mystery crime drama with a cool cast of actors like Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal with a simple premise interested me; after watching the film, I thought this movie was fantastic. I thought the movie Prisoners (2013) was an investing film with amazing performances, great cinematography, investing characters, and a mystery that made me be on the edge of my seat while watching wondering what was going to happen next; I did not know what to expect from this film, but it takes a simple premise involving two families young daughters disappearing, and does something different where it feels like a new thing. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances throughout the whole movie; Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, who is the father of one of the families who find out their daughters are missing, he goes through a lot trying to find his daughter doing certain things in intense ways where you question if this is the right way to handle the problem while also learning issues about his character that I found interesting. Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is trying his best to find out what happened to the family's daughters and where they were taken to, as he interrogates people and finds interesting clues that might connect to the incident, you are on his side, and you want to know how all of it connects; along with Detective Loki and Keller Dover having many interactions with each other questioning each other's methods and disagreements on what should be done, which I found very interesting when watching. Also, the rest of the cast such as Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano were all fantastic, especially with Viola Davis and Terrence Howard as Nancy Birch and Franklin Birch, who is the other family who lost their daughter. I cannot talk about whoever the antagonist is in this because it would be a spoiler, but mostly it is because every character, even the main characters have questionable problems where you wonder if they themselves are good or not. The cinematography in the movie is great with there being lots of wide shots and barely any cuts between shots, with every shot looking beautiful and giving the film a cool look and feel to it that I loved watching; plus, I will add that there is no musical score in the movie most of the time, and when there is, it makes the scenes better when they are playing out making the calm and intense moments investing and enjoyable to watch because of how well they are put together. Also, the way everything felt in the movie made it feel real, and like this could happen making the feel nerve-wracking and suspenseful. Though I did love the movie Prisoners (2013), it will be a while before I decide to rewatch this film, mostly because of the dark themes, how real it looks and feels, and what the movie focuses on; other than that, I highly recommend watching Prisoners (2013) if you have not already. Director Denis Villeneuve is a great director, and this movie proves that with great performances, cinematography, mystery, and a premise that is something we have seen before but done differently to make it feel new; though this is not a film that will be easy to rewatch frequently, I still recommend giving this film a watch whenever you get a chance."

Prisoners (2013),"Oh man, it was good. Really good. Really really good","Oh man. Where do I begin. Maybe by the constant suspense, the heart breaking emotion, the passionate outstanding acting, the sharp, well executed constant twists. Oh man the movie was great. The scenery, setting, eerie music was just befitting of such a tragedy. I really really enjoyed it. Only negative is that I believe the ending should've been better. But oh man that twist at the end when we find out the kids are in the creepy grandmas basement. I was tripping man. But besides that it was perfect. Perfect. Everything. Down to the last minute details. They really did cook man. Although need to watch again for further appreciation of this masterpiece."
The Holiday (2006),A piece of crap disguised as a good thing thanks to the cast,"Practically everything here is bad, but the quartet of main actors are top notch and save some of the total catastrophe. Starting with the script, there isn't a single scene, dialogue or sequence that isn't completely cliché, it's awkward, the scenes where the main couples interact that say so, culminating in the final scene in the new year, the most cliché impossible. Direction and editing are weak, and for example, just remember the scene where Cameron Diaz is arriving at the house in England for the first time, walks through the snow all clumsy and collides with a tree, what was supposed to be a comical scene ends up being something embarrassing, so poorly done and dull. In addition to being cliché and poorly done, everything is forced in the story, nothing conveys naturalness, I have rarely seen something written with so little creativity and talent, and I like some silly rom-coms, but this one has a script that is below critics. What saves here is that, who knows how, four great actors accepted this script, and they manage to hold the wave of the bad film exclusively due to their talents, it's undoubtedly pleasant to see them acting together, even in the midst of so much nonsense. And to prove what I say, that only actors save this deception, I suggest an exercise of imagination: imagine this same film, strictly the same in all the scenes, script, dialogue, settings, direction and production, but with 4 of these modern young actors from Netflix in the places of Diaz, Winslet, Law and Black, the complete tragedy that would be. I rate it 5 out of 10 due to the great interpretation work, otherwise it would be 1 out of 10."
The Holiday (2006),"Ho, Ho, Holiday romance.","'The Holiday (2006)' is a festive rom-com that somehow runs for over two hours, making it a good deal longer than it has any right to be. It follows two women who each experience a heartbreak and decide to swap houses for the Christmas period so they can go through it alone in an entirely different location. However, fate intervenes and sends them just the men they need to get over their past loves. Positioning their new relationships almost as what saves them from their old ones is a bit problematic, I suppose, but the picture mostly dances around the issue by giving the protagonists commitment issues (on opposite ends of the spectrum) which they learn to overcome. One of the narratives is far more focused on this sort of internal development than the other, as Kate Winset's plotline more-or-less just chucks in a romance with Jack Black as a little bonus (a lot of it concerns her relationship with an ageing screenwriter, portrayed by the wonderful Eli Wallach, who helps to bring her out of her shell). This is the more interesting side of the story, for sure, but it's not given as much time as the other, far more conventional side. Thankfully, that side - which chronicles the fish-out-of-water affair between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law - is sweet and bouncy and entirely watchable. It's exactly what you'd expect from a schmaltzy, feel-good romance, but it's well-executed and does exactly what it needs to. The stuff set in L. A. is more interesting simply because it's ever-so-slightly less conventional, but it still hits pretty much all the beats you'd imagine (yet is no less successful because of it). Kate Winslet and Jack Black aren't really given enough time for their relationship to blossom and, as such, it isn't all that believable they'd fall for one another. There's a scene where Kate Winslet is acting her heart out during an eloquent and sentimental speech about how broken she feels and then Jack Black just swears, says ""you need this more than I do"" in the most Jack Black way possible and hands her a drink. Still, it's a nice enough dynamic that it doesn't feel especially jarring when they inevitably come together as the finale approaches. That's kind of the best way to describe the piece as a whole really; it's a bit rough around the edges and entirely too safe, but it all comes together surprisingly nicely. It's a good version of a generic, slightly unbelievable thing. There are a handful of chucklesome moments, a few pieces of successful sentimentality and a general formal competence that keeps you engaged despite an often uneven and slightly strange pacing. It's definitely too long, but it's also enjoyable enough for what it is. It also serves as a decent movie to watch towards the end of the year, as it starts around Christmas and ends on New Years Eve."
The Holiday (2006),So cute and so romantic,"This is almost a must to watch in Christmas season. I admit I am not a fan of rewatching the same movies every year, but once in a while this one sneaks in on my watch list on Christmas again. I love the story - even though it is a little cheesy. But the whole movie is carried by the good actors and actresses. Yes, Jude Law is sexy and all - but the performances of all 4 of the main characters is really really good. I like, that it includes all kind of elements in this movie, comedy, tragedy and love story. If there is a small minus to this movie, it's that the character of Iris is a little too sweet for me. And at times I wished the story would have gone just a little deeper. Overall a very entertaining movie, that is inviting for a lot of coziness on the sofa."
The Holiday (2006),A Movie To Come Back For The X-Mas Holidays,"I have been coming back to this movie every year during Christmas and i have no shame in admitting this is my favorite Christmas movie after Home Alone. There's something so soothing and calming effect this movie has without being overly cheesy or dramatic like most of the holiday rom-coms. The writing, the direction, the screenplay AND the acting, everything so perfectly in sync. Never felt bored for a minute. And the dialogues are so well written, nothing felt forced, they were just flowing with the pace. Coming to the cast and their performances, a lot of ppl say Cameron Diaz was just doing what she has been doing in most of her movies, but as i haven't watched much of her movies, i thoroughly enjoyed her here. But what stood out for me is a Jude Law, a Kate Winslet and a Jack Black u don't get to see very often. Most of the time Jude Law/Kate Winslet are seen in serious characters whereas Jack Black in comedy, but here, Jude Law as a rom-com hero was dream come true. And Kate and Jack as two miserable individuals with bad luck in relationships finding each other was a treat to watch, especially Kate. Like every other romantic movies, this movie is also about finding the right partner and you don't know u might find it in the most unexpected place !!!"
The Holiday (2006),"starts of weird, progresses slowly, but ends perfectly","The Holiday stars Cameron Diaz as Amanda and Kate Winslet as Iris, two young women successful at work, but not so much at finding love. Amanda has just broken up with her boyfriend that cheated on her and Iris tries to forget her ex she's in love with who just got engaged with another woman. The two decide to go on a vacation during the Christmas holidays to forget about their troubles and agree to exchange homes with each other for two weeks. In London, Amanda meets Iris' older brother, while Iris gets to meet Amanda's LA neighbor, an acclaimed, retired Hollywood screenwriter who she befriends. The movie starts of weird with some questionable stylistic choices. The first half of the movie is pretty unbalanced with regards to the two sites of the plot and has some trouble advancing the story *warning spoiler* until Amanda gets to know Graham's daughters. The big plus of this film is the ending which brings together every aspect of the movie and even raises some doubts over what will happen using temptation as a tool."
The Holiday (2006),Good alternative to watch at the end of the year festivities.,"Very interesting romantic film from its script. For a movie buff, it will have several hooks that will keep you glued to the screen waiting for more. But let's not deviate. This double story of love and heartbreak contains many elements with which the audience can identify, and it is precisely where the film finds its place. The performances of the choral cast are quite dissimilar, with one pair standing out over the other. Winslet and Law knew how to integrate perfectly into their roles, but Diaz and Black didn't. The soundtrack and the meta-narrative details are an excellent complement, which entertain and become part of the essence of the story. The main negative points, in my opinion, are not minor. Direction and editing have quite noticeable errors that at certain points manage to take you out of the natural flow of the plot. Everything else is of a fairly decent level, without standing out in a good or bad way. The film entertains, excites and makes you believe in love. Recommended as a good alternative to watch at the end of the year festivities."
The Holiday (2006),So likeable,"With Nancy Myers' films, you know that everything will be fine in the end. Sometimes I need such trivial stories and I don't care how believable they are. Especially when Kate Winslet shows up, I feel good right away because I think she's one of the top 5 actresses of the last 20 years. She plays her role in a correspondingly differentiated way, sometimes with a little too much verve, whereas Cameron Diaz falls down considerably, even if she is so likeable that you quickly forgive her for it. In addition to Jack Black's renewed attempt to play a serious role without any antics - which he once again fails to do - Jude Law makes for a clear 2:0 in the Brits versus Yanks comparison. He plays the mischievous father of two adorable little girls so charmingly that you can't help but be thrilled by his first appearance. So Nancy Myers - with a few clever cameo appearances - doesn't light a comedy fire, but a thoroughly likeable story with lots of artificial snow and an Eli Wallach in a great supporting role that goes straight to the heart. All's well that ends well."
The Holiday (2006),Most under rated movie in the history! 10/10,"The dialogs are just pure brilliance, every other sentence is a gem. The writing is so wonderful, it's that kind that makes you say : They don't make them like that anymore.. Quote from Miles about the song he wrote for Iris: I have only used the good notes.. All the mentions of gumption. It's soempowering, makes you want to get out there and live! Love the story, well all 3 stories in one. It actually got me to look into home exchange and it's proper real thing! Who knew! We have now done two successful exchanges! We watch this movie ever Christmas, it is best Christmas movie ever. Deserves much higher score than 6.9!"
The Holiday (2006),"Bad. Very, very bad.","In my opinion, this film amounts to a pile on of clichés, some awful central performances, and a nonsense of a script. In my opinion. Things that bug me about it...... Who in their right mind would abandon their dog to a complete stranger's care for two weeks? Why the dog? Give me a reason that she has a dog in the first place. Since when was LAX north of the PCH? Why could the limo not take Amanda to the front door of the cottage but Will's car could manage it from the opposite direction? Obviously we needed to see Amanda struggling down a quaint country lane in high heels with her luggage! What woman in the world, staying in a cottage in the middle of nowhere would answer the door in the middle of the night to a drunk and then let him stay the night, let alone sleep with him? For a man so keen to keep his life compartmentalised, Will all too readily invites into his daughters' lives a woman he knows nothing about. Things are over-egged, then just for good measure, egged a little more. We see both female protagonists doing ""crazy frog"" dancing to well-known tracks, harking back to the more successful Hugh Grant as PM dance in ""Love Actually"". There's just so much wrong with it! I think this film tries to emulate other, better romcoms and comes up short."
The Holiday (2006),A perfect romantic Christmas film of heartbreak and finding love,"Don't we love Christmas movies? E.g. Movies that make us feel fuzzy and feel good inside? This is one such movie. This movie tells parallel stories of two women (Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) each both having freshly coming out of heartbroken relationships. Overcome with emotions, they impetuously decide to swap homes across the the globe to getaway and have a holiday. Unexpectedly for them, love and romance ensures. It is refreshing to see a story told from a woman's perspective. We see portrayed very sensitively the various emotions that women feel as they experience events in their life. E.g. The joys and the sorrows, the anguish and the excitement and everything in-between. Women are emotional beings more so than men. Moreover, this film explores the themes of romantic interpersonal relationships, dating and love. It is a movie for young adults who want to watch a movie about romantic love, heartbreak and finding new love. The winds of change is in the air for these heartbroken souls as their destiny of finding love unfolds. What I like about this movie is that universal themes of love and romance are explored in this movie, themes we all desire and can relate to. E.g. We see the flirting glances of budding new love, to dating and getting to know someone, how the guy makes a move and kisses her, how he makes her laugh, to boldly confessing feelings to one another. We also see how the movie explores the idea of long-distance relationships and potential complications that go with that. Also, it is interesting how we form mental pictures of people in our minds based on snap judgements on how they behave or act. Only for the mental picture to reverse and change once we get to know them better. E.g. We may think a guy is hitting on a girl when he is just saying hello. Or how a guy appears to be greeting his girlfriend when he is meeting his sister. This film touches on this play of perceptions. Having watched a few romantic movies, this movie reminds me slightly of the email correspondence in You've Got Mail as the women exchange emails with one another. There is a subtle homage to the film When Harry Met Sally when Cameron Diaz's character meets her love interest (I won't spoil it). The film also features a classic romantic scene where a person realizes the errors of their ways and starts running after their lover filled with passion. All in all, I recommend this as a solid romantic movie with a Christmas theme that will definitely put you into a feel-good romantic mood by the end of it. An enjoyable watch and highly recommended!"
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),"When I saw DCH I cried, but couldn't relate to the characters, 20 years later, I could relate to these guys!!","The core idea of authenticity being a pre-requisite for human connections is bought out powerfully. The story and anecdotes had a polished authenticity to it and that to me was the biggest plus. In movies, you emphasize a few things and that contributes to the crescendo of the climax. But in real life, even the biggest events are just another bit. Marrying that mundaneness of life in a film/ story without losing the ability to grab your attention is a tough act and the makers have achieved that :) The actors, while being true to their characters, also bring out nuances. The energy with which the character of Imaad (Siddhant Chaturvedi) dances in a scene brings out his hedonism, the insecurities of Neil (Adarsh Gourav) and the absolutely delightful feminine aspects of Ahana (Ananya Panday), which I won't even try to put in words were just beautiful."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Great Movie!,"Very good movie. Something different than the action movies that have come out recently. Very interesting insights into Gen Z life and thinking!! Soooo different than how the previous generations think and live! Ananya Panday, Siddhant Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav have acted amazingly well! When actors truly get into the skin of their characters the movie becomes a delight to watch. Finally Ananya got to show her talent and boy did she shine! Siddhant is my new favorite! What an actor and an amazing portrayal of a scarred youth who had to face his truth!! The message of the movie is very relevant to today's times as well. A highly recommended watch!"
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Navigating the Digital Maze: A Poignant Tale in 'Kho Gaye Hum Kahan'.,"""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" (translating to 'Where are we lost'), directed by Arjun Varain Singh in his directorial debut, is a poignant coming-of-age drama that eloquently captures the essence of modern youth navigating life in the digital age. This 2023 Indian Hindi-language film, streaming on Netflix, delves into the intricacies of friendships, ambitions, and heartbreaks, set against the bustling backdrop of Mumbai. The film, written by Singh, Zoya Akhtar, and Reema Kagti, stars Siddhant Chaturvedi, Ananya Panday, and Adarsh Gourav as the central trio - Ahana, Neil, and Imaad. Their performances are a standout, portraying the complexities of their characters with a raw and relatable intensity. Kalki Koechlin, Anya Singh, and Rohan Gurbaxani, in supporting roles, add depth to the narrative. One of the film's striking aspects is its initial slow pace, which gradually builds up, mirroring the uncertainties and explorations of youth. This pacing beautifully complements the storyline, providing stability and depth to the narrative as it unfolds. The background score by Sid Shirodkar and the songs by a diverse group of artists like OAFF-Savera, Ankur Tewari, and Sachin-Jigar, among others, harmonize with the film's theme. While the songs may be just okay for some, they subtly underscore the film's emotional landscape. A significant strength of ""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" is its realistic portrayal of the insecurities faced by today's generation, amplified by the omnipresence of social media. The film does an excellent job of reflecting these contemporary challenges without losing the timeless nature of youth's quest for identity and connection. The drama and romance in the film are finely tuned to resonate with current societal norms and situations, making it particularly relatable to the younger audience. It captures the essence of how relationships and aspirations are influenced and sometimes complicated by the digital world. In summary, ""Kho Gaye Hum Kahan"" is a well-crafted film that offers a compelling exploration of the journey of self-discovery in the age of social media. It's a narrative that speaks to the heart of the young and the young at heart, making it a recommended watch. The movie, with its excellent cast, thoughtful direction, and relevant storytelling, is a meaningful addition to the genre of modern coming-of-age dramas."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Overhyped and worst acting by Ananya Pandey,"This movie is a waste of time. It is so overhyped with zero elements and subpar acting. The PR team of this movie has been working left, right, and centre to somehow make this movie come across as a hit. I had high expectations from Zoya, but I have been disappointed. The only good part was Adarsh Gourav. The movie plot is weak and Ananya cannot act. Please stop shoving these nepo kids down our throats. Not everyone can be an actor, and it is highly time that these nepo babies understand that they should stop making movies. Instead I would highly suggest watch good movies such as 12th Fail."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Unexpectedly Great Movie,"A really good watch after long time, Dil chahta hai vibe is recreated but speaks on today's world. Must watch, unexpectedly great performance from lead trio. Plot is not that predictable it goes like a crazy ride, which surprises with a great twist. Finally found a movie which can found relatable with today's generation which speaks on current situation. Talking about music it's really hit right at the time, explores indie pop genere smoothly also connects with storyline unknowingly. Can be a best directorial debut as such topics are handled neatly. Spoiler warning movie speaks alot about social media adiction and it's consequences."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Lightheaded,"Kho gaye hum kahan (9/10): Kho gaye hum kahan (9/10):
This is a very lightheaded movie with ananya pandey, siddhant chaturvedi and adarsh gaurav. This movie truly depicts a digital age where things that are being shown on Instagram is more important than the things in reality. And one cannot see inside himself for herself to know better. Ananya Pandey make sure that her ex would not get a good girl again while Adarsh tried to take revenge but he realise it was not himself and that was not I mean Ananya's one was not revenge. While the last one was a comedian and tried to escape from his past."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),I hope this will definitely be included in the better films of the year.,"Siddhant Chaturvedi steals the show in 'Kho Gaye Hum Kahan' with his captivating performance! Ananya Panday's portrayal is equally praiseworthy, adding depth to the storyline. The movie effectively addresses the challenges faced by today's youth, especially the facade of social media and its impact on real-life relationships. The music beautifully complements the narrative, enhancing the overall emotional depth of the film. A commendable movie that brilliantly captures the essence of modern-day struggles. I hope it will be a brilliant movie as per the rating it has got, are you ready for it or not?"
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),A must watch for young adults,"Life captive to screens - very well portrayed. How easily one gets sucked down the virtual life hole, is shown very well. Each character grows on you and I am sure many identify with one of them. Siddhant Chaturvedi is really good. So is Ananya Pandey and Adarsh Gourav. I liked Anya Singh too - she delivered a really important message in essaying her role! Kudos to the writer and director Arjun Varain Singh. There are 4 other writers but I guess Arjun put it all together. The music is nothing to write home about but the movie makes for excellent watching. I recommend that you watch the movie yet reduce screen time. How? Figure that out!"
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN:-an important film on social media culture.,"Kho gaye hum kahan is a comedy drama romantic film directed by arjun varain singh. The film's first half is very happy go lucky. The friendship is fleshed out, the acting is all in place. We are given a peek into the three primary characters' lives, their happiness, their insecurities, their sadness. The writing never overwhelms us with the sadness and morbidity. The characters have aspirations, it gets its fuel from their friendship itself. Nearing the interval, a spat between the two male friends happens which leads to the primary crux of the film, i.e them confronting their fears. Its written very well, but definitely have some convenient plotholes. Ahana yells at neil for exposing an opportunistic, gold digger, when she herself had made a scene at her ex's birthday, who is also a very ugly person. But I like the fact that the film does not try to make its characters politically correct. They are hypocrites in their rights, knowingly or unknowingly. The standup bits of imaad are well written, extracting many chuckles. The film has many dialogues which try to explain to the viewers about the characters' state of mind. That's needless and very demeaning to the adult viewers. Monologues at the end seem to swirl around the film, serving little purpose. The chemistry between imaad and simran is very half baked. The last standup skit where imaad comes out of his trauma is one of the strongest scnes of the film. Siddhant chaturvedi and adarsh gaurav are two highly promising actors. Adarsh gaurav, especially, is the star of this film. Got a very meaty role and clutched onto it. Siddhant has a problem with crying, or maybe his character was a bit emotionally distant. Ananya panday us good, has gotten better over the years but needs to keep hardworking. Her dialogue delivery is still very outlandish. Kalki koechlin is very good, so is rohan gurbaxani. The music is great, the songs are very peppy and fresh. The cinematography is good. The camera mainly traverses closed spaces which conveys the mindspaces of the characters. They are open in the out but their souls are somewhere locked inside them, inside social media."
Kho Gaye Hum Kahan (2023),Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan,"Kho Gaye Hum Kahan directed by debutant director Arjun Varain Singh this movie is produced by Farhan and written by Zoya Akhtar. Basically it is a typical Gen-Z story about how we compare our lives to others through social media . The Zoya's magic of making a triangle in friendships Znmd , Dil chahta hai remains gravitational constant even in this with 3 freinds
[Annaya , Sidhart and Adarsh. Top Notch Chemistry
Top Notch Writting Focusing more on younger demographics and Gen-Z style definately worth watching !!!! One thing , on a personal note Adarsh Gourav A few of the actors who i notice when it comes to noticing and following an actor from Day 1 From Rukh to Hostel Days to White Tiger to Guns and Gulaab to kho gaye hum kahaan What an Actor."
Past Lives (2023),"A Good Old Fashioned ""Women's""Picture...","Only it's not about old fashioned women. It's about new fashioned feminism. How do I know it's a women's flick? First, because the male characters are remarkably fake. Beta and beta-lite, they both would make wonderful friends but fall far short as potential lovers. There's virtually no masculinity in the entire film (not surprising since it was written and directed by a woman). Nora, the lead, is an underwritten character who is the object of adoration because she is so...well, she doesn't have to be anything- she's a woman and therefore the prize. She values her career above all things and that's the way she was brought up- her family uproots itself from what looks like a successful life in Korea to pursue greater success. The conflict here is that because Nora has emigrated to NYC she ends up married to a nebbishy unexciting American guy instead of the far superior looking, if uncharismatic, Korean guy she would have married had her family stayed put. He's not much, but I guess in the Asian world he's a kind of Chad (and he worships her). Ah, the modern women's dilemma: she's so perfect- an educated, thin, beautiful (?), successful playwright forced to settle for an underwhelming partner yearning for Mr. Big (but not enough to mess with her career) In the end, she stays put with the guy who can help her write her plays. Watching Chad East being ubered away she sobs uncontrollably- for herself, of course- who else would she be crying for? She is both hero and victim. I actually enjoyed the film and thought it was well made creating many interesting questions that can be discussed after viewing- but, boy oh boy, is the manosphere going to have a ball with this one."
Past Lives (2023),What if this is our past life?,"Where do I even start?? Such a beautiful film, from the visuals to the storytelling. Watching the film you just can see they wish to be together. But life pulls them a part. The film reminded me a bit of before sunrise, one of my favourite films. It has the same idea of talking getting to know each other, walking and connecting. So if you're a fan of the before trilogy definitely give this a go. The scene of them parting ways when they were children was such an amazing shot, it was like a foreshadow into their future. It showed Nora walking up the steps to her home, Hae Sung walking kind of down the way. This felt like a glimpse to their future, going separate ways, Nora walking upwards showed in a way she would be more successful."
Past Lives (2023),I was expecting more based on the trailer,"I don't know what I was expecting but I for sure thought I would be deeply moved by the story based on what I had seen in the trailer. It was not the case. This is a classic story of a love that couldn't be intertwined with the cultural challenges faced by immigrants. The premise is simple and the storytelling straightforward, a handful of characters, beautiful shots of New York City, questions about fate and self identity, yet it didn't dive deep enough to pull me in. And maybe that's not the aim of the film, maybe it's just there to tell the story at a surface level letting the audience do the work for themselves. I will mention however that the film does a great job at conveying the character's emotions/inner turmoil subtly but with enough clarity to understand how they really feel. Also there are a few beautiful shots (for example the final one). Yes I felt sorry for the 3 main characters who all have to deal with a lot of doubts but the connection between the 2 childhood friends wasn't strong enough to make me cry."
Past Lives (2023),"A metaphore of immigration, identity and belonging","""Past Lives"" beautifully captures the essence of love, destiny, and the immigrant experience. Its poignant narrative, coupled with breathtaking visuals, leaves a lasting impression. What sets this film apart is its nuanced exploration of immigration. The movie transcends the boundaries of the traditional impossible love story, delving metaphorically into the emotional struggles of those who have left their homeland. With a visually stunning backdrop between New York and Seoul, ""Past Lives"" invites the audience to reflect on the complexities of identity, belonging, and the relentless passage of time."
Past Lives (2023),Great concept that you can reflect on,"It's a reality movie away from the romantic movies romance, it sets an example from the difference between our imagination & expectations and the reality of the situation and how we act on it. We all think of the what ifs in our life or what could've been if we've done something differently and the movie here gives us a good example of that, but for me for it to be a better movie i need to understand the characters more, learn about how they feel the way they feel either through scenes or conversations and I think the movie lacked those elements. I felt like I needed to see more of their time together to understand them perfectly, still I appreciate the use of silence as a part of the conversations cause sometimes it's better than words but it was a bit too much in the movie here. Overall it's good movie with a great idea that shows a part of reality that we forget about but in order for it to be better we need to be more involved with the characters' story instead of just hearing about it most of the time."
Past Lives (2023),"A Beautiful Movie, very Deep in meaning.","Under normal circumstances I would not be watching this genera of movies, it is a romance story of two kids that traces their lives through adulthood, and questions the decisions they make in life, and whether if they have made different decisions, they would have been together as adults. I wouldn't say it had a sad ending, but it was neither a happy ending, they ended up exactly where they begun. It is a slow Romance movie, but the beauty of it, is that it gets you thinking of your life and all your friendships and all the what ifs as you age and get older. As a 20 year old I might not have enjoyed this movie so much because I would not have reflected on the meaning of my friendships as I would have reflected today, but as a 55 year old it has a lot of deep meaning which I did enjoy. I do not believe in past lives, but I do believe our souls are eternal or maybe a parallel universe, and I could almost have sworn that at least one of my friendships was meant to be In-Yun as Nora would have put it in the movie. That friendship was never meant to be by my character norms, and defied all of my personal logic, yet it thrived for many years and we are still best of friends, and I often questioned if our souls have crossed a common path before this current life to make this bond so strong. Yes like in the other comments for this movie we make decisions, we choose different doors that lead to different paths, and as a hindsight we would look back and ask ourselves what would have happened if we had opened or took one of the other doors. That said I loved the movie, it was well made. If you love Romance stories then by all means watch it, it is a beautiful movie."
Past Lives (2023),Wake me when the 8.0 rating enters the movie.,"Decided to watch this movie solely on its rating on IMDB and waited almost 2 hours for the 8.0 rating to present itself... I am still waiting. This movie is tough to watch. It's slow with zero excitement. The movie opens with a relatable scene where strangers try guessing the lives of the main characters. This is precisely what you will end up doing to keep yourself awake. The story line is split into random
12 year timeframes where there is no real rationale for the bond that continues between the soulmates separated as kids. Was the Korean gentleman supposed to be a home-wrecker? Was the green-card providing husband supposed to give his wife a hall-pass? Was she going to make out with him before he disappears forever in his Uber? Answer: Who cares? Pick another movie."
Past Lives (2023),A beautiful film in every way. 9.5 stars,"I have never officially rated a film this highly--well, maybe ""The Godfather,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Best Years of Our Lives,"" and a couple of others. But Past Lives exceeded my expectations. Yes, the heavy buzz surrounding the film was an indication that it was probably very good, but, after having watched it, I was still caught off guard. The film is, in a word: beautiful. The cinematography is stunning, the location selections were well thought out, and the acting was sublime. Teo Yoo (as Hae Sung) and John Magaro (as Arthur, the husband) delivered understated yet powerful performances that showed that great acting does not necessitate verbal communication; in this case, non-verbal acting was stronger than any words could express in many of the scenes involving the trio of leading actors. The film kept me watching with rapt attention, and the tension created by the uncertainty of where the relationships were heading added a heavy layer of suspense. The experience was so captivating that I found myself thinking, ""Don't mess up this great film with a terrible ending."" Then came the ending -- or what I THOUGHT was the ending, which made the actual ending ... perfect."
Past Lives (2023),Left me feeling conflicted,"This is very good film, exceptional performances and well structured. 2 childhood friends in Korea are separated when the family of one immigrates to Canada. Years later they reconnect online and grow close again, but they end this when their different location make it difficult to meet. Eventually they do reconnect years later, one is now married and the other travels from Korea to the US and they arrange to meet. It's difficult to watch, as clearly they love each other but their lives took different directions so they were not destined to be together. The main issue I have with the movie is why they would want to meet again. The woman is now married, the man has a girlfriend. Life has moved on for both of them, agreeing to meet like this is never going to end well, someone is going to be hurt. I don't know why either of them couldn't see that, it seemed as though he was the one pining for her. I was also puzzled as to why the woman's American husband was so agreeable for her to be meeting up with her former friend again. Was he not aware of their situation? I came away from the film with these thoughts stuck in my mind. There is truth in the film, relationships are often complicated and we think about what might have been."
Past Lives (2023),This Movie Made Me Angry,"It started out pretty good: scenes from the lives of the two characters in their youth as friends with puppy love. Then we learn that the girl will be leaving the country. The first thing her mother does is set up a date with the boy and his mother as a chaperone. Then proceeds to tell the other mother that they are moving away and wanted this date as a pleasant memory for her daughter, not taking into consideration what that might do to the boy's emotions. Then we fast forward to them at university age and they skype a lot. She quickly halts this as it's too much for her. Even though she has feelings for him, she cuts him out of her life and decides to match herself with a man - who she has control over. She seduces him, he trys to learn her language and hangs out with her family. There is never talk of his family. The way he lays across her in bed as a woman does to a man. The way he is afraid she doesn't love him. She has the power; even if her husband never speaks of his fears, they exist and she can feel that on some level. She even says to his face that her old friend is very masculine and typical / normal. A normal man, the very thing that is too much for her. She needs to be on top, so to speak. People comment on the noble character of the husband, but think it was the only thing he could do. To just take it, and prey that she would stay. I was angry as this film triggered my own experiences with an emotionally bankrupt woman. The way she would just stare at her Korean visitor during their time together in NYC, showed how she wanted to be near the tiger, but does not dare try to tame it."
No Hard Feelings (2023),Don't listen to the bad reviews!,"Jennifer Lawrence was awesome! Our theater were laughing their a$$es off. She is so good at being funny! She needs to do more comedy. Love the raunchiness. If you don't like raunchy, then you shouldn't see it. She doesn't try so hard to be funny unlike some bad Gen Z movies (looking at you ""Anything but You"". I think this movie deserves more attention it got. How can anybody not like JLaw. She shines even on bad movie which this isn't one. I laughed hard on this film. Not small chuckles. I hope people see it more once it is on streaming. Omg, I don't understand the bad reviews. Maybe people think it's cool to hate her. I don't get it!"
No Hard Feelings (2023),Unfortunate Jennifer Lawrence career choice,"Jennifer Lawrence is a fine actress, as shown in Silver Lining Playbook (2012) and American Hustle (2013). She's broadening her range with a ranch-com, but No Hard Feelings (2023) is so poorly written, it is beneath her talents. The problem is writer/director Gene Stupnitsky. He likes ranch-coms, but doesn't make them very well, as shown by Good Boys (2019) and Bad Teacher (2011). Now in No Hard Feelings (2023), a plausible premise leads from one painfully unrealistic situation to another, cringeworthy characters unable to function socially. A raunch-com is not Oscar-worthy drama, but it can still portray realistic characters and a sensible story arc. No Hard Feelings (2023) is in many respects a rip-off of The Big Bang Theory (2007-2019), but the latter portrays nerd culture much more deftly, showing sympathy both for the nerds and for more socially adept people who live with them. No Hard Feelings (2023) had an opportunity to portray micromanaged, overly-protected Gen Zers and their difficulties leaving the nest. Instead it portrays a dweeb born with a silver spoon who squanders opportunities. The characters are reduced to tokens in contrived situations. Kaley Cuoco found a rich character to portray in The Big Bang Theory (2007-2019). Unfortunately, No Hard Feelings (2023) is not a similar opportunity for Jennifer Lawrence."
No Hard Feelings (2023),Movie is way underrated. Very cute and well worth watching,"Jennifer Lawrence is great as the female lead. Her acting talent is really on display. She makes the movie believable. Based on what happens to hot destinations: Raise the property taxes so the people living there can't afford to live there and have to sell to the rich people moving in. Mathew Broderick is great as the boys father. Very understated performance. He and the woman playing his wife do a great job as helicopter parents. A lot of very funny scenes showing the generation gap between someone 30+ and kids 18 or 19. Excellent dialog, good pace, and a cute script. For entertainment value at least an 8."
No Hard Feelings (2023),Wonderfull,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film. As a film it has a fairly banal plot but developed in such a way as to be very funny and above all very sweet. I recognize that this film is not a masterpiece but we must recognize its value as a romantic comedy where friendship reigns supreme and where the moral, even if classic, is developed in a very beautiful way. So it must be said that this film is a beautiful comedy developed in such a sweet way that it is truly capable of captivating the viewer at any moment, managing to never let the viewer detach from the screen."
No Hard Feelings (2023),"Finally! A funny comedy, it's been, like YEARS!","I'd heard about the nudity in No Hard Feelings before I heard about the actual movie, so I wasn't necessarily expecting a laugh out loud comedy as I assumed the nudity was the actual selling feature. I was wrong. In this day & age, sex & nudity isn't hard to access but good comedy is definitely rare. I'm definitely at the age (57) where I really just want to be entertained and laugh. After I saw the trailer, my expectations grew; Jennifer Lawrence IS naturally funny and quick witted in real life (from the interviews I've seen) and she definitely has developed strong comedy chops. Needless to say they are on full display in No Hard Feelings and I'd hope to see her do more films like this. Lawrence paired with Aubrey Plaza, Melissa McCarthy, Kristin Wiig, Tina Fey etc would be dynamite, as long as Fey & co wrote the script. The farfetched premise, rich helicopter parents want to hire a girl to turn their shy, nerdy introverted son into a ""man"" so he can gain some confidence before college, is as outlandish & somewhat predictable as it is thin, but this isn't a documentary so just go with it. At this stage of her career, Lawrence certainly doesn't have to do nudity but she does it on her terms and it's classic. Not going to spoil it. Andrew Barth Feldman who plays the hapless & love lost Percy is the perfect stooge against Lawrence's cougar-esque Maddie. Percy's dad, Laird, played by Matthew Broderick, & Laura Benanti as Allison, Percy's mom, are a tad one dimensional but they're there to provide the premise with the macguffin being a used Buick, but it works. Former SNL's Kyle Mooney's cameo provides a lot of chuckles and he certainly left me wanting more. The comedy heavily relies on Lawrence trying to be sexy but coming off way too strong. That's not to say Lawrence isn't sexy, of course she is, but it's how that level of female sexual aggressiveness just doesn't land with the Minecraft & Fortnite generation, no matter how many Rule 34 videos they've watched based on their favourite animated shows. They're woefully under prepared for that level of hotness...and therefore hilarity ensues. And it actually does! The plot attempts to give the characters more emotional depth by revealing their backstory's which succeeds to a degree. It's not entirely heavy-handed thank goodness which could have thrown the balance if the movie off. There's laughs and heart to bring the story to its completion and I'm not going to lie, I felt a post-credit scene set in the future would have been nice. All in all, a nice surprise and from what I can remember one of the best comedy's in recent memory. Come for the nudity, stay for the laughs!"
No Hard Feelings (2023),Potentially could be better,"I found this movie ok. Typically I watch Action, Thrillers, that type of stuff but don't mind a rom-com once in a while. However, from the rom-coms I've seen, this comes in at the bottom tier. The storyline did have a potential of coming out better than it did but the casting other than JLaw was atrocious. JLaw did play a semi-decent role in this movie. The movie seemed rushed at times and some of the scenes seemed very dull. I feel like there wasn't a good enough steady tone throughout the movie and just felt bland at times. In my opinion, the attempt of a raunchy comedy with a heartfelt story just did not work out here."
No Hard Feelings (2023),"""I'm Not Touching You"" A 'No Hard Feelings' Review","We all remember the obnoxious little thing we did with our siblings and friends as kids. The thing that happened just as some game ended with someone being upset about something- just before a parent got called. The victim of childish misdeeds would ask to not be touched but in an attempt to save face and rebel against being reprimanded by a peer, the offender would hover their hand just near enough to be annoying and say, ""I'm not touching you."" Gene Stupnitsky and John Phillip's ""No Hard Feelings"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman play this game of ""I'm not touching you"" with sexual impropriety. I dare not use the p-word, lest this becomes an allegation. Nevertheless, despite the chance to see our forever Katniss Everdeen in her most hilarious role since ""Don't Look Up"" we were made to grimace at all the scenes where our writers and director bring us to the brink of what, in our real world, would be a sexual misconduct case, and then says, ""I'm not touching you,"" in that same mischief-ridden way we did as kids before we knew better. As I watched, I fought the temptation to find something on my phone to focus on. I began to obsess about how old the actor who portrayed Percy was in real life because maybe he was a young-in-the-face 30-year-old, and maybe that would make me feel less complicit in the normalization of inappropriate relationships for sporadically laughing. I fought the idea of being that person who couldn't just see something and let it be what it is without turning it into something it wasn- and that's when I realized it. It wasn't me turning it into something it wasn't. It already was that something. In recent years, men in the industry have caught hell (rightfully so) with the Me Too Movement, where their misdeeds caught up to them in staggering numbers of people speaking out about the discomfort and straight-up pain they've been made to feel in their work environments. The one true error in the movement was all of the women who weren't called to the carpet for their crimes because young men are socialized to wear attention from older women as a badge pinned to the sash of their manhood. What I expected from this film was a fresh take on 2006's showdown between Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey in Failure to Launch. What I got was; ""let's forcefully deflower an awkward, traumatized teenager. But let's make it be because his parents are asking,"" so that I'm not touching you. ""And then after she fails to sexually assault him properly, he'll start to like her, then it will be consensual,"" so still, I'm not touching you. ""and then let's make sure they never actually do it because that would actually be improper and probably get us canceled"" I'm definitely not touching you. ""But it's cool if they get naked in his childhood bed with his parents in the other room, then he'll actually attempt to do the deed but it won't count because, in his inexperience, he didn't realize it was just her thigh"" haha I'm not touching you! Let's do the thing where we reverse the roles. Had it been a 30+-year-old man and a 19- year-old high school girl, phones would be ringing, think pieces would be written, and everyone behind the project would be proverbially chased by an angry mob. The thing is if I told you the story of 32-year-old Maddie Barker and 19-year-old Percy Becker without the lights, cameras, and the Oscar-winning actress, you'd cringe. Love to the comedic stylings of Jennifer Lawrence but, why does the big screen loosen our scruples?"
No Hard Feelings (2023),Surprisingly good.,"I don't enjoy Rom-Coms. Generally. I neither enjoy overused tropes, cheap laughs, chlichés and generic, forgettable crowd-pleasers. Therefore, I went in with little expectation. Even though the trailer was rather ok. The difference in all of this is made by a single factor:
Jennifer Lawrence's charisma. It's so apparent that she's also producing this movie. And seemed to have a lot of fun doing so. Minus points for the male lead (around the transition of 2nd to 3rd act), not quite fitting score sometimes and the very very clichéd structure. Apart from that, comedic excellence. I didn't laugh tears. But from the beginning to end, it just made me feel good. The side characters are impeccable. The humour is fresh and neat. But Jennifer Lawrence shines above it all. Bravo to her. Let's hope for more producing/acting credits in the future. I am yet to see her miss a shot."
No Hard Feelings (2023),Maybe I'm just a romantic,"I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard but also felt so moved by a comedy. I felt like I was right there in Mauntak with Maddie and Percy. Perhaps it's my own encounters with intrusive parents and ex partners that lend a personal touch, making my affection for this film particularly profound. Is it just like a universal experience to naively fall for someone notably older in your hometown before college? Can we make a support group chat? Anyways...Andrew Barth Feldman's character struck a chord with me; his awkward moments were consistently endearing. The film's execution was great, leaving me contemplating a second viewing despite the fact I don't enjoy re-watching movies."
No Hard Feelings (2023),"Just getting a beer, Frosted","No Hard Feelings is a raunchy rom-com featuring Jennifer Lawrence as Maddie and Andrew Barth Feldman as Percy. The movie is based upon an actual craigslist ad and was turned into a movie. Truly this is the first comedy I have seen in years that made me laugh out loud. I believe it is a nice throwback to yesteryear in regards to classic 80's 90's and early 00's movies. There's a core formula to these types of movies that always makes them work and I just can't seem to ever get tired of. Summary
Maddie is overdue on property taxes and is going to lose the house her mom left her. Her car gets towed and has to think of something. Eventually she comes upon an ad placed by helicopter parents wanting their son to gain ""experience"" before college."
The Sound of Music (1965),Unique!,"Unique in that Marni Nixon is credited! She plays Sister Sophia, credited as herself, no less. No need to dub Julie Andrews, who apparently could sing! Who knew! 60 years later and my 5 year old granddaughter already sings along. Definitely the loudest if not the most dulcet tones to be sure. Kind of the definition of a classic. I doubt her grandchildren will be singing along with Hamilton. This and other Roger's and Hammerstein classics define what it means to be a classic musical. While easy to to dismiss as fluff, it is based on a true story set in 1938 on the eve of the Nazis taking over Austria, and has Nazis, betrayal, escapes, life and death situations, hiding behind it's musical scrim. The music and lyrics range from filler to carry the story along, to songs that became American Standards. ""Edelweiss"" is so well written many assume it is the actual national anthem of Austria. There are several story lines, both young children and their parents can watch the movie and leave the theatre having experienced completely different movies. Several scenes could be stressful for young children, in stark contrast to the movies general lighthearted theme. Each time I watch, a hidden gem reveals itself, worth a 30th or 40th viewing for sure. Note the stage musical and the movie version are not the same, the movie version reorders the original, and eliminates a couple of songs. Though not as extreme as the stage and movie versions of ""Chicago"" for example. That said I find Robert Wises version to be the superior production. Enjoy!"
The Sound of Music (1965),This is how you do it!,"Quite simply the best, most heart warming musical out ther, (Westside story) a close second, talent, perfect cast, beautiful scenery, perfect choreography, uplifting, absolutely the best film I have ever seen. Julie Andrew's is sublime, her voice is so pure, no need for razzmatazz
, clever film effects, ai inspired score, just real unadulterated talent. Take note all newcomers, write fantastic music, gather a perfect cast, focus on the quality of the story and let magic happen. Julie Andrew's, Marnie Nixon are the voices of happiness, no auto tune, no adjustments required. If you have not seen this film, you have missed a classic."
The Sound of Music (1965),Too White!!!!,"The movie ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the uplifting musicals that Hollywood created in the 60s. Similar to ""Hello Dolly"" and ""Mary Poppins"", these films did not mirror the political and social upheavals of the era, but rather served as a retreat from reality into the realm of fiction. The musical ""West Side Story"" stands out as an exception, being the first to portray the Latino community in New York and delve into their political issues. ""The Sound of Music"" has been subject to criticism for its portrayal of politics. The film's protagonist, Captain von Trapp, resists Nazism, but his opposition is not rooted in its antisemitism, militarism, or authoritarianism. Rather, his primary concern is the threat Nazi Germany poses to Austrian sovereignty. Furthermore, the film has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity."
The Sound of Music (1965),good,"Actually, there is no need for a long comment at all. From the first second, which has a magnificent entrance to the film, it is a film that has passed into the history of cinema, filled with joy, sometimes sadness, but usually happiness. Andrews, who won acclaim with Mary Poppins, forms a harmonious duo with Plummer, while each of the von Trapp children, who are at the center of the film, are very cute. We see that the magnificent beauty of Salzburg is also crowned as a different character throughout the film. Quality songs that have been expressed musically also attract attention. It never bores a person to listen to it many times. Predictable entry-development-results do not bother at all. In fact, the film shifts to a lot of politics in the last quarter. Let's also remind that it is inspired by real events and characters that have happened. So the von Trapp family is completely real. After watching the movie, those who are curious can do some research. It can be recommended unconditionally to everyone young and old, one of the rare films that can win everyone's liking."
The Sound of Music (1965),Cinema at its best,"When it comes to timeless classics, few films have left as indelible a mark on the world of cinema as ""The Sound of Music."" Released in 1965, this musical masterpiece directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer has enchanted generations with its captivating story, memorable songs, and stunning Austrian landscapes. However, even the most beloved classics can be subject to scrutiny, and in this review, we will explore the notion that ""The Sound of Music"" could potentially be better, examining its strengths, weaknesses, and the possibilities for revitalizing this cherished cinematic gem. Set against the backdrop of the beautiful Austrian Alps, ""The Sound of Music"" tells the heartwarming tale of Maria (Julie Andrews), a spirited young nun who is sent to be the governess for the seven von Trapp children, widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s offspring. The film is a captivating blend of romance, music, and drama, as Maria's free-spirited nature clashes with the Captain's stern demeanor, while they both grapple with their growing affection for one another amidst the looming threat of the Nazi regime. One of the film's undoubted strengths is its memorable music, composed by Richard Rodgers with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. From the iconic opening number, ""The Sound of Music,"" to the touching ""Edelweiss"" and the lively ""Do-Re-Mi,"" the soundtrack is a symphony of melodies that have become a part of our cultural fabric. Julie Andrews' soaring soprano voice and the children's harmonious choruses create moments of sheer auditory bliss that are hard to rival. The musical numbers elevate the film and provide it with a timeless quality that continues to draw audiences to this day. The cast of ""The Sound of Music"" is another asset that has stood the test of time. Julie Andrews is luminous as Maria, exuding warmth and charisma, while Christopher Plummer brings depth and vulnerability to the stoic Captain von Trapp. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their love story remains one of cinema's most enduring romances. The von Trapp children, played by a talented ensemble of young actors, add charm and innocence to the narrative, making their journey from discipline to joy all the more endearing. The film's breathtaking cinematography also deserves acclaim. Robert Wise and his team expertly capture the stunning Austrian landscapes, with sweeping shots of lush green hills, crystal-clear lakes, and majestic mountains. The visuals serve as a visual symphony that complements the musical one, immersing the audience in the story's picturesque world. The contrast between the natural beauty of the surroundings and the encroaching threat of Nazi occupation heightens the film's tension and emotional impact. However, despite its many strengths, ""The Sound of Music"" is not without its flaws, and it is these areas that warrant a critical reevaluation. First and foremost, the film's pacing can be a bit uneven. While the musical numbers are undoubtedly the film's highlights, the transitions between these musical sequences and the dramatic moments can feel abrupt and disjointed. The film's nearly three-hour runtime occasionally drags, and some scenes could benefit from tighter editing to maintain a more consistent flow. Another aspect that merits reconsideration is the treatment of certain characters. The portrayal of the von Trapp family's housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and the nuns at the abbey where Maria resides can be seen as somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. These characters, while important to the story, are not given the same depth and development as the main characters, leaving them feeling like caricatures rather than fully realized individuals. Furthermore, the film's depiction of the Nazi threat, while undoubtedly a central element of the story, may come across as somewhat sanitized to modern audiences. Given the gravity of the historical context, ""The Sound of Music"" could have delved deeper into the political and moral complexities of the era. While the film does not shy away from the looming danger, a more nuanced exploration of the characters' choices and dilemmas in the face of Nazism could have added depth to the narrative. In addition, some viewers may find fault with the film's idealized portrayal of the von Trapp family's escape from the Nazis. The daring flight over the mountains is undoubtedly a gripping climax, but it also carries a sense of adventure that borders on the fantastical. A more realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by those fleeing the Nazi regime could have made the story even more impactful. So, how could ""The Sound of Music"" be improved? One approach could involve reimagining the film as a limited series, allowing for a more expansive exploration of its characters and historical context. This format would provide the opportunity to delve deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of characters like Captain von Trapp and Maria, as well as to address the broader political landscape of Austria in the late 1930s. A longer format would also allow for a more gradual development of the romance between Maria and the Captain, giving their relationship a more authentic and nuanced feel. It could also provide the space to explore the emotional impact of their choices on the von Trapp children and the other characters in the story. In terms of pacing, a series format would alleviate the need to compress the narrative into a three-hour film, allowing for a more natural progression of the story and character arcs. It would also provide an opportunity to delve into the lives and experiences of characters like Frau Schmidt and the nuns, giving them the depth and dimension they deserve. In conclusion, ""The Sound of Music"" is undeniably a cinematic classic that has earned its place in the hearts of audiences worldwide. Its timeless music, enchanting performances, and stunning visuals continue to captivate new generations. However, a critical reevaluation reveals areas where the film could be improved, particularly in terms of pacing, character development, and historical context. One possible approach to revitalizing this beloved classic is to reimagine it as a limited series, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of its characters and historical backdrop. While ""The Sound of Music"" may never be perfect in the eyes of every viewer, it remains a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the magic of cinema."
The Sound of Music (1965),Sound of Music,"Straight away it looks great, It has that the bigger the screen the better it will look feel to it. To begin with I found singing Nuns slightly nauseating. Then Julie Andrews starts to look after the Von Trapp family and she basically brainwashes them with singing and somehow brainwashes you. As well as excellent location filming, every shot is perfectly placed. The choreography is also spectacular. Also a great placed Intermission Card (Something that should should be in movies over 150 minutes now) Then it ends with a great mid 60's style escape from the Nazis. I think anyone who tells you they don't like this has not actually watched it from start to finish and are just judging it on the clips."
The Sound of Music (1965),10/10,"I know this movie is long, but it's an endless musical nonetheless. What I liked best were the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs. They are amazing, and make the movie what it is. Another reason I like it is Julie Andrews' amazing performance as Maria, a girl who longs for a better life, I think. Maria is beautiful, has a beautiful voice, mixed with nervousness and sadness, all qualities that Andrews brings to her performances. The only film she slightly disappointed was Thoroughly Modern Millie. The choreography is superb, as is the supporting cast, from the likes of Christopher Plummer and co. I can't pick a favorite scene, but who can forget the opening and the ""Do ah Dear"" sequence? I also thought the kids were sweet and the movie had some clever subplots, like Liesels secret love. 10/10 for a musical, which should be in the top 250. It's number 2 on Greatest Musicals, beating out Grease."
The Sound of Music (1965),Sugar-coated Lie!,"I used to think this movie was enjoyable. Then when I learned about the true story and what the Von Trapp family life was really like, I eventually became devastated. The fact that Maria didn't really love Captain Von Trapp really doesn't sound like her marriage life was any good. Why would it? And the fact that the movie depicts that she was truly in love with him and just in denial about it at first, really is one of the worst lies ever. There's always been so much confusion on dating and marriage, and this is one issue, which I feel, many people don't seem to understand is actually very bad. This deception is very unacceptable!"
The Sound of Music (1965),A Once In A Lifetime Movie,"Superb,superb,superb,Damn I was smiling and bobbing my head all the way and lost all sense of time and place,this has to be one of the greatest movies of all time
A little fact,when they filming the silhouette scene during the ending of the film,the director had to go for the silhouette because Julia Andrews was laughing as the room was making ""a raspberry sound""
The subtle expressions and nuanced micro acting of Julia Andrews especially when the baroness was telling her about love and all was perfect,the traditional dancing scene outside with Christopher Vonn trapp,you can see when he turned his back,his expression is that of uncertainty and when she takes his hand,he cracks a smile. The music was catchy and the entire movie was nostalgic and had excellent vibes even for a 58 year old movie
Another fact,most tourists who visit Austria,a majority of them say that this movie inspired them to visit Salzburg
Another fact,during the opening scenes in the mountains,the helicopter filming actually did a drawback wash making Julia Andrews to fall but because the film had already been shot,there was no need for a retake. Never did the studios or the directors think that they will ever be a sensation and we're only preoccupied with getting back their budget for the film,but they grossed more than 33 times the amount they spent in the film. This goes in the list of movies you should watch in your lifetime. I,among thousands,watches this film once in a while and it never gets boring. What a film."
The Sound of Music (1965),MY COMFORT MOVIE,"The Sound of Music is really really my comfort movie. A place where I can run to whenever I need some peace of mind. The music, songs, the peaceful scenery of the mountains, dancing, laughing, running around freely, kids. There could never be a movie this goated again. Truly. And not just that, but also meaningful message in it. About kindness, compassion, hope, second chances. One day I really want to visit all the places there is in the movie. Especially the mountain and the abby where Maria sang and the mountain where Von Trapp family walking through. ONCE AGAIN, THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!"
Priscilla (2023),Is breathtaking,"What a well crafted movie. Coppola is perhaps the best female director (out there with Varda) and she was able to portray the relationship dynamic between Elvis and Priscilla in a masterful way both in the script as well as in the directing. The film tells the story that many of us wanted to see and hear for many years and Coppola nailed it. The acting is superb both by Spaeny and Elordi who manage to give life to the characters and make them their own. To me, the only negative aspect is the fact that no actual Elvis records were used and I think they should have fought harder to get them. F."

Priscilla (2023),The team did a great job taking us back to the 1960s and 1970s. Even the smallest detail was included such as the makeup brands that Priscilla used.,"IN A NUTSHELL:
The film is based on the book ""Elvis and Me"" by Priscilla Presley, who also worked as the Executive Producer. It features a teenage Priscilla when she met and fell in love with Elvis. The movie was directed by Sofia Coppola. She also wrote it along with Priscilla Presley and Sandra Harmon. What's interesting is that the Elvis Presley Enterprises declined to approve of the movie and didn't give permission to Sofia Coppola to use any of Elvis' famous songs. Lisa Marie Presley hated the movie and didn't give her approval of it either. She said it made her father look like a manipulative predator. She was going to speak out against it at the movie's release but, sadly, she recently passed away. The movie has already won ""Best Film"" at the Venice Film Festival. THINGS I LIKED:
Cailee Spaeny does an excellent job playing a young, timid Priscilla who is treated as a possession by Elvis. He keeps her primped just like the little poodle in a cage that is gifted to Priscilla. We see her transform from an almost voiceless girl to a woman who finally learns to stand up for herself. It's amazing how much infidelity she tolerated for so long. Jacob Elordi sounds so much like Elvis Presley! I hadn't seen him or Cailee Spaeny in anything before and thought they both did a great job. Elvis was 10 years older than Priscilla. She was only 5'4"" tall, making her 8 inches shorter than Elvis. They were only married for 6 years. Priscilla never remarried. In an interview, she stated that ""No one could ever match him.""
I appreciated the female perspective of a woman director. It was clever how the crew remade so many album covers, magazine covers, and other material with the face of the new actor playing Elvis. The team did a great job taking us back to the 1960s and 1970s. Even the smallest detail was included such as the makeup brands that Priscilla used. The hair, makeup, and costume teams did a fantastic job. Some of the frames are absolutely gorgeous to look at. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's too bad that they weren't able to use Elvis' actual songs in the film. Instead, they used music from Sofia Coppola's husband's band ""Phoenix"". What kind of a man tells his pregnant wife to leave? Elvis is portrayed as a completely spoiled narcissist. The ending is kind of strange. Priscilla leaves alone...without her daughter? They shared custody after the divorce but the movie made it look like she abandoned their young daughter. Lisa Marie was only 9 years old when Elvis died at the young age of 42. Of course, Elvis isn't alive to defend this portrayal of him, yet we do know that he had many affairs and admitted that he wasn't prepared to be a father and raise a daughter. Some have complained that the film is just a money grab after the success of last year's movie about Elvis Presley. The timing is curious, of course, but more interesting is to see a film from the perspective of the other person in the tumultuous marriage. TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids will be very bored. So will some adults. Firearms are shown and used. Some profanity, including 1 F-bomb. Drugs are consumed in many scenes. To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!"
Priscilla (2023),The sad reality of having the world at your feet at a young age,"Priscilla is the new Sophia Coppola directed film based on the book Elvis and Me penned by Priscilla Beaulie Presley and Sandra Harmon in 1985. The film is a slow burn that focuses on Priscilla and Elvis's relationship from their first meeting till their eventual divorce. As an Elvis fan one of the big criticisms I've seen of this film is that some people feel it's slanderous towards the Elvis name. I didn't however feel this way, as an Elvis fan I think it's pretty clear that the man was no angel, he had demons and these reared their head more and more as his physical health started to decline. We will never know exactly how much of any of the things you read or watch about Elvis's life actually happened as due to how popular the man was there was so much written about him and a lot of it contradicts each other. Where this film is at it's most unique is that it moves away from focusing on Elvis's career and puts the camera solely on his relationship with Pricilla. Elvis is portrayed by Jacob Elordi who was one of the main stand outs in Saltburn. I've seen a lot of criticism of his performance as Elvis and whilst he doesn't look as much like Elvis as Austin Butler did I think he got the voice down to a tee. Elvis is portrayed here as someone who exercises an immense amount of control over everything in his life. I can certainly understand how a young boy who in a very short period of time went from poverty to becoming the biggest musician on the planet would be in the mindset that the world revolves around him. This in turn has a massive impact on his relationship with Priscilla. When they first met I believe she was 14 years old and the film and Cailee Spaeny's performance do a great job of showing that innocence and showing how that innocence gets corrupted when she falls in love with this huge megastar and suddenly must grow up very quickly. She's thrown into a world that she doesn't fully understand and pays the price when things aren't going well in Elvis's life. Whilst this film is set 60 years ago at a time where gender rolls were adhered too much more strictly some of the physical violence she had to endure is unforgivable. It is however a sad story all around, a story where no one really wins. Priscilla has to leave a relationship with someone she really loves and her daughter ends up growing up having spent very little time with her father which is made even sadder following Lisa Marie Presley's passing in January of last year. You also have to think that if Elvis had also taken more time away from his career to focus on sorting out the problems in his private life that he may still be with us today. Some real food for thought."
Priscilla (2023),An average movie,"One cannot help comparing this movie with
"" Elvis"" of 2022 which was on the same subject and which was far superior in all aspects. This one is about the gaps in the marital relationship between Elvis and Priscilla and not just about Priscilla alone. It could have been called "" Elvis and Priscilla "" instead. First the negative aspects. Nothing in the movie looks or sound real not the love or emotions or feelings. The narrative is too laid back, the dialogues are uninspiring and nothing dramatic or interesting really happens most of the time. The casting of Jacob Elordi as Elvis doesn't appear to be the best one. For one he is too tall and awkward in his dialogue delivery. For a singer, it is intriguing that he mumbles his way through most of the time. I wonder why he was directed to perform that way. The other characters are also on a low profile too. There is mention colonel at times. It is difficult to imagine an Elvis movie without his songs and this movie is exactly that.( I understand there were issues relating to permission to use.) What is actually the saving grace is the fairly good direction by Sofia Cuppola and the appealing acting of Cailee Spaeny in the title role. Both ladies have contributed to lift the movie a bit."
Priscilla (2023),A misromance and the influence of Elvis,"Sofia Coppola's 'Priscilla' is an artistic, dark romance showing how much power a man can have over a woman and how it can determine the rest of their life. Before going into this film, I believed this to be the story of Priscilla, not so many mentions of Elvis and the majority of the focus being on his wife. I was wrong as I underestimated how much Elvis was a part of Priscilla's life even from the young age of 14. This film goes over the life of Priscilla from the age of 14 where she is invited over to Elvis' house where Elvis immediately takes interest in her. From there, they grow as a couple despite the age gap, the rise of Elvis and Priscilla. Only for the eventually lead to the fall in their relationship. A film about the unknowingness of anyone at a young age, how much power a man can have over a woman if played right, the influence one can have over the other's life. Priscilla's life was Elvis and that speaks for itself. Sofia Coppola did an amazing job with this film when it comes to the post-script production, from the romanticized visuals, to the artificial look of all things making the sets look like a doll house, all go over the person Elvis wanted Priscilla to be even from the very beginning and also what Coppola wanted this film to be... even from the very beginning. But apart from the visuals and sets, Coppola's work with the actors and camera is very smart especially when it comes to the scenes with Elvis and Priscilla as Coppola captures more of what Priscilla is feeling and puts majority of the focus on her to see what her point of view must've looked like. The screenplay lacks. It is very constant throughout the film as not a lot happens other than the casual bipolarity of Elvis representing a break down in their relationship. The movie would've been better if they captured some other features of Priscilla's life like her karate-era or whatever was happening with her karate teacher. But instead the film was made to be very constant as for the sequences and story development. The character development is there though, but it's not hard to achieve the development of Priscilla from who she was at 14 to the grown woman she was with Elvis. The visuals of this film are probably my favorite part as for the doll-house-like sets, the romanticized look on Elvis' and Priscilla's relationship at first, the framing especially with the change in Priscilla as a character, and more. All make the film so much more of what it is and add a lot to the table when it comes to speaking about the film. What these visual do is give the film the at first build up it needs to show the high point in life for Priscilla only to dramatize the fall, which is just one of the things the visuals do. Another being giving the film that certain vibe which many films need and fail to achieve, but for Priscilla it's like it is its own genre. Priscilla definitely deserves a watch and a re-watch as it is that good. Only problem is the screenplay and how boring it was made to be, but the amazing visuals make up for it."
Priscilla (2023),fails to tell what she felt,"She is just a teenager, when Elvis entered her life - as young as she was, she must have had hopes, fears and dreams. We learn nothing of those or what else is going on inside of her. She remains the empty piece of paper, the unwritten human being, the entire world assumed she must have been... Unforgivable from a woman's perspective. As other mentioned: the height-difference is off-putting since it's pushing the narrative towards an even bigger difference of power as it might have been in reality, almost scratching the topic of abuse. I'm sure the real Priscilla had dreams and ambitions and was not the flat and willingless object as she's portraited here."
Priscilla (2023),"Repeated events, weak Elvis portraying, and great directing","Rating: 7/10
Format: iPad @ home An adapted screenplay that is beautifully directed by the right director. The film really portrays Priscilla's own point of view from the beginning of meeting Elvis to the collapse of the relationship. However, it is 1h 52m of repeated events. I'm gonna admit it, I'm NOT FULLY convinced of Jacob Elordi as a talented actor. Most of the characters he plays in most of his films and shows are mostly cute and good looking big guys, nothing different each time. Euphoria (2019 - 2025), The Kissing Booth trilogy, and Saltburn (2023). However, his portraying of Elvis in this film is somewhat 'surprisingly' convincing to me. I would say about 60% convincing. But, I felt like having another actor would perhaps made it better for me especially towards the last 52 minutes of the film that is an absolute chaos in my opinion. Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla proved herself as a talented you g actress that must be given more roles and will definitely steal the show like she did in this film. She gave us that jealous, young girl who is in love with the most famous Rock and Roll singer in history. The film unfortunately takes a turn and loses its balance after the firs hour. It feels rushed and the build on that was happening in the first hour was finished terribly. Fast paced dialogues and events that resulted in actors getting out the worst of them due to the weak script and dialogues. I don't have much comments on Sofia Coppola's directing as it was as great as expected. Great representation of the different timelines that we jump to throughout the whole film from production and custom designs and the music score too. At most times we hear romantic songs from the 1960s and 1970s. But, when Priscilla goes through major changes in her relationship with Elvis, the music score shifts to being a modern music score (as if it's very similar to a snythwave) that gives that feeling of being trap and that this relationship will end terribly."
Priscilla (2023),"Emotionally Distant, For Better and Worse",Priscilla is an interesting examination of fame and how it takes a toll on stars and their spouses but it falls short in one key area. Because for almost the entire film Sofia Coppola keeps Elvis as a character at a distance. Sometimes this works in the ways it portrays the growing wedge between him and Priscilla but as an audience member it made the character feel lacking for me. The central relationship starts extremely quickly and I never quite felt that the connection Elvis feels with Priscilla was earned. As a result I never really felt like the film got of the real heart of the relationship and I found the portrayal of Elvis to be widely inconsistent and I couldn't quite pin down what Coppola was trying to say about him. Granted I don't know much about Elvis as a person but I don't feel like I should have to do research to better understand a films depiction of a real life figure. I think Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi are great and even if the gradual tension building between them feels like it's missing key scenes they act it out perfectly. I wouldn't say this movie didn't do Priscilla Presley justice but the results did leave me wanting quite a bit. Not a misfire by any means but a film that absolutely falls short of its potential for me.
Priscilla (2023),Worst movie of all time?,"This movie has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life for many reasons. I was somewhat looking forward to it because I am so obsessed with Elvis 2022 probably the biggest fan of it. So I wanted to see this movie to hear Priscilla's side of the story but I was beyond disappointed and honestly offended. First of all, Jacob Elordi as Elvis is a terrible choice. He was nothing like Elvis at all and made me wonder why he was even considered to play the role. At least make the actor the same height as the person you're trying to portray? I just need to say I hate the made up scenarios. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes for 2 hours. There were some scenes that made me angry they would even include that because it's not even remotely true. Another sad thing is that this movie took awesome moments we saw in Elvis but made them disgusting and hard to watch. For example, the scene where in Las Vegas Elvis acts sexually aggressive toward her made me feel sick. In Elvis they included that day but it was an amazing, sensational scene where everyone was hype and stuff. Pathetic that they chose to make a depressing movie replacing greatness with disturbing scenes no one wants to see. They clearly made this B rated looking movie in 5 minutes to appease some kind of audience that would rather watch a sickening and boring version of Elvis and Priscilla's story than one depicting greatness, emotion, and legacy. It is satisfying to see this movie flop."
Asteroid City (2023),Eccentric But Hollow; Wes Anderson Decline Continues,"Something's happened to Wes Anderson. Somewhere past The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, he slid into a deep, self-indulgent rut that's made his subsequent films feel like a chore. Excluding the lively Grand Budapest Hotel, a fleeting glimmer of hope, each new entry in his catalog has grown more tediously derivative than the last, a gradual recline into the echo chamber that's amplified each of his best and worst traits. Asteroid City is just the latest disappointing, star-studded example of that trend. Make no mistake, the picture looks great. Stuffed with gaudy film techniques, quaint details, incredible color palettes and gorgeous compositions, it makes for a wonderful trailer. Enough to make us think, hey, maybe this time Anderson has finally bucked the monkey and returned to making the kind of quirky, strong-hearted epics that first made us fall in love with him! Not hardly. Three minutes of immediate, nonsensical act-within-a-screenplay-within-a-movie layering was enough to relieve me of that illusion. The rush of ensuing long, dry, same-voiced monologues only reinforced my belief that this auteur has lost his way. This script swings its dialogue like a club. No subtlety, no nuance; eventually it'll trap the audience and beat it to some degree of stunned, quivering submission. In strictly superficial terms, Anderson's work has never been better. Oversaturated desert colors, wacky small-town eccentricities and 1950s pop culture make for a unique visual playground that matches brilliantly with his style. If he could direct his focus there, on the things that make a Wes Anderson movie look and behave the way they do, while hooking up with a well-suited editing or writing partner, I think the results would be spectacular. As it stands, I'm not sure I've got the willpower to sit through another one like this."
Asteroid City (2023),"Didn't totally hook me here if I'm honest, but","I didn't know what to expect from 'Asteroid City', yet I got exactly what I expected from this director... Wes Anderson, that! As usual: love the aesthetic, the exquisite colour palette and the usual Wes vibes. Always fun seeing a bunch of known faces appear throughout. Jason Schwartzman and Scarlett Johansson are the standouts. A fair few others do well too, namely Bryan Cranston and Jeffrey Wright. Steve Carell is amusing in a small role, also. I've enjoyed some of Anderson's other works much more ('Fantastic Mr. Fox', 'The French Dispatch'), the story didn't totally hook me here if I'm honest, but this one is very much still a good film in my opinion."
Asteroid City (2023),Wes Anderson,"Why do we continue to allow these Wes Anderson films to gain popularity. They're simply terrible. Asteroid city in particular lacks any real plot, any real humour, the structure is all wrong. A film for Wes Anderson fans that may even test their loyalty. Imagine having one of the best casts at your disposal and then using it for that, I'm actually disappointed in all the actors who participated. This band wagon of Wes Anderson films should die off now, I hope. Throughout the entire film I was wishing for the end. These are the times I wish I didn't have a rule to finish everything I've started."
Asteroid City (2023),I typically leave positive reviews so let's see,"I did enjoy the sets, props, camera movements, and the way things were visually set up. Color choices were nice, in the scenes that were not black and white. I don't mind black and white; I was born in the late eighties and was raised on many wonderful black and white tv shows. I appreciate when a movie feels different than what I've seen. I can also see how speaking styles are a choice, for example Gilmore Girls being a very fast paced run- not to necessarily compare this to a tv series, but it was the example I thought of for comparison. Perhaps Shakespeare is another- as rhythm is to be considered. Perhaps I need to rewatch this movie, or simply another by the same director. I enjoyed the students, as they are intelligent and interesting. I'm not sure that I enjoyed the movie as a whole though, despite the scientific and sci-fi touches."
Asteroid City (2023),Like eating an expired pound of bologna on the most expensive plate and table possible,"The perfect example of worthlessness and boring. Other than that it still sucks. Great A list of actors, a little bit of funky style, and a ton of dry boring exaggerated meaningless babbling of dialogue. Must have been written as a bet on whether an A list filled movie could make it on the actors abilities alone. Maybe it's something the CIA dreamed up under orders from the elites that are controlling the entire planet and manipulating us towards a braindead existence. I'm hoping to remember the film maker's name, the writer's name, and the directors name so I can avoid any future painful losses of an hour and forty five minutes."
Asteroid City (2023),Huh????,"I'm not really familiar with Wes Anderson's work. But, I mean, I have no idea what I just watched. I really tried to get it. This movie has an incredible cast, the majority of which are award winning or nominated; the main reason for my three stars. Tom Hanks, Willem DeFoe, Scarlett, Margot, Bryan; what's not to like, right? But it was just so bizarre. I love movies and I appreciate that there is a huge amount of work and artistic vision that goes into them, but this one really lost me. Was it supposed to be deep or humorous or artsy fartsy, I don't know. Maybe I just didn't get it. Was it just me?"
Asteroid City (2023),1:45 of my life I won't get back,"I wish the storyline had been as enjoyable as the cinematography and the acting. I realize this is one of those ""art films"" and I can usually enjoy those. But this one just didn't make sense. The set was beautiful and would be enjoyable to visit. The casting/acting were outstanding so I kept waiting for a defining moment in the film, but it never arrived (even during the closing credits). The storyline was straightforward with an occasional clever line in the script. As my title states, it's 1:45 of my life I'll never get back. I even hesitated writing a review but I felt that it might save someone else from wasting their time on this film."
Asteroid City (2023),Utter junk.,"I'd have had more fun spending an hour and a half getting a colonoscopy performed on me. It is worse than Movie 43, though not as offensive as Movie 43... but I haven't watched as much ""A"" list star power go to waste since, Movie 43. If I wasn't sitting next to my wife, who kept on insisting that ""it will get better"", I would have had the pleasure of stopping this movie 10 minutes in. It is a terrible movie that is trying to be ""artsy"", but is just pretentious. Anderson probably thinks he made some masterpiece. He did not. What he made was a terrible waste of an hour and a half. How this thing got 6.5 stars is beyond me. Schedule yourself a doctors appointment instead of watching this. It is awful!!!"
Asteroid City (2023),SO BAD it's offensive,"I doubt I've ever seen a movie worse than this one, and I'm sure I've never seen a cast this good get completely wasted. This thing is so bad that I'm doubting I'll be able to express just how extremely bad it is. There are some nice images in the cinematography, but citing them would be something like commenting on the nice weather at your execution. The entire effort is a waste, so much so that it's baffling to me how such an abomination can get made. In fact, 'waste' is a word that keeps coming to mind regarding this trash. I huge waste of time for viewers, a waste of talent and money. My hope is this garbage might help stem the flow of sewage that we know as Hollywood movies. If Hollywood were on trial for their lack of imagination and shallowness, this movie could serve as Exhibit A."
Asteroid City (2023),BRILLIANT!!,"Entertaining and enjoyable from beginning to end. Destined to become a beloved cult classic. Every actor shines brightly under the direction of Wes Anderson Anderson. The child actors at times even outshine the adult actors. The adult actors are superb. As a writing team, Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola are on a stellar level all their own. The production teams, casting, sets, and music, blend perfectly to make Asteroid City a gem and a joy. My children and friends will each be encouraged by me to watch this work of genius and fun. My hope is that the actors and crew enjoyed making it as much as I enjoyed watching it."
Last Christmas (2019),Don't miss this Christmas movie equal to Its A Wonderful Life!,This is the Best Christmas Movie with a message since Its A Wonderful Life. Excellent dialogue and acting especially by the Leads. Her singing is also frosting on the cake!! Kate's character is so believable and complex. It's the story of Family and friends and how to deal w the bad things in life in a positive light. The family dynamics are so true for all nationality's. This movie is about love and loss and learning to give back w no expectations. It is about forgiveness and acceptance of our eccentric parents ways with unconditional love. I was very intrigued w how it treated sex and love. P po lease watch it. It will give new meaning to Christmas.
Last Christmas (2019),Definitely worth watching,"I don't know why the bad reviews, the only problem I had with this movie was to give it a 8 or a 9. Excellent story, refreshing Christmas movie, finally watched it in 2023, been wanting to, really good acting from Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding, Michele Yeah and a lot of others as well as of course Emma Thompson as usual. Really makes you think, which is good as some people don't do that, funny and sad, had it all in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this movie, but have some tissues handy. Good lessons for us all to remember! I will probably watch it again even though I know the ending because it is that good. Also love the way it was filmed and the London scenery as well."
Last Christmas (2019),An Interesting Movie No Matter Which Way You Interpret It,"The implication here seems to be that it's sort of A Christmas Carol with the ghost of Christmas past providing a Christmas present and possible future for a cynical and self-destructive woman. But honestly as a thinking person it seems very clear to me that it could all be an enormous delusion suffered by an obviously mentally ill woman who is so angry at her relatively normal and non-abusive parents that she chooses to be homeless on the streets of London, crashing on people's couches, upsetting her oldest friends, boss and sister - and nearly losing her job due to her heavy drinking and lack of healthy self-care. As a horror movie fan I am not sure I have ever seen this trope played out in a romantic comedy - though it's extremely common in horror i.e. Is this person insane or is that a ghost or does the person's mental instability and so forth actually allow them to be more open to supernatural forces etc. I enjoyed this movie, I wasn't expecting the twist, and I can definitely see how it isn't for everyone."
Last Christmas (2019),Instant favorite Christmas movie!,"First of all, forgive me because I didn't even know about Henry Golding before this movie, and he was charming and witty and his character was great. I had no idea what to expect with this movie, and it blew me completely away. Loved the characters, the storyline, the acting, and of COURSE, the music. You don't have to love George Michael to love this movie but if you ARE a George Michael fan, then this movie will appeal to you even more. Really enjoyed that aspect of it. Emilia Clarke - whom I'd also never seen before - was just adorable and did an OUTSTANDING job. I mean, there's very little not to like here but she stole the show and she was great with Henry Golding. Characters, as I mentioned, were great and cast well chosen. Michelle Yeoh, Emma Thompson, they were all great. I don't want to say any more to spoil anything. Let's just say I understand why so MANY people rated this so highly. It touched me, and it became a movie we'll watch every year now and maybe not even necessarily only at Christmastime."
Last Christmas (2019),No such thing as normal...,"Slow burner. Emilia gaining acclaim with this film and Me Before You. Forget Game of Drones. Emma Thompson quirky as fff. Songs fabulous from Saint George. Andrew Ridgeley spotted at end looks just like his dad Albert. Camerawork imaginative. Script almost bonkers. Boyfriend called Boy ! Covent Garden looks fab. Actors brill and amazing casting. PC Trenchant Old Baggage WTF
Incidental music lovely. Tom is a fantastic part. The moral diversity of the story at the time of writing is more poignant than ever before at Christmas 2023. It's a beautiful film and will be a classic for absolutely everyone in the family....give it a couple of years, please have a heart x."
Last Christmas (2019),Bloopers for balkans 🤣🤣🤣,"As Balkan people this was hilarious to us. Yugoslavia fell apart in 1991. And she is singing in 1999. In plot is written Baltic War and we are Balkan nor Baltic. The actor playing her dad is Serbian with a Serbian accent, and her mother is making tiramisu for Christmas which is not at all a Balkan tradition for Christmas. The curse words are hilarious to hear because they say it so fast and wrong that it should be done with voiceover. Honestly, this was something so morbid and funny to us because it takes 5minutes to see where is Balkan and where is Baltic and how we speak. This is a mix of all and misrepresentation. Somebody couldn't do their due diligence to see all mistakes. But it laughed us so hard so at the end it gets a pass."
Last Christmas (2019),A little gem if you are a bit sentimental,"""Last Christmas"" is a heartwarming and delightful film that seamlessly blends romance, humor, and a touch of holiday magic. Emilia Clarke's charismatic performance, coupled with the charming storyline and George Michael's timeless music, creates an enchanting experience. The film's message about love, forgiveness, and the joy of giving makes it a perfect choice for a feel-good holiday movie. I'm liking this more than 'love actually' because I kinda love the underdog. People need to be nice to each other more and this movie captures why. Watch and let it all wash over you while you, sip a wine with the one you care for. Yes, I know 😎😎😎"
Last Christmas (2019),Tis The Season To Be Cruddy,"Oh yes, it's that time of year again, where people dump their emotions into Hallmark movies. Which I approve deeply. These movies absolutely write themselves. And, if you are remotely schmaltzy, you appreciate the intention behind them. Which is to make people feel less lonely. Because love will be discovered. In this case, not so much. You feel even more lost and lonely after this. For a few reasons. Let me backtrack a little. It's wild to believe this garbage was written by the brilliant Emma Thompson. And it took her a decade to come up with the concept. Which was based on a Wham! Tune. Which happens to be one of my favorite Christmas tunes. Listen to the lyrics closely would never have me think the outcome of this flick is about a woman with a heart ailment (something hammered down with words, but not necessarily shown through action) that gets a transplant and lives her life recklessly. Perhaps it was the casting of imp Emilia Clarke that lost it for me. She isn't convincing as a self destructive Yugoslavian. She's saying all the right words but dancing a different tune. Some people aren't meant for physical comedy and she falls under this category. Perhaps a young Drew Barrymore could pull this off. For some reason, every pratfall and delivered line was a colossal miss. MAYBE, it was the writing. I mean, you can see the words on the script pages. MAYBE, it was director Paul Feig that phoned this one in. Because every line is a wheezy fail. Poor Michelle Yeoh who slings out English slang as if she were given line reads by a 15 year old teen girl. Oof. So the conceit will pay off (sort of) when the truth is revealed. Because the love interest of Henry Golding makes zero sense. She, somehow, falls for the dude a little too quick. And the story relies heavily on the immediacy to be something you try to re-watch to see how their relationship would even work. The entire movie feels hollow. It wants you to feel a certain way. But there isn't enough character development to make it work. For instance, the mysterious Golding doesn't allow enough background to make his reveal seem so moving. In fact, it feels tragic when it should feel buoyant. They want this to be a romantic comedy, but none of it hits. Including Emma Thompson (as Clarke's Mom) painfully vomit out a caricature character. It's painful to sit through. Look, the heart (literally) is in the right place. However, what makes it exceptionally weird is to have the entire needle drop soundtrack also have George Michael be the Greek chorus of what is happening in her life. Remarkable that the amount of music would've cost this production the cost of the production itself. In a ironic way, the death of George Michael is a dark cloud that should be more of a celebration of his music. Given the poor execution on all levels, it seems much more depressing. This would include veteran lenser John Schwartman's waste of romantic lighting of London during Christmas time. For something which is suppose to glow, seems generically digital and cheap. Sad times."
Last Christmas (2019),Held My Interest,"Sweet entertainment not violent, sexy or profane. A good clean family movie with a plot twist that got me. Title of the movie was a big hit song by WHAM, but George Michael's fabulous voice gave me chills. The myriad songs sung by George Michael fit in nicely with the plot. The movie moved along with twists and turns that fit beautifully with the London street views. Loved the Christmas decorations and light displays. Overall, a surprise ending...a movie with a soft message. The actors, in my opinion, were cast appropriately and delivered a stellar performance without being a corny Ron-Con snooze-fest. Seeing Andrew Ridgeley in a cameo shot at the end was nice, as his friendship and collaboration with the late George Michael was fabulously successful."
Last Christmas (2019),Wow!,"I watched this film last year on Christmas day and it filled me with joy and sadness!! Last year's Christmas wasn't exactly what I would have imagined but when I watched this film it made me all kinds of emotions. The plot was absolutely divine and the leads had a lot of chemistry between them. I personally love Henry Golding films and Emilia Clarke films and to see them both together in this Christmas romance ,well you can imagine my emotions. This isn't your usually girl meets boy romance were they fall in love but it's more like girl meets boy, boy gave her her heart and she can never give it back . I recommend this film with all my heart and don't listen to the haters who have nothing to do in their lives but critic a film like this."
Four Christmases (2008),Sends The Wrong Message,"The movie starts with a couple that is happy with what they have in the non traditional lifestyle. They don't need or want marriage or kids. Their friends and family judge them for this even though they are happy. By the end they are peer pressured despite all the evidence proving their stance to be correct to conform to the norm. The comedy may not be to everyone's taste though I enjoyed it. Though after the second christmas it felt like they started to speedrun the story with the third christmas being short and the fourth practically nonexistent. I could see how the movie was going to end by the halfway point but it still pissed me off. I have never been so angry at an xmas movie. Luckily it was the end of the night when I watched it, but it still left me angry. Even now I am fuming about that ending a day later."
Four Christmases (2008),"Some Cute Moments, But...","I really love Vince Vaughn and really like Reese Witherspoon. This movie does a decent job at showcasing their relative talents. There are a number of memorably funny scenes at the various Christmas celebrations they attend when their plane gets delayed. Robert Duvall and Jon Favreau are very funny in the limited scenes they are in. Mary Steenburgen is very likable and well utilized. Krista Cheneworth has some funny scenes. Dwight Yokum is good. The movie has some sentimental rom/com moments. The Nativity Play is the best part part. The movie just doesn't do a great job in tying it all together. It could have been much, much funnier and used their talents more effectively. Some of the scenes are way too contrived even for comedy."
Four Christmases (2008),FOURMulaic Christmas,"This movie makes it clear pretty early on exactly how the story is going to play out. We have our two main characters, played by Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn, who don't like spending time with their family for Christmas. The character arc that the two are going to go through becomes apparent very early on. As the title implies, the couple go to four different family Christmases. The first two Christmases are so over the top and detached from reality that the movie loses any relatability with the audience. The jokes do not land, and when they don't, they linger on them for way too long. It's like they'll tell the joke, and then repeat the same thing with 4 different punchlines. The bickering couple routine gets old really fast, and no one would believe Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon as a couple. But, with all that said, the movie is harmless enough. It gives you exactly what the premise promises. And it manages to do it all in under 90 minutes. It maybe fourgetable, but I'll fourgive it, and I'll give it a 4 out of 10."
Four Christmases (2008),Criminally Underrated. A Very Solid Christmas Movie.,"Four Christmases is WAY better than I remembered it being. I think people dismiss this movie because of the puke jokes, the crass ""Southern working class"" stereotypes, the kids hitting and jumping on adults. I get it. But I'd argue all of that is window dressing - attempts to keep this film as a comedy - rather than the ""point"" of the movie. Four Christmases - stay with me here - is a meditation on family, relationships, and Christmas. Unlike so many other films, this one has a more grounded take than I expected: family isn't perfect, Christmas doesn't solve all of the problems, sometimes family members are just bad for you to be around and maybe, it's okay to acknowledge that. But, with all of this in mind, family grounds us; they're people we don't choose to be around, but people we're around because we all need people in our lives who will be with us, no matter how different we are. There's something special about connecting with a person who isn't ""exactly"" like you and finding something to appreciate. I really like the ethos of this movie; that this no-it all, protypical liberal couple - Vaughn and Witherspoon - realize that for all their freedom, they don't have the depth of connection their family members do; all their condescension and status flies out the window. Yeah, this movie is deeper than you probably remember. It's also pretty funny, with some really standout jokes and actors who are generally really great. John Favreau is a scene stealer, playing so far away from type, it's a joy every time he's on screen. Kristin Chenoweth is solid as well, but come on...Sissy Spacek? Robert Duvall? John Voight? Mary Steenburgen? This cast is stacked with legends who do an amazing job and give the film a ""ghosts of Christmas"" vibe with how different they all are. Oddly enough, I think Vaughn and Witherspoon are fine here; really anyone could've played these characters, and it's the other actors who make this movie for me. Is this movie predictable? A little silly? A bit low brow? Sure. Is it fun? Yes. Does it have heart? Yes. It's a solid Christmas comedy and I think I'd recommend it to basically anyone looking for some laughs with their cheer."
Four Christmases (2008),That's it. I'm done with this movie!,"I watched this movie once before and just decided yesterday, for the heck of it, to watch it again. Big mistake! Now I know why I told myself, ""Don't watch this thing again!"" the last time I watched it. With all the big names in this movie, you'd think it would be a lot better. But it's not! This is one of the most ""UNChristmasy"" Christmas movie around! Just...yuck! And why is that? Well, it could be that this movie is chock-full of incredibly mean-spirited and unlikable people...which doesn't make for the best holiday fuzzy wuzzy feelings. Not that I like Hallmark-style sappiness. But this is just the opposite extreme. In the movie, Reese Witherspoon's character and Vince Vaughn's character are a couple who want desperately to be ""untraditional."" No marriage...no babies...no families at Christmas. (And yes, both of their parents are divorced...hence the ""four Christmases"" we end up being subjected to). This couple makes up elaborate excuses as to why they cannot visit their parents and respective families on the holidays. They claim they are ""helping orphans"" or ""building houses for the poor in some third world country,"" that sort of cliche thing. But really, they are embarking on fun tropical vacays and just enjoying themselves without having to deal with any of that pesky family responsibility stuff. (And after we ""meet"" their families, we sort of understand why they do this). Well, one year they get caught at the airport with their lame excuses; the plane is grounded, and they are now forced to go visit their families on Christmas. And hey.....this wouldn't even be such a bad plot! I mean...it has possibilities for depth and humor combined. It really does! However....the movie definitely drops the ball, starting with the very first family the couple goes to visit...Vince Vaughn's father (played by Rober Duval) and his horribly aggressive brothers who are constantly attacking and wrestling and their respective kids and wife and baby, etc... The jokes all fall flat; the families and kids and brothers and father are all just hideous and unlikable...they all jump on Vince Vaughn's character accusing him of being ""weak"" and a ""snob"" and etc...There is lots of over-acting and just flat-out bad acting and everything is overdone and over-the-top, so it just isn't even believable. The characters are all so one-dimensional. Not a fun experience...not very funny to watch. Okay, maybe there are one or two tiny laughs in the dialogue, but that is not enough! Then it's onto the next ""Christmas,"" with Reese Witherspoon's mother (played by Mary Steenburgen) and assorted characters here, like a sister and baby and a minister (the new ""boyfriend"" of the mother) and a horrible little girl, etc... We find out things about Reese Witherspoon's character's past...like she used to be overweight, and everyone thought she had ""cooties."" the family sits around laughing at pictures of Reese as a chubby baby....unbelievable, right? What a terribly mean thing to do! And on Christmas, no less. Not funny! Not funny, at all! Why is being ""mean"" being presented as humor, I wonder? Then there is an equally unfunny mean scene in a ""bouncy castle"" with kids acting like evil little bullies...and through-out, there is Reese Witherspoon wondering where her relationship is ""going"" and if indeed she wants children...(and I don't know why she would, after all the horrible children she encounters in this movie). Then...it's two more equally unfunny Christmases for us to endure. The one with Sissy Spacek (Vince Vaugn character's mom) and her super young boyfriend is slightly funny...but only slightly. It is here that the two main characters have a fight...and the last Christmas, at Reese's father's house (her father is played by. John Voight...one of the only ""nice"" characters in the whole movie) we see that the Vince Vaugn character doesn't even participate. And then, folks...it's on to the most cliched ending in movie history!!!! No spoilers here...(yes, you can suffer through this movie to find out the ending, if you have the stomach for it)! Anyway, I will say that Reese Witherspoon did a decent job. So that is why I'm giving the movie two points. All for her! But as for Vince Vaugn....he was so bad! That fast-talking style gets really annoying! And he is downright rude to Reese's character a few times, which in my opinion, makes him a real jerk. So! Do I recommend this movie? Ha! I think it's obvious I emphatically do NOT! However, if you want to watch to just see how bad it is...be my guest! Like I said....the movie had a somewhat decent premise. And yes, there may be a few tiny laughs. But...don't expect anything more!"
Four Christmases (2008),Funniest Christmas Movie Ever... for adults,I adore the plot of this movie. Why not have a comedy Christmas movie revolving around the theme of avoiding your dysfunctional families during the holidays? There are a few legendary scenes in this movie that are totally realistic and hysterical. Basically this movie is about rejection of societal expectations and pressures around the holidays. Vince Vaughn and Reece Witherspoon have outstanding performances and their chemistry is sizzling. I'm wondering if all of the negative reviews were expecting a traditional holiday rom com movie or something? This movie cracks me up big time. It is on my must watch December holiday movie list.
Four Christmases (2008),"Hidden gem, or ignored one?","8.1 stars. This is exactly the kind of movie that attracts my attention. There is so much psychoanalysis going on between Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn back-and-forth and it's all about relationships, and the depth of true love. Take all the weird and silly comedy and put it aside, and you have a magnificent love story between two people who are young-ish well to do, actually quite snooty and standoffish, yet endearing. When I think about the accolades this movie deserves, I hesitate for a moment, and, as I pause to reflect upon the hidden gem that 'Four Christmases' is, I realize that it's obviously not the most popular film. On the other hand, it's always popping up on this or that platform, it's obvious that millions of people love it and maybe they just won't admit it. I am here to say this is a great movie, all the elements proclaim: ""instant classic"" you have to see this. I think this is my fifth time. Where Vaughn brings his usual shtick, Witherspoon reciprocates with a wonderful charisma that only Reese can. She truly is one of the greats. Lots of big names in this!"
Four Christmases (2008),Give me more Reese,"I was abducted tied up and forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend. I actually kind of liked it. Almost gave it a seven which is coveted on my scale. It's at least a 6.5. Vince Vaughn almost always makes me laugh and entertains me, and Reese Witherspoon is the object of my affection. ABOUT MY REVIEWS: I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it. My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable."
Four Christmases (2008),Happy 15th Anniversary to Four Christmases,"Fifteen years ago today, Four Christmases came out in theaters. This is one of my four favorite Christmas movies (the others being Christmas Vacation, Elf, and Just Friends) My favorite scenes from Four Christmases are: When Brad Also Known As Orlando (Vince Vaughn) tells his nephews that there dad is Santa Claus and when his youngest nephew goes outside streaking, When Brad, his brothers and nephews are fighting/wrestling and the oldest nephew says Google Me, B**ch, when Kate's (Reese Witherspoon's) baby niece throws up on her and Brad starts gagging, and the bounce house scene. With that being said, Happy 15th Anniversary to Four Christmases."
Four Christmases (2008),"Four families, one day, no mercy.","Four Christmases is a 2008 comedy about a married couple who learns they don't know each other as well as they thought after being forced to spend Christmas with each others family over the course of one day. Say what you will about this one, but I thought it was a decent movie that for what it lacked in certain areas it made up for in others. It's not that creative, and the jokes aren't amazing, but it has some great actors in it, and enough fun moments that I found the overall film enjoyable. It won't win any awards, but it's also not the worst 89 minutes I've ever spent either. If you haven't seen this before, I'd recommend checking it out and see what you think."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),Romantic Fun with Comedy and Adult Conversations,"This plot is what you expect. But, the writing is truly adult conversations with grown up relationship witticisms. Not the tripe of Hallmark. We both enjoyed it and it was nice to hear clever dialogue. There's a talented cast (even the kids seemed to appeared as you'd expect). The two main actors are definitely winners and worth checking out. And the secondary actors are strong in their own right. They provide the comical aspect. The story kept the banker way in the background so you don't see any ludicrous across the desk back and forth or whining. A couple hours of fun and easy enjoyment. If you are into romantic comedies you should definitely give this one a look."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),"Wines, town, millionaires","This movie comes out in the Christmas category on Netflix, however its basis itself is not Christmas, only the last 10 minutes mention Christmas, so if what you are looking for is a movie about Christmas, this is not the movie. However, it is an enjoyable film, it has the cliché story of a capricious millionaire boy, who leads a chaotic life and is sent to a town incognito to discover information about a wine company that his family wants to buy, there he meets in this town to a widow with 2 children who wants to buy this company together with other neighbors. Carter begins to relate to her, her children and her people, ultimately changing her way of being. It is a film to spend the afternoon, enjoy, not complicated."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),Hallmark Soap Opera Christmas Movie,"Holiday in the Vineyards is a Netflix B rated romantic comedy and our sixth Christmas movie of 2023. The story is about a big city playboy who is sent to outbid an estate sale in a fictional California town called Los Santos. The city name is also described in GTA within the same content as this film. The playboy played by Josh Swickard ends up helping and working for a widower and her two boys. The widower is played by Sol Rodriguez along with her best friend Carly Jibson and the town carpenter who is played by Omar Gooding. Eileen Davidson played Josh's mother who ends up buying the land that was previously owned by the family back in the early 1900's. Most of these characters are stars from the soap opera shows, good actors but subpar slow predictable storyline. I will never watch or remember this one again."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),good movie,"A widow who wants to save a local vineyard meets a stranger both fell in love but she has certain limitations like her two kids, save the local vineyard or the stranger. Her struggle and emotions beautifully captured. When she came to know that, the stranger is a well known businesswoman's son, did she take it forward? A romantic film, which is a feel good movie and a good entertainer to watch this movie on Christmas. Dont miss. Watch this beautiful Christmas Movie, and Merry Christmas. Watch this movie on Netflix. Rating: Good Movie. Follow my blog for regular reviews on famus.blogspot."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),It's all grape juice to me but this is a fun flick,"Even if you don't drink wine, this is a solid, fun rom com just in time to take your mind off the dystopian disfunction that is the modern world, and most of what Netflix puts out. Like all rom coms it is predictable but it is also fun along the way. The performances and execution are top notch. The male lead is great. He is funny and convincing. And his eventual love interest has the charm and spark of a young Salma Hayek, (sans juggs). They even a have a real housewife of somewhere. I don't like those shows but I'm happy to see one of them channeling all that drama up onto the big screen where it worked well. And have to admit it, she was good. All in all this is a fun flick worth checking out."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),Josh brings his best feature,"There are several axes upon which to rate a film, but for a Josh Swickard film, the most important is clearly how good does Josh look in this film, how often is he shirtless, is his chest well lit or in shadows, and how much as he trimmed his chest hair. On those critical factors, this is his 2d best feature film. While it offers almost the same number and quality of shirtless scenes as in the original ""A California Christmas,"" his chest is way overly clipped here and he almost looks smooth. The original CC showed him off at his most hirsute and he looked great. There was also a gay couple and a little more heart in that movie. Anyway, I did enjoy this flick for what is was, though ""Die Hard"" is arguably more of a Christmas flick. All the craftsmanship was serviceable. Thank you Josh and Netflix for some lite fun holiday fare."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),Are you kidding me?,"Don't even need to watch this to know. Did multiple double takes though just to make sure I wasn't crazy because this is just a lazy rip off of ""A California Christmas"" with the same lead actor! Wtf?! Are you serious? How many times is Netflix just gunna rehash the same old story? A Cali Xmas wasn't even that good. It was slightly above average for an average sappy love story from Netflix and that's not saying much. Maybe not even that because the 2 leads are very easy on the eyes so they probably mask a lot of the movies short comings, if you're brain dead and content with just drooling over them I guess. I have no words. Just lazy. But it's Netflix so can we expect anything else?"
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),"Proper film, feel good and with great cast","I love an upbeat festive film but they can be a wee bit twee so I was pleasantly surprised by something that felt relative to today's world and not just a throwback to old school mills n boon romance. Great chemistry between all cast, rounded characters a female lead you could have a good girls night out with, and a very funny (and ripped!) male co-star. Sure there's some schmaltzy bits but hey, it's a Christmas rom com so that's kinda required, but it's all thoroughly entertaining and the script and acting elevated it above the bog standard formulaic afternoon movies which are fine to pass the time, but this is better :-) raise your glasses and sample some delicious festive fun."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),"Would rather watch paint dry, loading bars load, or grass grow.","Very rarely do I leave negative reviews. The Room had better story and plot. Wait, is this a Tommy Wiseau film? Nope; well Alex is following in Tommy's footsteps. Highly doubt this becomes a cult classic though. Drudging on, every character in this film lives in some sort of alternate reality where the forces of our own bear no weight on them. Even the most privileged of people in the reality we live in have more self awareness and social awareness than any character in this film. Now to criticize the actual people from our own plane of existence; the director, producers, and anybody who made a decision in the production of this film floundered in a sea of opportunity. Every scene was just scraping the surface of what could have made for actual entertainment or funny dialog, but alas it was watered down. On the scale of pasteurized milk, this film is a 0%."
A Wine Country Christmas (2023),Privileged wino makes good,"If you're looking for a fun, feel good rom com to take your mind off reality for a couple hours you've found it. You've got a talented cast (even the kids seemed to be pretty good actors for kids in a movie like this), a fun if familiar storyline and some great dialogue. The two main actors are definitely up and comers and definitely worth checking out. This movie won't change your politics or cause you to question any of your major life decisions, but it's a couple hours of fun that flies by like a Christmas party with old friends. If you are into rom coms you should definitely give this one a watch."
Dune (2021),Sheer Spectacle,"Being a fan of the original series of books for Dune, and also having watched the first attempt to adapt this story, I was skeptical of how well this large and ever-encompassing tale could be taken from paper to the big screen. Upon watching the trailer, I thought that maybe this film would show the scale of the story, but still, I had little hope for the adaptation. I was incorrect. Yes, the scale is enormous, but this film truly encapsulates everything I would want in a true Dune film. I cannot wait to see what the next films hold, as this story is only getting started. Masterclass in cinematography and art."
Dune (2021),Well executed but far too SLOW,"It's definitely a good movie, generally well executed and true to the book. But since I like nitpicking, here are some critical remarks: Pacing is WAY too slow. Every scene takes far too long. Everything is duly explained. The 1984 version was certainly too fast but this time they overcompensated for it. Some CGI scenes, especially the desert ones, look too clean and too clear, with no blurriness or grittiness. This gives the impression of it having been filmed in a TV studio. The Harkonnen lack the deeply sadistical touch of the 1984 version. This makes them appear far less deplorable. There are no really disturbing scenes, which may be because the producers wanted to avoid a 18+ rating. The race and gender swaps of some characters are unnecessary but not too irritating because it just a SF/fantasy movie, not a historical drama after all. There are no pugs, anywhere."
Dune (2021),Nice Epos with precise references,"When i first saw the movie, i was surprised on how good the movie was. The cast, music and plot made me watch the whole movie until the end. After i watched the movie, i read the book and except little things, the movie has precise references, at least with the dialogue. I recommend the movie for everyone who likes epic scenes and shots. Denis Villeneuve proved for me once again that he understands, how to tell a story. I can't wait to see the second part. The only thing which i find the critical was the lack of references of buddhistic-islamic references, which are part of the original narrative of Frank Herbert."
Dune (2021),"""Dune"" is big, imposing and impactful. An epic visual spectacle that in essence, is a political-religious allegory with environmental concerns","Since they were published in 1965, Frank Herbert's books have inspired the creation of worlds like those of ""Star Wars"" and ""Game of Thrones"", which means that this return to the original story is nothing new, but something extremely familiar. Thus, without the novelty factor, director Denis Villeneuve bets on the grandeur of this universe as a differentiator and presents an epic like we haven't seen in cinema for a long time. Everything in ""Dune"" is big, imposing and impactful. Written by Eric Roth, Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve himself, ""Dune: Part One"" introduces us to Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, who in the year 10,191 have their rivalry accentuated when Emperor Shaddam IV removes the latter from control of the planet Arrakis and the transfers the first time - something significant, since Arrakis is the only source of extraction of a substance whose value is inestimable. However, the Emperor's decision is not driven by favoritism towards the Atreides; on the contrary, he fears the popularity of Duke Leto Atreides (Isaac) and hopes that the transfer to the new planet will leave him vulnerable to an attack by his enemy, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard). Meanwhile, the Duke's son, young Paul (Chalamet), has been having visions that result from the powers inherited from his mother, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), a member of an ancient order made up of women who secretly orchestrate events in the Empire - and these Visions reveal that the boy may be the Chosen One prophesied millennia ago. Once again, there's no denying the awesomeness of Dune. Knowing that there was no way to innovate in terms of story and themes, Villeneuve bet all his chips on visual impact - and he succeeded. Dune is visually a spectacle even with its washed-out colors: the contrast between the planet Caladan (home of the Atreides) and Arrakis is remarkable, while Gledi Prime, planet of the Harkonnen, evokes a nightmare. Furthermore, the scale of the buildings - especially on Arrakis - is oppressive, rendering the humans (or humanoids) who inhabit them insignificant. To top it off, the costumes range from ceremonial ostentation to the practicality of life in the desert with creativity, managing to achieve verisimilitude without taking away from the fantasy. In this sense, it is also important to note the influences embraced by costume designer Jacqueline West, who adopts, for example, an aesthetic clearly inspired by Arab culture that, not by chance, mirrors Frank Herbert's own sources when conceiving the people of Arrakis. Visiting each of the planets is a truly impactful experience and everything is done to dazzle the viewer, from the construction of each scenario to the design of the ships, which take your breath away when they fill the entire screen. There is enormous care in this production work, ensuring that each house has its own identity, giving the feeling that the universe is truly vast and that each people is unique. But all this attention to detail takes time. Of the 2h40 film, an hour and a half are dedicated just to showing how things work, what houses are, the dynamics of the Empire, the importance of spice and the role of the planet Akarris in imperial geopolitics. He is entirely concerned with establishing his universe and, only after that, begins to tell his story. The problem is that, when this happens, the film comes to an end. Not intending to present the universe in its entirety, which would make the film very confusing, the script chose to introduce characters, basic concepts and establish the aesthetics of the saga. Of course, there is no conclusion, but there is no need for it. The film is honest and makes it clear at the beginning that it is the first part of a story. The point at which ""Dune (2021)"" ends is precisely when a change occurs in Paul's character. Featuring a notable cast that includes everyone from Charlotte Rampling to Zendaya (who has little to do other than serve as an ambiguous promise of love and violence for the protagonist), Dune has the luxury of featuring Javier Bardem in two or three scenes, Stellan Skarsgard practically unrecognizable under tons of prosthetics and Charlotte Rampling herself hidden by an almost impenetrable black veil). On the other hand, Jason Momoa gives charisma to the warrior Duncan Idaho, complementing Josh Brolin's (correctly) dry composition, while Oscar Isaac brings dignity and firmness to Duke Leto, which leads the viewer to recognize the difference between his House and that of the Harkonnens, even though both work to explore Arrakis. However, the most striking performances are those offered by Rebecca Ferguson and Sharon Duncan-Brewster: while the first evokes the ambivalence she experiences when recognizing the potential Chosen One in her son, demonstrating rigidity and affection in equal measure, the second transforms Dr. Liet Kynes in a figure who, already damaged by decades of exploration, hesitates to trust in the integrity of the Atreides, helping them when he deems it necessary, but making it clear that his pride and concern for the Fremen will always come first. To conclude, Timothée Chalamet embodies Paul with the intensity possible for a character who, let's be honest, is more archetype than individual - and if the boy often seems inexpressive, this is more due to the narrative function that the hero performs than to any another thing. But this negative aspect of not delving as much into the characters is also, in an incongruous way, one of the film's strengths and one that shows the production's courage. On the one hand, we have a series of characters who don't gain enough development for us to truly care about their fates, but, on the other, they work together like the living organism that pulses around Paul and Jessica, allowing These two have the spotlight pointed at them, creating all the necessary infrastructure for them to grow and for us to see this fascinating new world through them. When Dune ends and Chani, looking at mother and son (and, sideways, also at us), says, in all words, that ""this is just the beginning"", we realize that Villeneuve has fulfilled his mission of introducing us, building and developing the three main foundations of the expansive epic that Herbert's work required, something that perhaps shifting focus to the rest of the cast would not have made possible. The director carefully sacrificed several elements and characters - it may seem like the adaptation is exaggeratedly faithful, but the truth is that the adaptation work was extensive, with a lot of things being left out - in order to focus on what was truly important. Interestingly, however, especially considering the length of the film and what lies ahead, some character exclusions are surprising. House Corrino, of Emperor Shaddam IV, is not present except through emissaries. The navigators, who pilot the ships on interplanetary journeys, are not seen. Feyd Rautha, another nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Skarsgård), is not even mentioned. The gigantic sandworms, which are the real terror of those who want to extract spice, but, on the other hand, are gods for the native Fremen people, are only partially seen in a very interesting decision by Villeneuve, certainly to leave us with water in our mouths. Mouth. These absences, which, of course, will only be felt even by those who have read the book, are replaced by a bit of necessary expository text, notably through the protagonist's studies with tape recorders and visual aids and, above all, through contemplation, with Paul slowly, but clearly understanding his path and what he needs to do, with the cadence of events determined by Villeneuve's careful decoupage never allowing that feeling of confusion. ""Dune"" is, in essence, a political-religious allegory with environmental concerns that are reflected in the way the rich and powerful Houses feel entitled to invade Arrakis in order to extract its natural resources, ignoring the needs of the native Fremen (""free men""; it is not necessary to be subtle to be effective) and the way in which they integrate with nature in an organic and non-destructive way. Thus, if the substance coveted by the empire is a powdered version of oil, the Fremen display clear traces of Arab nations and Islam in their clothes, their language and some of their customs, and it is admirable to see how Herbert (and, consequently, Villeneuve) reverses the habitually prejudiced view with which Europe and the United States view those people. Villeneuve is one of the great directors of the current generation and he has shown himself to be increasingly adept at the Bene Gesserit mantra that says that fear kills the mind, that it is the small death that leads to annihilation, even experiencing box office failures as unfairly happened with its ""Blade Runner 2049"". His bet with Dune was risky, because, despite being a well-known book, it is a long, hermetic work that relatively few people have actually read and the division into two films is another element that only brings potential complications for the future of the film franchise. However, in the end, as much as this first part of ""Dune"" brings an epic veneer, it slips by not delivering the basics: a story for the audience to connect with. The fantastic world fills the eyes and takes your breath away, but that's not what people relate to and there's no production design that makes people get involved with a story that hasn't even begun. Even though the next chapters are as promising as the future of Paul Atreides, it is first necessary to convince the public to want to cross this desert - and that will be the real challenge. Considering all the choices the director made, especially the boldness of reducing the focus of the gigantic epic to the journey of a young man trying to find his way, it is nothing less than impressive, with chances of the final set being superior to the separate parts."
Dune (2021),Too slow and characters not developed,"The movie was very slow. If you haven't read the book, you will probably be lost. Also, without proper character development you don't even get surprised or annoyed when a betrayal happens. Well, if you like cool visuals, maybe the esthetics of the movie will compensate for the lack of the plot and character development. As for me, I don't care about the visual effects too much and honestly the music got a bit annoying at times. All in all this is one of the clear cases when I can say I liked the book much better. What is it with this character counts, now I am simply writing so that I have enough characters to post my review."
Dune (2021),A Sci Fi Masterpiece,"As someone who hasnt read the books of dune and knew nothing about this universe, I watched this movie with not so high expectations. But I was suprised by how amazing the universe (lore) and the story is. The movie kept getting better and better and I loved the writing, visuals, costums, world design , everything. A true Masterpiece that has some flaws but still the postive sides are way stronger. The Dune Universe is like Game of Thrones Universe but I think its better. I cant believe they made this movie with only 165 millions and I cant wait to watch the second movie, but this time in a cinema. I think we need alot more content from this Universe (like a TV show would be sick)."
Dune (2021),True to the story and then some!,"I hear the director of 1984's Dune wants ""nothing to do with this"" - golly, dude, it must really piss David Lynch off this version made *sense*, the mythology was on point, the presentation was just so utterly fantastic, the rich characters were true to each of their part, they were all believable and amazing. The sets were fantastic, too, it was so gorgeous to see the entire planet just so full of color and power. I read Dune in high school 40 years ago, THIS version does the tale justice! I didn't want it to end, but I know I am seriously anticipating being blown away by Part Two in 2024! Bravo!"
Dune (2021),Fantastic Remake: 5 for each part equals 10 out of 10,"I would definitely give 10 out of 10, except I saw part 1, and it was incomplete. Then waited 3 years for part two. So 5 out of 10 for each part. Now, if you're smart you would avoid the whole part 1 and part 2 thing, and stream them altogether when they are available. But as is, its just an incomplete cash grab. I saw the first part, but really did not get a sense of closure. Imagine that? Now I don't care if I see the second part. The hype is gone, and its not like we don't know what's going to happen. I'm sure after theatre release, this will be marketed in cohesive form. So lesson learned, no more part 1 incomplete epics for me."
Dune (2021),A Visually Mesmerizing and Ambitiously Faithful Adaptation,"Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal science fiction novel, ""Dune,"" is a visually arresting and narratively ambitious film that captures the essence of the source material while offering a cinematic experience that is both epic and intimate. Released in 2021, this film is a testament to the power of visual storytelling and the potential of science fiction to explore complex themes. Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, the young heir to the noble House Atreides. Chalamet delivers a nuanced performance, capturing Paul's transition from a sheltered nobleman to a leader embroiled in a complex interstellar conflict. His portrayal embodies the character's depth, intelligence, and burgeoning sense of destiny. The supporting cast is stellar, with standout performances from Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, and Stellan Skarsgård as the menacing Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Each actor brings gravitas and complexity to their roles, enriching the film's expansive narrative. Villeneuve's direction is masterful. He crafts a visually stunning world that is both alien and familiar, capturing the grandeur and danger of the desert planet Arrakis. The film's visual effects are not just impressive in their technical execution but are integral to the storytelling, immersing the viewer in the world of ""Dune."" The screenplay, co-written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, remains faithful to Herbert's novel, preserving its political intrigue, philosophical depth, and cultural richness. The film delves into themes of power, destiny, and ecological stewardship, offering a thoughtful exploration of Herbert's ideas. Hans Zimmer's score is another highlight, providing an atmospheric and immersive soundscape that complements the film's visual splendor. The music is both haunting and epic, enhancing the film's sense of scale and emotional depth. However, ""Dune"" is not without its challenges. The film's pacing can feel slow at times, focusing more on world-building and atmosphere than on fast-paced action. Additionally, as the first installment of a planned two-part adaptation, the film ends on an open note, which might leave some viewers unsatisfied. Some characters and subplots are not as fully developed as they could be, a limitation likely due to the vast scope of the source material and the constraints of a cinematic runtime. This may impact viewers who are not already familiar with the novel. In conclusion, ""Dune"" is a remarkable achievement in science fiction filmmaking. It successfully adapts a famously complex novel into a visually spectacular and narratively engaging film. While it may not fully stand alone as a self-contained story, it sets the stage for an epic saga. Its combination of visual mastery, thoughtful storytelling, and strong performances earn it a well-deserved 8 out of 10. ""Dune"" is not just a film; it's an immersive experience that captures the imagination and invites viewers into a richly crafted world."
Dune (2021),Slow and empty,"Do yourself a favour and go watch the Dune mini series from 2000 and then the Children of dune mini series from 2003. More story, more substance. Unless you are concerned primarily with visuals of course, which is all this movie wins in. The two miniseries are a better depiction of the stories in the books, whereas this film is extremely empty and slow and boring. Even though part 2 is coming out, pat one was a wasted opportunity to really root the series. Unfortunately that didn't happen here so your best bet is to read the books or go and watch the two mini-series mentioned above between 2000 and 2003."
Aquaman (2018),Goofy-Ahh-Goofy,"Like I said in the title of this review, this is one of the goofiest DC movies of all time. But it's a good thing that it embraces it, and doesn't take it too seriously like some other films. Black Manta is pretty cool, and I kind of liked that they side-lined him, so they could make him the villain in the sequel. (Which they did, thankfully). Orm is a pretty villain, because well, you hate him throughout the entire film, and that's what villains are well...supposed to be. Jason Momoa played Aquaman really well in this film, and the entire DCEU. I'm going to miss you, man. I'm going to miss all of the JL cast. Even if most of the DCEU films got mixed reviews, the actors in them did the best that they could, and they did very well with their roles. If Aquaman's dad dies in the 2nd, I am going to be very sad. Don't any of you guys spoil it for me, please. I literally cannot remember anything spoilery with this film. Oh yeah, Arthur's mum kind of dies, but doesn't, and she is played by Nicole Kidman. Then, our fellow Water Friend gets very angry at his own brother in the water world, and they fight to the death, but for their first fight, Waterboy gets injured, and the pitchfork that he used, and his brother broke was his mothers. So he had to go onto a quest with Amber Heard, and get the trident of King Poseidon, and defeat Loki, I mean, um, Orm. Yes, Orm. So, for 2nd try, Waterboy wins by defeating his brother on top of a boat or something, and they all lived happily ever after. The end, boyos! Final Scores:
Plot: 6/10. Pacing: 5/10. Cinematography: 5/10. Characters: 9/10. Costumes: 10/10. Acting: 8/10. Music: 7/10. Overall: 7/10. It's decent. And if you want entertainment, campiness, and metal music, you'll get this here."
Aquaman (2018),Good chemistry between Jason Momoa and Amber Heard,"""Aquaman"" is an exhilarating cinematic experience that successfully brings the underwater world of Atlantis to life. The film's stunning visuals, intricate world-building, and Jason Momoa's charismatic performance as Arthur Curry contribute to its undeniable appeal. Amber Heard's portrayal of Mera adds depth to the character, combining strength and grace seamlessly. Heard's on-screen chemistry with Momoa enhances the overall dynamic of the film, creating a captivating and believable connection between their characters. Her performance adds a refreshing and empowering touch to the superhero genre, making ""Aquaman"" a standout film that not only entertains but also showcases diverse and compelling characters."
Aquaman (2018),A Seaworthy Saga with Spectacle to Spare!!!,"As origin stories go, James Wan's ""Aquaman"" is a seaworthy saga with spectacle to spare, and Jason Momoa of ""Fast X"" is perfectly cast as the exuberant man who is as at home on dry land as he is beneath the sea. Nevertheless, there are moments when you wonder if the filmmakers weren't trying to forge a new franchise that borrows heavily from the British myth of Excalibur, just to mention one, as well as ""Star Wars."" The origin segments seem more spontaneous and emotionally charged than the clash for power between Aquaman and his chief adversary King Orm (Patrick Wilson of ""Watchmen"") over who will command the undersea armies and wear the crown as the king of the seven seas. Orm's efforts to incite a war with land lovers and his hate for his half-brother Aquaman are straight out of a 1950s cavalry western where the hero is an army scout who has lived with the Indians and represents them. Sadly, Wan and scenarists David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall, working from a story by Geoff Johns, James Wan and Will Beall based on the DC Comics character created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger seem to borrow from George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" franchise with the equivalent of heroes and villains-tweaked of course-but comparable to Lucas' universe. For example, although he has less power and a longer life than Obi-Wan Kenobi, Willem Dafoe's character Vuklo is reminiscent of the Alec Guiness character because he mentors the youthful Aquaman in the ways of the seas and the use of underwater weaponry. Ultimately, what undercuts the best parts of ""Aquaman"" is the addition of a love story between our eponymous hero and Mer (Amber Heard of ""Drive Angry"") and the subplot involving Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II of ""Ambulance""). Clocking in at an intolerable 143 minutes, ""Aquaman"" suffers from a surfeit of plot. Initially, Wan and his collaborators could have jettisoned this flotsam of a subplot and saved it for the sequel. The clash of titans subplot that eventually leads to Aquaman becoming the king of the ocean is taken to extremes, too. We've seen this kind of filmmaking too often and it just clutters up the beautiful origins story between Aquaman's mom Atlanna (Nicole Kidman of ""Dead Calm"") and his lighthouse father Tom Curry (Temuera Morrison of ""Once Were Warriors""). It seems that Atlanna washed up with a wound literally on Curry's doorstep at his lighthouse tower and he nursed this babe back to health. They grew on each other and inevitably as is the case, they fell in love and gave birth to Arthur. The search for the ultimate Trident and the depths our brawny hero must go to in order to claim that elaborate fork as the symbol of his power is straight out of the King Arthur legend. Altogether, Wan and company go overboard and pack too much into their narrative net. Happily, produced at around $200 million, ""Aquaman"" earned back its budget three-fold with a worldwide take of over a billion dollars! The undersea vistas as well as the exotic creatures lure in the forbidden depths of the trench that challenge both Atlanna and our hero are as extraordinary looking as the scenery is stunning. The cast that includes luminaries like Dolph Lundgren, Michael Beach as Manta's father, Randall Park, and the voice of Julie Andrews as Karathen provide robust support for the Indeed, James Wan and his school of executive producers, including Peter Safran, Deborah and Zack Synder, Walter Hamada, DC Comics' own Geoff Johns, and Jon Berg, deserve kudos for their accomplishments. One of my favorite scenes takes place in a bar when Arthur and his father are guzzling beer. A group of pugnacious hooligans approach our hero with what appears to be sinister intentions, but they turn out for happy campers who only want to take a selfie of themselves with Arthur. The montage of photos is hilarious as well as refreshing in what might have degenerated into just another cliched barroom brawl."
Aquaman (2018),"Visually amazing, along with a fun, comedic and adventurous tone.","I really like Aquaman, I wasn't sure what to expect from it beforehand but the trailers looked cool and after watching it I had a smile on my face. Patrick Wilson as Orm is my favorite part of this film, he really captured the character flawlessly, and his Ocean Master costume was perfect. All the costumes in this film were amazing, along with the visual effects, the world building, and of course the trident's or quindents. This film in my opinion has a great mix of heart, humor and adventure, all though admittingly some of the dialogue does make me cringe at times. Like when Arthur meets the Daroca or however it's spelled. The score was incredible all the way through, it reminded me of Tron at times, and I'm a big fan of that. The action was amazing, the final fight is one of my favorites; even through Arthur breaking Orm's trident the way he does doesn't sit as well with me as when Orm breaks Arthur's. Amber Heard as Mera is pretty good, Black Manta is very well cast, King Nerious was cool; and the plot was simple and well focused; it helps when time limits are not applied!! I'm looking at you WB. A billion dollar title well deserved, liked it so much I went and saw it twice in the cinema's. Had a good smile both times."
Aquaman (2018),One of the Best comic book accurate suits,"Enjoyable movie all around. Has well timed music good for a laugh. ""Jason Mimoa is great"" - ethen. The biggest of haters is a lover of this movie. Now to get serious. We all can agree that Amber Heard pooped in a bed. Not just any bed but the king of the pirates Jack D. Sparrows bed. But she's attractive and does good to be a bad banana in this movie. So we can look past this stinky incident. Whales are cool, riding horses is cool sometimes, so riding whales is pretty epic. Definitely do not netflix and chill with this movie because the only action happening in that room is the epic under water fights. Peace love and happiness my two legged friends."
Aquaman (2018),Just a really fun comic book movie,"It is 1985 in Maine, during a massive storm, lighthouse keeper Thomas Curry rescues Atlanna, Queen of Atlantis. They fall in love and have a son, Arthur. Thus their son becomes the rightful heir to the throne of Atlantis. But their happy life ends when the King of Atlantis sends his warriors to retrieve Atlanna, his arranged bride. So, to save her family, Atlanna returns to Atlantis. Now Arthur is grown and has become the hero Aquaman, guarding the oceans and rescuing ships from storms and pirates. But there is a new threat on the ocean that may destroy the surface world.... He is Orm, the wicked ruler of Atlantis and Arthur's half-brother. Orm plans to rule the Ocean and the Land. ""A war is coming to the surface whether you like or not. And I am bringing the wrath of the Seven Seas with me"" - Orm
Now in order to stop his brother, save Atlantis and the entire earth, Aquaman must find and retrieve the Trident and become the rightful heir to the throne. ""In this Trident resides the power of Atlantis. In the wrong hands, it would bring destruction. In the hands of the true heir, it will unite all our kingdoms above and below""- King Atlan
Aquaman is based on the DC Comics superhero. I grew up reading those comic books and my expectations were very high.... And Wow! Jason Momo is a Awesome Aquaman. The story is pretty good, full of action, and boosted by an excellent cast. Nothing really spectacular, just a really fun comic book movie. Cast - Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Temuera Morrison, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Graham McTavish."
Aquaman (2018),Surprisingly Good Movie to Come Out of the DCEU,"Aqua Man is definitely a top tier DCEU movie. It easily one of the best two DCEU movies along with the first Shazam. It takes place after Justice League, though you don't need to watch Justice League to have a deep understanding of Aqua Man with an exception of one reference that can be easily be blown off. The visuals are phenomenal and the story is good. The story is about going out and fighting for what you think is right, even if you don't think you're worthy enough. All I have to complain about the story is that the ending could feel a little rushed. I feel like the story does an alright job at setting up a sequel. I am definitely hyped up for the Lost Kingdom. It is the only DCEU movie to earn a billion dollars in the box office and it definitely deserves it. I don't feel like it deserves all the bad reviews I immediately see when going to the reviews section."
Aquaman (2018),"Although the movie is a bit long, it has a relatively fast flow.","Despite its long duration, the film can be said to flow relatively quickly and without getting too boring. I'm not much of a follower of DC and Marvel productions, but this movie was one of the ones I found good. I thought the underwater scenes were impressive. Even though the story is not very effective, the movie is somehow watchable. I can say that there is no memorable, interesting character other than Aquaman. If we look carefully, of course there are shortcomings. There's a bit of a lack of emotion. Although the action is not very high compared to the duration of the movie, it can be said that the flow is good. The plots of most superhero movies are usually boring. It could have been done differently or the characters could have been analyzed better. In short, more meaningful touches can be added to such productions instead of adding a simple action show."
Aquaman (2018),A Real Queenslander of a Superhero Film,"This is an exceptional DC film for everyone to watch. I do not understand why all the negativity. I live in Queensland, and I can say that Queensland was an excellent location to create this film. The storyline was elegant and strong. The cast selection was absolutely terrific. They committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. Jason Momoa was not exactly the perfect selection for the lead role but he was still able to deliver. Nicole Kidman really sold it in this film. She is phenomenal in every role she plays. This film teaches viewers everything about bravery and strength. My life does not have any. This is a remarkable Queensland DC film for all viewers to watch and enjoy."
Aquaman (2018),Stunning Visuals !!,"""Aquaman"" is a visually stunning and action-packed superhero movie that plunges viewers into a mesmerizing underwater world. With its breathtaking underwater sequences, charismatic performances, and a storyline that explores Arthur Curry's journey to embracing his destiny as a hero and king, the film is a thrilling ride from start to finish. Jason Momoa's portrayal of Aquaman adds charisma and depth to the character, making him relatable and endearing. ""Aquaman"" is a triumph in the superhero genre, offering a fresh and exciting take on the classic DC Comics character. Must watch for DC fans !"
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),A Perfect Film to Watch.,This is my all time favorite film. I really love how its a visual treat for all the Viewers with a great Storyline and different approach to the film makes it even more interesting. Thank you makers for a film like this. Its so crazily edited and Visual effects is so seamless. The characters have given justice and I don't think any film is going to be made like this in the next 20 years. I am a filmmaker myself and would really love to be a part of any other projects the directors are making. I am looking forward to what they have in their minds to show the world. It has a great Background score and Its Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan's finest.
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Not much, no place, for nearly 2.5 hours","While a visual and action spectacle, the title is absolutely correct: this film really is everywhere all at once, and not in a good way. It's all over the map and I grew weary between its rapid-fire presentation and confusing and constantly shifting themes that made a lot of noise but did very little to offer any real explanations as to why all this was happening. Most of the film revolves around the main character, Evelyn, who is ripped out of her normal humdrum existence and tapped to be some sort of ""Neo""(The Matrix) style character who must save the ""alpha-verse"" from certain destruction by evil forces, and so on. The film goes to considerable lengths to explain the dynamics of this metaverse, it's odd gadgets, navigation and parallels to our own universe, and we follow along as Evelyn learns how to navigate its bizarre eccentricities and survive various threats. Yet in the final act of the film, nearly all of it is made irrelevant, and messages about positivity and family bonding are substituted instead. The journey Evelyn undertakes to reach these (in my opinion) rather pedestrian realizations is so convoluted and built up, I think the ""it was all a dream"" ending might have actually worked here. Alice really goes down the rabbit hole and after all she sees and experiences, she realizes she doesn't have to live up to her father's expectations, her daughter being gay is fine, and her husband isn't a fool just because he has a positive outlook. Maybe try a therapist next time? 5/10, bumped to a 6 for slick presentation, humor and some fun action."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),Wow,"I watched this film at a very low point in my life when I was searching for a purpose. I had goals and ambition, however, all of the potential outcomes of my life seemed to fall short of what I thought I wanted. My partner (who I watched this with) had been spending some time trying to convince me that it was not just WHAT I do with my life, but how and who I do it with. This answer did not satisfy me at the time. Until watching this film. I suddenly felt this enormous amount of guilt and shame for keeping my head in the clouds instead of on the people around me. This film is astonishing at creating spectacle without drawing away your attention from the complexities the characters touch. I highly recommend it."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Clearly the ""Drive"" of that year's Oscars. Won't stand the test of time either.","On paper, this film is ideally suited to my tastes: fantasy/sci-fi with a multi-dimensional plot and I expected so much given all of the awards and Oscars. Well, I was badly disappointed and forced myself to watch it despite wanting to give up as the expectation of something marvellous spanning dimensions, time and space never actually materialised. Instead, most of it is flashes of alternate scenes whilst a large part takes place in an office block. If the seriousness surrounding the Oscars had hinted at all that it was a cheesy farce, I perhaps wouldn't have been so disappointed but it is truly slapstick comedy and only vaguely funny. It isn't even Sci-fi but more of a fantasy akin to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, just not as dry or self-effacing enough to be very funny. There are funny moments and crass ones too, daft scenes also, but more than anything, there is a lot of noise and silliness as the mother, Evelyne, has to do stupid things in order to jump between universes, picking up skills from other lives along the way. Although those skills are questionable as are the fight scenes and they weren't able to make those convincing at all so should have made them more comedic. It seems that this is a hit due to hype rather than much discerning truth about the actual quality of the film and story. Reminds me of Drive, another poor movie which swept the Oscars and which not many probably remember. This too won't stand up as one of the great movies of the last few years and that is precisely what we should expect from a film that sweeps the board at the Oscars. I'm sure most of us can think of notable examples, of which this is not one."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),Visually Stunning But Overly Weird And Can't Get Behind The Message Of The Movie,"Everything Everywhere All At Once had me intrigued from the first trailer. Adding to that was the Oscar buzz that surrounded the movie, from its various nominations to its major wins - including Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor/Actress, and Best Picture. I finally sat down and watched it the other day, and despite being impressed by the visuals of the movie, I was left feeling a little underwhelmed, both by the movie's over-obsession with being weird and its message of positive nihilism. The performances are pretty good. Michelle Yeoh and Ye Huy Quan definitely earned their Oscar wins in here, delivering really great performances. Jamie Lee Curtis was fine in the role, but I don't necessarily think she shined over some other nominations from the Oscars that year (Angela Bassett, anyone?). Stephanie Hsu is good in her respective role as well. Visually the movie does have plenty of interesting cinematography. There's good use of color and editing, especially in sequences where Michelle Yeoh is passing through multiple multiverses. There's definitely a lot of creativity on display here. However, at the same time, I felt like some of the creative choices were a little too weird and out of place - there for being weird and nothing else. A character fights someone with two dildos seemingly out of nowhere, the everything bagel thing, a man shoves a trophy shaped like a sex toy up his butt, etc. There's just some weird stuff that just is there for the sake of being weird, and it takes me out of the movie. On top of that, what drags this movie down for me is its message. Essentially what this movie comes down to is that, nothing matters in the vast universe, so you can make your life and existence anything you want it to be and that gives it meaning. As a Christian, I don't agree with this: I believe there is a purpose and there is meaning in our lives, and that there's no way to justify morality, good, and kindness apart from God's standard. I believe the message the movie gives across is a little dangerous, as what is good to one person will be evil to another. At the end of the day, this is a well-made movie, and I do think there's a lot of creativity on display. I appreciate directors going out and making something that is completely their vision. However, at the same time, I do think they went overboard with the strangeness of the concept, and I don't agree with the message the movie tries to give off. That all being said, give Raccooconie his own movie. That animatronic raccoon deserved an Oscar."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),Fade to Black,"We're told we mean nothing and are just existing until we fade into black. Was this movie made to take away whatever hope we had? Is it supposed to reveal the deep truth that we mean nothing and we're just supposed to say ""ok""? This movie has no deep message, it's just a big lie that you and me are specks in a void of nothing. Does it only take good acting, vfx, and fight scenes to make us believe there's no hope? We're all falling, you can either cry and find the sudden stop or grab the hand reaching out to you and accept It's help. Don't believe the lies you're being told. You matter. Everything Everywhere all at Once."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Cheesy it may be, love is the ultimate answer","I had no way to enjoy watching this overwhelming film and had a headache the first time I watched it. I even had difficulty in sorting the storyline out from tons of information. Though I got key elements from this artwork: nihilism and love. It's much more easier and enjoyable when I quickly went through this film one year later. It's a great application of the multiverse concept originally from quantum physics to Sci-Fi, with welled handed combination of philosophy and hilarious entertainment. This story happened in one day, which reminds me of Ulysses from James Joyce. Loser Evelyn is busy with messy life. The business is facing the brink of failure while taking care of judgmental father in-law and without being aware that weak and stupid husband Waymond wants to get divorced. And rebellious daughter Joy is a lesbian. Technical details don't matter anymore. Let's focus on essential ideas. Every tiny decision creates another branching universe, resulting in infinite multiverse. Look back, she run away with current nerdy husband, breaking with families. If you are pushed beyond limit, your fracturing mind experiences every world every possibility at the same time. What will happen if you know everything is just a random rearrangement, a statistical inevitability, and you are nothing special. Nothing gives you meaning. There is no objective truth anymore, you will be free from any morality and guilty. Because nothing matters. That's how Jobu Tupaki is trapped by nihilism and why builds a Bagel, for eliminating herself. The Bagel without core is the image of darkness in nihilism, no love. When Evelyn gets mind fracturing on the way to save her daughter, she jumps into different universe and experiences different life. It is fun to see such creative and funny different possibilities, cookie/small finger is Kung Fu, Hot dog finger...... She could have been a Kung Fu start, a chef, an artist... It seems her current life is the most worst one who never fulfills goals. However, in fact every life is as same terrible as others. You lose your freedom if you are a star. It's just trade off. It's always ridiculous and terrible. She is attempted to join Jobu Tupaki for disappearing forever. In last minute, she is stopped and convinced by naive husband, who gives the ultimate answer: the only thing to resist nihilism is love. Being kind, that's the key to meaning. With love, every universe is as good as this one. She has the pattern of eye with a pupil is love to cancel nihilism. One ambitious book tried to capture everything in one day. Overall it's a good movie, but I don't like the rock conversation, which is obviously preaching. There will be better ways to present those ideas. It's interesting to discuss why Evelyn and her daughter Joy (people) have different choices when facing nihilism. Is it because Evelyn has experienced love and her daughter not really? Is romantic love the only tool to defeat nihilism? What about families and friendship? Last but not least, the answer is not fully given, how to practice kindness? Why some are so kind and some are not? How big is the role of genetics?"
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),Now THERE's a Movie!,"As humanity moves forward towards becoming what Gary Zukav would call multi-sensory beings, we collectively sense that our laboratories and other traditional perceptions of reality
are increasingly outmoded. This movie bravely takes that on, and against all odds, succeeds. What to believe in when our traditional values and science just seem to lead us to trash the planet and ourselves with it? As our heroine moves from one multi-verse reality to another, for a brief moment it appears that the traditional definition of success - fame and fortune - is what winning means, even across multple realities. Then he say to her, in his fancy tux, ""I would have loved to run a coin laundry in another life -- with you."" And suddenly we are anchored, and we know what it is all for, the confusion and the fighting. As anyone who looks in at a loved one, even an annoying one, at the end of an long exhausting day, we know what its all for. True that! Michelle Yeoh is a bad--ss, the artistry of her discipline is breath-taking. Amazing."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),The Matrix Meets Pulp Fiction Meets La La Land.,"Have not been this disappointed in a movie in along time . I made myself sit through the whole thing so folks couldn't say I missed something by not seeing it through. I gave it two stars because of the brilliant acting. Otherwise it would have been 1. I actually got the point of the movie and saw what they were trying to do. But it just seemed to be written by teenage boys who grew up watching Kung Fu Movies. The Scenes with the Movie Star and her husband along with the Mom and daughter in the parking towards the end of the movie were outstanding. However the scenes with the butt plugs and the dildo were too much. Childish and silly. And the rocks talking to each other , really? The moment where one of the characters asked if they could just stop fighting really resonated with me. I thought to myself. Yes please. We got the point 30 minutes into the film. All the fighting represented the personal conflict in her life. We don't need another hour of this. I read a review where someone said maybe this is what Tik Tok has done to our brains. Maybe that would explain why anyone would vote this Best Picture Maybe if I were a Kung Fu fan I would ahev enjoyed the movie more. I wanted to see the movie about the Hollywood star . I wanted to see the movie about the Mother and Daughter crying in the parking lot. I didn't want to see hot dog hands and people trying to kill each other every five minutes . Too each his own. I need to watch a real movie to get this out of my brain."
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),Pulp Fiction Meets Matrix Meets La La Land.,I gave it a second star because the acting was very good. Other than that the movie is close to being my least favorite movie ever. It makes me sad to think people thinks this is brilliant. I actually got the premise of the movie but it made me think of how teenage boys see the world. The Kung Fu fighting became monotonous and boring. I got that it represented the personal conflict in her real life. The scenes toward the end where they argued and shared and cried showed that. But sitting through two rocks talking to each other and the butt plug scene were just too much. I made myself sit through the whole thing so people who like this film couldn't say that I would have liked it if I had seen the whole thing. If I had watched it in the theater I probably would have walked out at the butt plug scene. I know people think this is incredibly creative but again it was just silly and childish. I am sure if I were a fan of Kung Fu movies I might have appreciated the movie more. But still that scene and the dildo scene just made me think that adolescents had written the movie. No offense to adolescents. The line where one of the main characters said can we please stop fighting resonated with me. I thought to myself yes please stop fighting. We got the point after the first 30 minutes of fighting. The scenes with the movie star and her husband and the mother and daughter in the parking lot were brilliant. So much of the rest of the movie was just insulting and childish. I struggled through this more out of curiosity than anything else. Now I need to watch something else to try and forget how annoying and disappointing this movie was for me.
Interstellar (2014),Mind-bending,"I am a Christopher Nolan fan by heart, though at the time of watching this film, I had only known of his work with respect to the 'Dark Knight' franchise. But after years of everyone around me telling me that 'Interstellar' is Nolan's masterpiece, I finally gave in. I will admit that the film does not leap out of the gates with intriguing premises, but it is instead a slow-rolling boulder of film that by the end has your jaw hanging as you attempt to wrap your mind around these concepts. I still could not tell you exactly what happens, but this film transcends scientific understanding and instead lets the decisions characters make speak for themselves. A true Nolan twist."
Interstellar (2014),"Hands down, best film ever created.","Almost a decade later, I still frequently come back to fragments of the film. Especially the soundtrack, to find inspiration, to broaden my mind and understanding of things, to fuel my passion for learning when I study, to just appreciate the beauty of the universe and everything in it and of course, the beauty of film making. I appreciate every intricate piece of detail and latent content hidden and showcased in this film. From the ticking on Miller's planet to Brand and Copper's conversation about love, and how it traces back to Cooper and Grandpa's conversation on Earth. The film is not only about the wonders of science, the general relativity of space time or the existence of 5 dimensional beings or higher life forms referred to as 'they' but also about love, dreams, passion, gratification, achieving greatness, emotions and human connection at its very core. Like Brand mentions Love is the only thing we can perceive that transcends space time, a mysterious source of energy, a phenomenon we cannot understand but only feel, something that drives us to surpass our limits, the film depicts that incredibly well. Cooper leaves for space out of passion not purely for humanity's sake, Murph comes back to search for the truth only out of her love for her father, Brand travels to Edmund's planet purely out of love. The space is the canvas and love is the paint, and Nolan and his crew has painted a marvelous piece of artwork. One of my biggest regrets is not watching this film at the the theaters when it first came out. I was too little then."
Interstellar (2014),"Interstellar: Nolan's Cosmic Odyssey Earns an 8/10 for Visual Spectacle, Emotional Depth, and a Journey Beyond the Stars.","Interstellar, a solid 8, man! Christopher Nolan's space odyssey is mind-bending with those epic visuals and a killer soundtrack. Matthew McConaughey's journey through space and time is like a cosmic rollercoaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The science stuff might get a bit complicated, but who cares when you've got black holes, time dilation, and those heart-wrenching moments? The emotional punches hit you harder than a gravitational pull. The whole survival-of-humanity thing mixed with family drama adds a layer of intensity that's both thrilling and tear-jerking. And that soundtrack? Hans Zimmer nails it, making every scene feel like an epic space opera. Sure, it's not a flawless 10 because some parts might be a tad confusing, but that's the Nolan touch. 'Interstellar' is like a trip through the cosmos that leaves you questioning the universe and your existence. An 8/10 because, despite its complexities, it's a space epic that captures the awe of the unknown and the power of human determination - a must-watch for anyone with a love for the stars."
Interstellar (2014),"All in all, phenomenal!","What a cracker! So glad to finally tick 'Interstellar' off my theoretical list, took me far too long to get around to it but boy am I glad I finally have done - sensational film! The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here I'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning. Matthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway. I will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) 'Everything Everywhere All at Once', for example. In short: just a nit-pick, tbh. All in all, phenomenal!"
Interstellar (2014),It looks good,"This film is another of an increasing number of films with so many 10 out of 10 reviews, that I am left incredulous when I finally get to see it. It's great to look at, once we get into space, and the story is interesting but it's also too long, the sound is dreadful (whisper whisper whisper, murmur mumble murmur, LOUD LOUD LOUD!) and the script writing is at times so Scooby Doo that it becomes a cringe to watch. There are also too few characters, such that some seem over used, in roles which would be better split, were the script to remain plausible. And overall, it's the script that is poor, not the story. I was so disappointed. Apart from the visuals, this film is nowhere near being one of the best, and the best of this genre remains 2001: A Space Odyssey."
Interstellar (2014),most incredible film ever,"I've watched this film over 20 times, 10/10 acting 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 casting 10/10 filming. Makes you think hard about what's out there. Easily my favourite film of all time, Christopher Nolan did an amazing job of directing it and the cast did an incredible amount of work by the looks of it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a complex and engaging movie and to anyone who is interested in science and space exploration. It is great for all ages but i did need to watch it a few times to fully understand it. The soundtrack is a big part of this film and was composed perfectly not only adding suspense and also has a signature sound to it. Overall i think this film was incredible 10/10."
Interstellar (2014),really intriguing,"Had a hard time on starting this movie for some reasons but once i was hooked i could not get my eyes off of the movie despite of how sleepy i was because admit it, the movie was so lengthy and it had some maybe dull moments but not really boring maybe this is just me but pace was slow which is not up to my preferences. However a good movie still because visuals overall, so spectacular i would love to see this on a big screen. All that science stuff, confusing that's when i was sleepy my braincells weren't ready for this movie. But i still loved it! There's just a lot to it plus the emotions were so greatly portrayed it was moving and the ending? I loved it so much. I would rate this higher if i were smarter and was able to understand the sci-fi things going on but that's totally on me and not the movie."
Interstellar (2014),I'm sorry. Dumb.,"If you have any idea how physics works and how space work, most of this movie is pretty hard to believe. I understand movies like Star Wars, which are set in the future, and where the premise is that you have to suspend all of your knowledge about how science works to enjoy the movie. But this movie was set near present day, and the premise of the movie was different than other movies like Star Wars Flying in and out of black holes and flying through wormholes was just a bit too hard for me to get my arms around so that kind of ruined the whole movie. I also found it a little bit too overdramatic."
Interstellar (2014),The IMAX Experience,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delivers a heart-touching, enthusiastic, and mind-blowing IMAX experience. With breathtaking visuals and a gripping storyline, it explores the boundless dimensions of space, evoking deep emotions while challenging the intellect. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing score, creates a symphony of sensations that lingers long after the credits roll. A journey beyond the stars, ""Interstellar"" is an immersive exploration of love, time, and the uncharted mysteries of the universe, leaving audiences awe-inspired in its wake."
Interstellar (2014),Dull and Absurd,"The positives: It's beautifully photographed and the depiction of the wormhole is spectacular. Performances are delivered with conviction - Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are particularly effective. The negatives: It's very long - not necessarily a problem - but if you make a 3 hour movie it has to sustain interest (and in this case tension) for that period, which, unfortunately, it doesn't. 2 hours in, I really didn't care if mankind survived. Not helped by Mathew McConaughey's slow, mumbled delivery. I guess he was going for intensity, but it doesn't come across that way. The absurdity: The robots are ridiculous - like something out of a 60s Sci-fi serial. The idea that a more advanced society would create something like that is just plain ludicrous. And the depiction of the inside of a black hole and how it helps solve the puzzle is unbelievable in the extreme. To me, it seems like Nolan had no idea how to solve the dilemma he had set. Sure, it's Sci-fi, but unless it's done for comic effect, it still needs at least a veneer of plausibility. But not here. One of those films that has an over-inflated rating and reputation, which may well be revised by posterity."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),"Bonds, love, family, environment, diversity","This film continues to maintain the essence of Guardians, for example the humor, the music, its objective of the non-blood family bond. This film covers the theme of ties, of the family, with a great environmental message, representing it in a real way. It is also a criticism of those who go against diversity. It gives a good closure to the trilogy but leaves the door open for the story to continue. It is a film where one laughs and cries. It really is one of the best late-stage marvel movies, with better effect than others. This movie really makes you make a connection with its characters, we feel their emotions, I like that they told us more about Rocket's story."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),Guardians of the Galaxy,"There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians. I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot. The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment. At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),Marvel Movies Continue to Excite,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 blasts off with laughter, tears, and cosmic chaos! Buckle up for Gunn's emotional farewell filled with Rocket's poignant journey, Drax and Mantis's hilarious bromance, killer tunes, breathtaking visuals, and Guardians banter sharper than ever. This bittersweet love letter to the Misfits is a family story about growth, redemption, and embracing the future. Whether you're a longtime fan or a spacefaring newbie, crank up the tunes and prepare to be blown away. Don't miss this epic mission! Enjoy this movie is you are long standing fan for marvel movies very good...."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),I don't understand the hype,"You have to be either a child or someone who does not understand the depth of our world to enjoy this movie. Mindless brain rot desperately trying to make you feel something. I love marvel I really do. And if you care about these characters I get it. But you've got to take off those rose colored glasses and understand that the billionaires controlling these movies don't care. It's obvious how shallow and insignificant everything they write for these movies is. No more in any marvel movie is there a sense of danger or achievement or anything of that regard. Not so long as the multiverse exists. And this could have been fixed probably if the producers cared enough to address it, which they don't. Shallow, synthetic, and unapologetically pulling your heart strings to distract you from the lack of substance or anything of any meaning. Even the action scenes which previously have distracted the masses from the glaring blandness and dullness are derivative and uniquely boring to watch. No artistic creativity, offers nothing new and is an insult to the comic universe."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),What a waste of time and money,"Nothing cool or original. Seems as if Gunn did this wasted and for a paycheck. What an awful way to send off a Great franchise. Leaning on all the things that made this arc cool, yet reducing it to a cheap quick payoff. No wonder Marvel is failing and this is a perfect example. What tripe. I felt nothing from this, mote like cheated from the greatness it once was. What an utter disappointment. There was nothing to feel here. Just like this review saying it's too short but, I have nothing more to say for this waste of space wannabe so, I have to write more when I don't want to waste anymore of my time."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),"Good, but a somewhat distant third","This was a good movie. The scenes with Rocket and his first friends were heart wrenching. The action scenes were amazing. The end result of the movie tied up character arcs for some of them perfectly enough that there story ends with this movie, but it leaves open chances for return for others. Rocket's backstory is well told and interesting. The character growth for a few of then is beautiful. Yet...yet...this movie was underwhelming as a whole. I think it felt a bit rushed and hectic. Yes, the first two had a lot going on as well, but you didn't get the feeling they were a runaway train at any point. This one felt like it was hurtling out of control with no explanation. The plot takes off at 100 mph and never slows down, but parts if it also have little to no explanation. This is a good movie, but it doesn't quite have the charm, plot, or music of the first two. I would 100% pay for a fourth and beyond and will certainly miss The Guardians as currently constructed inside the MCU."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),Like talking to a bigoted grandparent...,"...this film is emotionally exhausting and utterly unsatisfying. The characters, flattened into two-dimensional self-parodies, are permitted one of two emotional states: mawkish sentimentality, or incongruous fury. Flipping between these extreme emotions from scene to scene - and sometimes within a scene - the cast spends the entire film either weeping or yelling at each other. With no dynamic range, there is little room for story arc, though since the plot can be summarised in five words - 'Rocket's creator wants him back' - perhaps that's no bad thing; and no room at all for character development. The result is so bizarre you'd be forgiven for thinking that James Gunn had wandered off set and let an angry adolescent do the directing."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),"""We'll all fly away together, one last time, into the forever and beautiful sky.""","FILM: 8.5/10. Embarking on my rewatch of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, I'm thrilled to report that this cosmic adventure is nothing short of an absolute blast. Director James Gunn has once again worked his magic, delivering a perfect concoction of heart, humour, and intergalactic action that defines the franchise. From the opening scene to the final credits, the film is a wild ride that never loses momentum. Rocket, voiced by the impeccable Bradley Cooper, takes center stage with a story arc that adds surprising emotional depth to this already beloved character. Gunn explores Rocket's inner struggles, making audiences feel for this CGI raccoon more than some flesh-and-blood beings. Visually, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a spectacle. The cosmic landscapes burst with vibrant colours, immersing the audience in a mesmerizing universe filled with strange creatures and breathtaking locales. The action sequences, whether in space or on solid ground, are a visual feast that effortlessly combines thrilling combat with the trademark humor of the Guardians. The chemistry among the cast remains as potent as ever. The familiar faces - Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Karen Gillan - effortlessly slide back into their roles, infusing each character with their unique charm. The introduction of new characters breathes fresh dynamics into the team, enriching the overarching narrative. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 strikes a perfect balance in storytelling, seamlessly blending lighthearted comedy with poignant character development. Themes of family, redemption, and sacrifice are expertly woven into a narrative that keeps you engaged and emotionally invested. While some may find certain sequences, particularly those involving Rocket, a tad gratuitous given Marvel's family-friendly approach, the film remains a gripping and impactful experience. So, strap in, hold on tight, and enjoy this final interstellar joyride with the Guardians that hits all the right notes. FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray VIDEO: 10/10.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),One of the best films of the new phase for Marvel.,"Guardians Vol. 3 delivers what many newer Marvel movies have been lacking of late. Granted, we are presented with characters which we have grown to love so that puts this film at an advantage. However, the most recent installment added to character's depth and continued on storylines created in the previous phase. For this reason, Guardians Vol. 3 stands as one of Marvel's better films. The most striking thing to me is the emotion and feeling the animators and Bradley Cooper were able to bring to a CGI character like Rocket. Honestly one of the more moving performances I've ever seen from voice acting and animation alone. The film left me satisfied as a conclusion to this three-part story. As usual with this franchise, the soundtrack was phenomenal. The comedic performances and the action sequences were all on par with the previous films as well. Some newer characters (Adam Warlock) felt underwhelming but this didn't take away from the overall story. In fact, I loved Poulter's performance and found it quite funny, but the character himself felt unnecessary in the overall story. The villain, The High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji, was one of my favorite villains in the MCU to date. Overall, this film should be a delight to anyone who has grown to love the Guardians franchise. If you're not into the MCU films then this probably won't change your view. Otherwise, you will be happy to see the familiar faces and a film that lives up to the high bar that Marvel has set for itself, something a lot of the newer films have failed to do."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023),Fast and fun or dark and serious? A confused movie,"What distinguishes this movie from the previous two is that it has a darker side to it, relating to Rocket's backstory. This is at the same time the movie's strength and weakness. This story can get in your feels at moments, but on the other hand the reasons for why things happen remain in shadows. The psychology behind the Bad Guy's actions is not a point of focus. And that doesn't make him mysterious. It makes him shallow and uninteresting: The only thing he seems to be capable of is being angry. You could say, just sit and watch the wild ride and enjoy. But the action itself is somewhat generic and the story rather straightforward. And this time the music and the jokes do not bring this movie to a higher level. The music sometimes felt out of place. The jokes were crammed in because a certain number of jokes had to be in the movie, or so I guess. For a two and a half hour movie the story is simply not well developed enough to the point of being superficial. The interaction between the characters, the dialogue, it wasn't fresh. It didn't sparkle. More of the same. And what about those captive children? That looked so eery. And yet, it added virtually nothing to the story, because nothing was done with this fact. So you see the dark backstory gets flushed out by all the action scenes, making it almost a bit childish. The emotional moments were only there for effect.... No, this is not Star Wars where a perfect balance between fun & serious and dark & light was created. It's not a bad movie though. The visuals are outstanding, There's a lot of action. It has its moments. It' the Guardians with a twist, but that twist makes it less funny and entertaining than the previous movies. And it does not compensate for that in depth."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),"Watching for the second time, I remember...","I enjoyed the movie, but watching for the second time I saw there was one glaring flaw, and I'm not sure if it's the responsibility of the new director for this second film, or the actor. Jennifer Lawrence's over-acting (limited to 2 or 3 significant moments) doesn't maim the movie, but it certainly momentarily breaks the spell. First, as Katniss ascends the tube to the arena, Once (more than once?) when she's in the arena, and once more in the last couple of minutes of the film. We had the same kind of crazed in the latter seasons of Handmaid's Tale; one presumes the directors didn't have a robust imagination for alternatives than ""crazed expression #24"". It's as if the characters, contrary to most reasonable people I think, actually hadn't reached the point of not being surprised by anything that might occur, in spite of all that has occurred to date. Otherwise, a very good film, well done all-around."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),Impressive Sequel,"I think this movie offers it all. That may seem strange as I have only rated a 7 but in truth I'm not sure what I would've wanted, it might just be the fact that this movie is just another part of the story that it can't deliver everything. In my opinion it is much better than the first movie as my only real complaint from that one was that the hunger games action didn't really start until the last hour. Although this film had a similar set up, I found the build up to the return to the games was much more interesting and set up a brilliant and thrilling game. This film is clearly a major set up for a larger story but I am looking forward to watching more!"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),Extremely well done,"An enormous step up in storytelling & filmmaking. Frustratingly bleak & hopeless with great set design. Intense, mysterious, & emotional as the plot plays out. New cast is impossible not to love. .

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),"Much Faster, More Visceral, and More Intriguing","The First Hunger Games film did something special. It told a compelling Dystopian type story. This film took the best elements from the first film and REALLY expanded upon them. The first film introduced the idea of the games to us, but this film gave us the argument and philosophy of why the games existed in the first place. This film also did a great job with expanding the world of Panem and it's character storytelling. As far as character moments go, there were alot of great moments from both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. Both of them struggling with life after the Games, and how they deal with the
savagery they've witnessed while going through another round of even more savagery in this film. Both are at there peak in this film and continue to shine and grow. Shoutout to Donald Sutherland though. We definitly get to spend more time with him in this film and we really get to see more of what drives him to do what he does, and we get to see some really awesome moments between his character President Snow, and Katniss Everdeen. The imagery and cinematography I believe have really stepped up since the last movie. There were some really beautiful shots. And the music is even more of a standout in this one. Other than that, like I said before, the action is a lot more savage than previous, and definitely more faster paced in my opinion. The Choreography and the action scenes were done really well. I know people say that this film may be the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, but in my opinion, both the 1st and 2nd could be potentially tied for first in my mind. You can't g owrong with either."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),Terribly Well Made,"My biggest problem with the first film was its low production value look. Holy Blazes! Does this film absolutely crush it in terms of production value. Amazing effects. Fantastic sets. Great color and camera work. Did you know they used handheld imax cameras for this film? Absolutely fantastic! This movie is a visual feast. The hunger games team was obviouslyt alloted a fat ton of money! I mean come on! They won over Philip Seymour Hoffman, the absolute legend, what a great actor. He kills it in this film, and casts a great menacing shadow on this film. This film carries the same (if not more powerful) emotional levity that the first film has. Great story. Great characters. AMAZING SCORE. By gosh, James Newton Howard absolutely crushed this series film score. Some of his best work. A part of me wants to give this film a 9, its just so well done. These films continue to depict the struggle of Tyranny Order, Chaos, Revolution and Anarchy in a profound real way. I better walk away before i give this film a 9..."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),A superior sequel,"The first Hunger Games had some good ideas going for, and some things that made it stand out from typical young adult fantasy adventures, and it was an overall decent feature. This sequel, however, is vastly superior, and could be likened to The Empire Strikes Back to the original Star Wars. Not in quality, perhaps - but it does follow up on the original formula and turns it on its head, developing its characters in a more complex light, and is all around darker and higher on the stakes. The actors have really grown into their roles more, and Jennifer Lawrence in particular is stellar as a strong heroine. The effects and action set pices are also far superior in this compared to the original film. Overall, great sequel that elevates and already interestin formula in spectacular ways!"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),This one stands above the others.,"Fearing an uprising over Katniss and Peeta's success at The Hunger Games, he changed the rules for the upcoming 75th games, the pair are right back inside the deadly games, only this time, the competition is much tougher. With the release of the new film just around the corner, I wanted to revisit them all, my feelings haven't changed, I still think that this is the best of the lot so far, I think it's better than the original film. I think it's a little slow to start, the impression you get early on is that it's an in depth look at life for Katniss and Peeta after the games, but when the twist comes, the film really does open up. It's not overlong, I'm glad they didn't push it out any further. There are some exciting sequences, these games really do provide a few thrills. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss, her performance for me is superior to her previous one, she's excellent, as are Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland. Toby Jones, still doesn't work for me here. Best of the lot for me. 8/10."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),Amazing film best hunger games movie,"This movie was amazing and made the series more entertaining. The first movie of course it was good but it was a little boring compared to this one. This movie introduces many new characters enhancing the plot. The main characters have to get tangled up with characters such as Finnick and Johanna. They make the plot way more intresting, especially with Finnicks personality and how he interacts with Katniss and Peeta. This movie also builds up extremely well to the point of the next movie, mockingjay part 1. At first it just makes it seem like they're playing the games like normal and, yes it does start of with that for most of the movie. Then at the end you can see that it was all building up to throwing over the capital when Katniss is picked up semi unconscious by the crane. Amazing film definitely the best out of the movies."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),Like a Remake...,"Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second installment in The Hunger Games franchise, and so far, I'm not so excited. The only reason I watch these movies is to get ready for the upcoming one now in November. But about this one. Well, it was just ok. The plot is taking place just after part one, and things are starting to get out of control when Katniss Everdeen is changing the Hunger Games, and starts to make people mad. After that it goes a while and a new Hunger Games is out once again, with the same characters from part one. So honestly, nothing new was changed, just a new game. You know they are going to survive, because it's too predictable. Some new challenges but didn't impress too much. But I have to admit that part two was better made than the original one. The stunts were creative and well done. Great camera-work and epic angles, what gave this an extra cinematic experience. Entertaining for most time, so I give most points for that. They showed a bigger connection between the friend group in the games, but I wished some more character development form the main characters. I also wished they could show more of the world outside, because they haven't showed it so much yet. And the music. Well, The Hunger Games theme is fun to listen, but not for the thousand time. They could put more variety in the music score. The nostalgic and heroic theme was getting my out of control sometimes. But overall, this wasn't such a bad movie. It got some technical and historical problems that I would change, but at the same time it was very entertaining and good action included, with a pretty cool cliffhanger at the end! So if you liked the first one, then you should watch this one, too, but don't have high expectations."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013),The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) Changes that improved the franchise,"I consider the first film in The Hunger Games franchise to be very mediocre. The steering is one of the points that bothers me the most in the previous one. However, in this second film the screenwriters and director are different. This detail completely changed the quality of the sequel, making it far superior to its predecessor. Even though it's better, it's still nothing incredible and revolutionary. It's a generic film with interesting scenes, but in the end it doesn't become anything memorable. The first act is the most interesting moment and best explores this problematic system in the universe of The Hunger Games. After the first act, we enter again into a dull story that serves as an excuse to become yet another generic action film. There's nothing special about the film, but it manages to be fun at different times."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Theron just can't replace old Mel. Worthington should have left his metal gag on,"Awful. More time is spent developing the two dimensional EVIL of the tribe out to do in the lead proxies, then any kind of rationale based on the character or motives of the good guys. Why Worthington has his head imprisoned in a metal jaw, like a post apocolytic Hannibal Lector, is beyond me. No reason suffices. ""The dogs bark, but the Caravan continues."" Or, ""In the desert sun, every step that you take could be the final one And in the burning heat, hanging on the edge of destruction"" Could be replaced with ""What the F*** and Who cares anyway?"" The original Miller production absolutely required a crazed alpha male to center the drama, which was done brilliantly by Gibson in the three movies that were the blueprint for his billions, and Theron is a terrific actress, but she just can't carry this myth. Worthington, even blander then a young Affleck, should have left the gag on the entire movie, and the escalting flash fire brilliance of the first three movies drives right off the cliff with this awful sequel. How did Miller let this happen? Fast money. All that remains is the dust and sand kicked up by the original great movies."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Easily one of the best action movies ever made,"The pace that is sustained throughout this movie is insane. It's two hours of nearly endless action. Characters were flawless. One liners and outrageous scenes aplenty. Watched it in the theaters three times. There isn't a whole lot of CGI in this film, which makes the action scenes feel gritty and raw. This translates directly into what one thinks of when it comes to Mad Max. I really love the different colors that are created throughout all the difference scenes. Charlize Theron steals the show and does such a good job. Overall, this one is definitely a movie to own. That's saying something in this day and age."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Kemonbet Great Movie,"Great action movie. It really is a strange film. As Max, the craggy but full-lipped Tom Hardy doesn't look anything like Mel Gibson. It is Theron - or possibly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, playing a sultry breeder called Splendid - who is channelling the eerily beautiful Gibson from 1979, except that probably neither is pretty enough. Fury Road is almost a silent film in it way. Dialogue is at a minimum, and when Max says anything it is usually preceded by an eccentric rumbling, mumbling mmmm sound. He is impassive, to say the least: the nearest Tom Hardy's Mad Max comes to an emotional outburst is when Splendid does something very brave while hanging on to the side of the truck. Rating 9/10."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Was there a story here?,"I have to admit, after hearing positive things, and still a long time lover of Thunderdome, I sat down expecting... something, different, something else. While effects and visuals were seemingly spot on and no one gave a poor performance, I never once felt there was a through line story. The best I could see was a plot device to go from point a to b and then, because that was a wash, to turn around and do it all in reverse. I barely got to know this Max character. The Furiosa and Nux characters seemed to have more development. Color me baffled. If it weren't for the noise, and even sometimes when there was, paying attention to what little there was presented here took some real work."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),A true masterpiece of action adventure genre,"I don't know why the rating is below 9 . It is an outstanding movie in every aspects, whether it is the story, cinematography, costume design, action, dialogues, music, soundtrack . It will be one of the greatest movie of all time, for me it is a GOAT. I do hereby request all members to watch it, it doesn't matter what genre you would like to watch, but please do try this one. You'll enjoy every bit of the two hours. I am big fan of the dark knight but I'll place dark knight in no 2 position, first is madmax fury road. Today I watched trailer of Furiosia, the prequel to this. I hope will enjoy it on theaters.,coz I missed fury road in theaters."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Relentlessly demented,"I've always skipped over this title, until yesterday. WOW!!! This movie is one fun, funny, demented (that's the only word that comes to mind), when I think of the rock guitarist strapped to one of Immortan Joe's rigs in the chasing party. I was mildly taken aback when people were called called the wretched, then I looked up and laughed out loud when I looked up from my typing (Yup THEY ARE wretched). I had a perverse enjoyment seeing how the people upon the mountain lived and had a healthy glow, expressing milk, cultivating greens etc... This lent a movie the sense of the absurd. Witness meeeee! Watch this movie over and over again!"
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),GEORGE MILLER'S GENRE MASTERPIECE,"After some 30 years writer director George Miller brilliantly brings back to a new generation of moviegoers his iconic character of Mad Max, which was originally played by Mel Gibson in a breakout performance that made him an international superstar. Miller's new supercharged, visually stunning reboot is a punk-influenced dystopian vision with an angry feminist streak, it is also a non-stop relentless orgy of brutal violence, death, blood, automotive mayhem peppered with collisions and explosions, as well as unforgettable, adrenaline-pumping, kinetic action sequences that puts to shame every action blockbuster in recent memory! The plot concerns the revenge seeking desert nomad Max Rockatansky, played impressively by Tom Hardy who skillfully takes over the role from Gibson and proves to be a worthy successor. Max is roped into helping a one-armed, steely-eyed, badass female protagonist named Furiosa, played magnificently by Charlize Theron in a scene-stealing performance. She has escape with five young women from the clutches of Immortan Joe, a fearsome psychotic warlord who wears a teeth-bar mask, he is chillingly played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the sadistic villain ""Toecutter"" in the 1979 cult-classic original Mad Max. Joe with his army of murderous gonzo warriors and tricked-out vehicles race across the desert, he will stop at nothing to recover his female property and is totally hellbent on stopping them. Masterful direction by Miller, exceptional supporting performances by Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman, Nathan Joe, Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Gunting-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abby Lee, Courtney Eaton, but it's Charlize Theron's feminist freedom fighter that surprisingly steals this awesome film. Dazzling cinematography by John Seale, with extraordinary razor-sharp editing by Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel. The film has breathtaking stunt work. A cinematic work of jaw-dropping imagination and artistic craftsmanship, a total masterpiece. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture & Best Director: George Miller."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),A mentally disturbed Max takes a backseat to a politically correct story amidst top notch production design and action scenes,"When I watched ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" in the theater back in 2015, I was impressed by its production design and action sequences, but felt like everything else left something to be desired when compared to the original three and especially the first two movies. However, when I looked it up again on imdb.com and Wikipedia recently and saw it got overwhelmingly positive reactions, I started thinking maybe the reason I didn't like it as much when I first saw it could be attributed to my having been much younger when I watched the original films for the first time and my disappointment with Mel Gibson's absence, so I decided to see it again with a open mind. Unfortunately, though, I have to conclude that not only do I still feel the same way as I did in 2015, I actually noticed some things this time around that, the more I think about them, even made me start liking it less. ""Fury Road"" is a post-apocalyptic action movie, first and foremost and the good news is that its production design is absolutely top notch and the action sequences are pretty much as impressive as the ones in the second movie, which set the bar for every other car chase shot on film or digitally ever since. I didn't care for the CGI used in some scenes, but there's very little in ""Fury Road"" and, to be honest, I prefer the makers use computer generated crashes when possible rather than destroy real classic cars, so I can live with that. This brings me to my first problem with the film, though. In the first two movies, both the good and the bad guys drove extremely cool vehicles that they were completely crazy about: in the original film, Max had his black-on-black Interceptor, Goose his Kawasaki and even the ""regular"" Police cars looked good enough for car enthusiasts to have been building replicas of them for years. In part 2, the only truly cool looking vehicle driven by the good guys was the Interceptor but, although it eventually did get destroyed, it still had enough screen time to make every teenager who was even remotely interested in cars dream about owning one himself one day. By contrast, the Interceptor is only in ""Fury Road"" for about a minute when it gets rolled, stolen, converted, used to try to kill Max and eventually crashed by the bad guys and in total it has but a few minutes of screen time. Originally I wanted to watch this film with my stepson, who loved Tom Hardy in Venom and I was hoping it would have the same effect on him as ""The Road Warrior"" had on me and also get him excited about muscle cars. Having seen it again, though, I'm glad he didn't since he probably wouldn't even be interested in the first two afterwards. Allow me to explain: the original two movies were a car lover's dream to watch and their vehicles were as much characters in them as Max and the others, but in this latest installment, only the bad guys are car fanatics and they are part of some perverse V8 engine and fossil fuel worshipping cult. In fact, with the exception of Max, all of the men are presented as having some sick obsession with cars and seeing women as sex objects to be possessed and do with as they please. In ""The Road Warrior"" both the people living in the compound and the Humungus' gang consisted of men and women, so there seems to have been equality among the sexes, but in ""Fury Road"", apparently, only the men are responsible for the sorry state or the world and even revel in it while the women are trying to fix it. You can tell that this film is very much a product of its time: Max actually takes a backseat in his own movie and the real heroes and protagonists are a strong warrior woman, a feminist commune of elderly hippies riding motorcycles (out of necessity, not love, like the Goose, mind you) and a group of pregnant ladies who want to leave their possessive husband because they have come to realize ""they are not things."" If the movie would have come out half a decade later they'd probably have found a way to include the phrase ""me too"" in it somewhere. So whereas in the 70s and the 80s the Mad Max movies were a car lover's dream, in these politically correct times the message carried out by ""Fury Road"" seems to be: cars and their enthusiasts are mentally ill males who in their obsession have brought about the destruction of their bodies and planet, which can only be saved by women and children and the men's only hope at redemption is to help them do so. I read one review here of a fan who seems to dislike everything about ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" yet absolutely adored ""Fury Road"", but it seems strange to me how one can have such a dislike for the tribe of children in that movie, but is completely okay with those pregnant wives of Immortan Joe. At least in the third movie, an effort was made to try and figure out how kids who would have had to grow up in post-apocalyptic isolation with nothing but comic books, some pop culture and old View-Master pictures to learn from would behave, think and speak. Immortan Joe's wives are presented as holding the key to a better future, yet don't seem to have been able to form any deeper thoughts than to come to the conclusion that they don't like being treated as objects. As for Max, in the original movies he was basically an nice guy, who suffers a terrible loss when his wife, kid and, presumably, best friend all die at the hands of the Toecutter's gang after the law fails to take them off the streets, which causes him to decide to take matters into his own hands and take terrible revenge on them. Then a nuclear event takes place between the first two movies and Max, not having been able to get over the loss he suffered in the first movie, has become a loner trying to survive in a wasted world. However, even though he's lost some of his people's skills, he's still an (anti-) hero that as a younger viewer you could look up to, proof of which is how the Feral Kid behaves around him. But in ""Fury Road"", Max is not mad, as in angry for having his family and best friend taken from him, but as in insane. He's suffered some kind of mental trauma which is never fully explained, leaving him to see and hear things that aren't there and clearly is in need of psychological help, which, for obvious reasons, he's been left deprived of, causing him to hardly be able to function amongst other people. Although Mel Gibson's Max also isn't a hero in the conventional sense of the word, he's basically still an okay guy, who's become somewhat of a social outcast from having been alone for a long time and having had to survive in a very harsh world. He isn't always on his best behavior around other people, but there's nothing really mentally wrong with him and he is still someone you could look up to and as a kid or teenager dream of being like. The same can't be said of Tom Hardy's Max, though, who badly suffers from P. T. S. D. and only barely manages to hold it together. At first I was bummed that Mel Gibson wouldn't play him anymore, but now that I've seen the movie again, I'm actually glad he didn't since this isn't the Max I love and wanted to see more of and if this is how George Miller wants to portray him now, I'm glad it's another actor's job to do so. A different ""character"" that was not only underused but sadly completely missing is Australia. In the first two movies which took place in the post-apocalyptic world, the breathtakingly beautiful Australian landscapes were just as much a part and character of the films as Max and the others, but this time around I can't blame the makers for their absence. Apparently, it had been raining so much in the areas that the previous two movies were shot at that they wouldn't have been credible as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. I was happy to read the Furiosa prequel has been shot ""down under"" again, but, unfortunately, there was more Australiana missing from ""Fury Road"". With the exception of Hugh Keays-Byrne, none of the major characters are Australian and most of the accents used throughout the film are English and American. I commend George Miller for having brought him back to again play the lead villain, though. He does by far the best job of the main characters and, although Immortan Joe lacks the depth, philosophy and, dare I say it, charm of the Toecutter, he's the only actor I felt was able to recapture some of the same feel of the characters in the original films. Charlize Theron does an okay job as a warrior woman, but, in my opinion, falls short of what I think is Virginia Hey's perfect combination of beauty and toughness in ""The Road Warrior"". All in all, I feel like the Mad Max movies were at their best when they were still domestically produced low-budget Australian films and dealt with basic themes like friendship, love, loss, revenge or simply survival in a wasted world and didn't yet try to become mainstream blockbusters and present family friendly or politically correct values. Like I wrote at the beginning of this review, the action sequences and production design of ""Fury Road"" are wonderful, but everything else leaves some, or in certain cases even a lot, to be desired."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),One of the best action films in the last 20+ years,"It's been 8 years since I saw this film in the theaters and I can still vividly remember that overwhelming feeling of visceral euphoria. The film rarely gives you a pause to catch your breath. From beginning to end, it's engaging, breath taking, awe inspiring, and just an absolute feast for the eyes. Story wise, it's pretty straight forward. For a film like this, I don't need some brain twisting scenario to keep me engaged. One thing I really loved was the throw back to traditional FX. All the vehicles were real, all the driving was real, and it just looked so good. It was a travesty it didn't win the Oscar for best VFX. Do yourself a favor, find the biggest screen you can with the loudest sound system and watch this incredible film."
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Non stop crazy action adventure,"I liked Mad Max fury road very much. As a norwegian, the Norse religion elements were interesting, cool and relatable. The movie had everything except sex scenes, which is a good thing. There was great action, creativity, comedy (not tiresome), great acting, emotions, scenery and music. The bad guys are evil and animated and the goood guys equally well presented. There are twists in the story keeping us surprised, even though the action is almost non stop. Someone thought the Max actor didn't fit the character, but I disagree. I found him believable. Quiet, haunted, doing whatever it takes to survive, but clearly a good guy. Should you watch Mad Max Fury road? I think yes."
The Flash (I) (2023),Solid,"The things that I liked were that the cameos were INSANE. I just hope they don't use the whole multiverse storylines for everything though. Ezra Miller actually plays a good Flash. Grant Gustin is still better, though. Well, Ezra apologised. So, I forgive him. Michael Keaton as Batman was good. I liked all of his scenes. General Zod was scary. It's so cool and awesome that Michael Shannon returned to reprise his role. If they recasted him, well, it would make sense, because of Flashpoint, but who else could've played him? Sasha Calle was good as Supergirl. She was pretty awesome in the film, but she's never going to appear, which kind of tragic. George Clooney's cameo was pretty funny, and Barry's reaction was so priceless. His tooth fell out that he glued in earlier on in the movie. The things that I did not like was that that Ben Affleck wasn't credited for the film. The CGI is very weird, and I think that that was the aesthetic that they were going for. I wanted this movie to a 10/10. I wanted it to be my favourite movie of 2023, but the CGI really narrowed it down. The reveal for the villain could have been better. Post credits was kind of random and unnecessary. Not every movie needs a post credit scene. Final Scores:
Plot: 8/10. Pacing: 7/10. Cinematography: 6/10. Cameos: 8/10. Characters: 9/10. Costumes: 8/10. Acting: 9/10. Music: 8/10. Overall: 8/10. I really enjoyed this film. This one's a fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and I assume it's got a high audience score, then. I don't know, that seems to happen a lot with films on Rotten Tomatoes. Anyway, this film is amazing, and you should watch it."
The Flash (I) (2023),"Even with all the references, ""The Flash"" rarely excites. The battle scenes have few textures and the action is generic and poorly finished accordingly","The plot begins with a powerful action scene, in which Barry Allen-Flash (Ezra Miller) is called to help the victims of a terrorist attack in a hospital. While the opening sequence already manages to give us the tone of the film, it also serves as an impetus for us to understand Barry's true intentions and the traumas he has carried for a long time - given that his mother was murdered when he was just a child and that the father took the blame and now awaits a trial that doesn't seem to have a happy ending. It is from there that, moved by the brief spark of hope in restoring a family that was torn apart by a poorly explained tragedy, Barry moves through anguish and melancholy to go back in time and prevent his mother from dying. However, what he did not expect is that his benevolent actions would trigger a series of events foreshadowing the implosion of the multiverse. What would you do if you could go back in time is the maxim that governs the feature film directed by Andy Muschietti - and a question that has certainly crossed our minds. After all, we all make mistakes and feel responsible for having acted differently and fixed what was broken. Barry, in this way, discovers that he has an ability to return to the past, breaking fragile rules of space-time to ""change events"" and ensure the survival of the one he never forgot. Now, it is remarkable how the protagonist is enveloped by a vigilante blindness that makes him forget the butterfly effect - and that takes him on a tortuous journey of reparation and nostalgia. However, no matter how noble his intentions may have been, the plan backfires and he opens a timeline parallel to the one he belongs to, creating a perpendicular rift in the multiverse that predicts catastrophe. For those who watched the trailers and promotional teasers for The Flash, you will probably have few surprises throughout the 140 minutes of the feature film directed by Argentinean Andy Muschietti. From the main special appearances to the apotheotic moments, almost everything had been revealed by Warner-DC's marketing department in the advertising pieces. Which, let's face it, takes a lot of the fun and emotional impact out of scenes like Batman (Michael Keaton) saying his iconic line ""I am Batman"". Surprising moments are really rare, usually references to other incarnations of the publisher's main superheroes in cinema and television. The plot itself shows Barry surprising himself with his ability to navigate between temporal plots and landing in the past to try to change his lonely present of orphanhood (dead mother and imprisoned father). When going back in time, he comes across his 18-year-old version, still without the powers brought by an unlikely combination of chemical elements and lightning fallen from the sky. However, the protagonist did not imagine that this world would be different from his own in certain ways, with several variants and few familiar constants. Batman is a different person, Superman Kal-el has a different destiny, but Zod (Michael Shannon) continues to come to Earth to conquer it and revive his home, Krypton. The Barry of the past is the hero who is reluctant when faced with the call to adventure, but who proves his worth along the journey of maturity. The Barry of the present is the mentor who guides his younger version to learn, thereby demonstrating the ability to be more than Batman's boy wonder - the same dramatic curve as Peter Parker, who proved to be more than Batman's boy wonder of Iron Man. Absolutely everything revolves around these parallel and complementary journeys of the Barrys, but that doesn't make The Flash a serious film about feelings, traumas and adult sensations. In addition to personal controversies, Ezra Miller had proven in other works to be an actor with repertoire, something that in this new super production is only partially valued. An irritating and loud teenager, the Barry of the past gains space and constantly supplants the seriousness of the Barry of the present, who carries the character's tragic tones. Andy Muschietti chooses to give more time and importance to the comic content, thereby sabotaging items such as: the hero's sadness aspects, the obsolescence of Michael Keaton's Batman and the strong personality of Supergirl (Sasha Calle). No wonder, Batman and Supergirl are demoted to mere occasional colleagues. Batman is still valued for its nostalgic aspect, but Krypton's daughter is compromised by the suffocation of drama. In addition to this issue, the film is tonally very strange, with an initial sequence of frantic action in Gotham City that serves to make it very clear that the Flash in this film is the Flash from Justice League, complete with Jeremy Irons' Alfred and the Ben Affleck's Batman (albeit wearing an absolutely hideous version of his costume). At the beginning, the tone is openly comical, with Ezra Miller reveling in his dramatic limitations as a court jester, with the beating itself taking on a veneer that was supposed to be hilarious, but which ends up only generating yellow smiles due to the exaggeration of the whole thing, including a newborn rescue sequence in a hospital featuring horrific visual effects of these babies. Then, in the other universe, the footprint is opposite, darker and heavier, but also more rushed and without Muschietti, at any point, really having the courage to bet his chips on it, which leaves room for inconveniences of displaced humor that they detract from the whole and deflate the drama, especially because the development of the two Barry Allens, especially the youngest, is relegated to the background and then, almost instantly, is accelerated from 0 to 100 without giving time. Another problem that weighs heavily on ""The Flash"", especially in the final third of the projection, is the visual effects. And it's not just a standard complaint about hero films: the thing is bad even by the low standards that Marvel has been presenting lately. The opening sequence, with Flash saving falling babies, is terrible on a PlayStation 2 level and there are several racing scenes that all feel artificial and weightless. And it's something that really hinders the experience, as it takes away the impact of key moments. There are special appearances that are made entirely (and without purpose in certain cases) in CGI that look like rubber and wax dolls with which it is impossible to create any connection. What should be nerd apotheosis becomes just something shameful. Luckily for fans and spectators, Muschietti manages to balance the poverty of the effects with a firm pulse on the progress of the story. In the end, it is thanks to his direction that ""The Flash"" manages to deliver something that DC has never managed before: uncompromised and unpretentious fun. The rest of the film, especially its final minutes once again in the chronosphere, is a search for references and fan service that irritatingly has become the standard for blockbusters of the genre. Out the window goes the story, which is then summarily replaced by the absolute and inescapable emptiness that are the moments that exist only for the viewer to point at the screen and identify this or that character and object more quickly than their friend next door. The cinematic experience, therefore, becomes an uninspired child's game that requires nothing from anyone other than a frankly useless encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture. Even with all the references, ""The Flash"" rarely excites. The battle scenes have few textures and the action is generic and poorly finished accordingly. Post-production is responsible for showing super-powered beings in battles so sumptuous that they lose sight of the human dimension of these extraordinary men and women. And, by the way, the quality of the CGI is not always consistent with the economic power of the production. An initiative full of special appearances, Flash's first solo adventure serves to introduce the concept of the multiverse to DC and make beautiful tributes to his long and sometimes sleepy journey. This journey of weak emotions includes never-before-realized cinematic versions of characters such as Nicolas Cage's Superman (one of the good ideas) and tributes to the precursors of the wave that has reigned for more than 20 years in cinema with a more industrial feel. Furthermore, there are good jokes about changes in timelines - the best of which is about the protagonism of the ""Back to the Future"" Saga. In fact, recharging the ""flux capacitor"" with lightning is another affective borrowing from Robert Zemeckis' creation. However, the solutions are lazy and difficult problems are solved with simplistic strategies - like the lightning bolt that, if replicated, could create armies of Flashes? In the end, even the resolution of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is recycled by DC Comics. Reality almost collapses for the protagonist to learn to accept losses and understand the value of his scars. This film, at least, should be the last of DC's current phase, serving as a reboot of the universe - so it's strange to see a Batman from the past hated by fans appearing in the final scenes in a questionable and confusing participation - it's strange to think that ""Blue Beetle"" and ""Aquaman 2"" would still be released after this production."
The Flash (I) (2023),The Flash,"Barry / The Flash's life is subsumed with the fact that his father is in jail for the murder of his mother. When he discovers that he can run faster than the speed of light, he decides, against the advice of Bruce Wayne, to go back in time to put things right. As we all know though, such plans are always fraught with danger, time line wise and this is no different. Whilst Barry and his past self played by Ezra Miller are largely good fun in this, there are significant sections where they are both deeply irritating which is somewhat distracting. In addition the film includes a contribution by Supergirl played by Sasha Calle giving, at odds with the rest of the film's tone, one of the most miserable performances seen since The Grapes of Wrath hit the screen. That said this is one of the more enjoyable DC superhero movies of the last few years featuring an entertaining story, fun set pieces and strong FX throughout. The big draw here though is the introduction of shots and cameos of past beloved superheroes (and some who nearly were) and a starring role for Michael Keaton returning as Batman. The man provides much kudos here as does the accompanying suit, quite beautifully realised bat cave, bat mobile and plane, even Danny Elfman's glorious music. These factors add to a fun tale that should appeal to most people, but which may not include ardent young fans into DC lore."
The Flash (I) (2023),This movie is a technical showcase...Of 2003!,"WOW...This movie is a joke. Let all the horrible story, the stupid humor, the unlogical plot holes aside. The CGI people! I have seen game intros better than this. Like in 2003. This has to be a hoax. I don't know why CGI seems to be getting worse the last years, but this movie is the ultimate example for bad CGI. I mean, the effects are so bad, they could only get that many stars in, because you sometimes simply can't recognize them. Barry didn't only go back in time to save his mother, but obviously killed all good CGI technicians, that could have worked on this movie. Loved angry Supergirl though, if she wouldn't look like her own bad painted plastic action figure."
The Flash (I) (2023),One of the better DC movies in recent years.,"The Flash has enough action, heart and humor - not to mention fun cameos - to make up for any drawbacks. Worlds collide when the director of both ""IT"" movies sat on the chair of the first comic book movie about the fast young teen in the DCEU. Andy Muschietti showed us a good amount of unique director chooses that enchanted the feeling from the comics. As Michael Keaton brings back the old Batman, with the same vibes, Ezra Miller pulls not one, but two fenomenal performances. The pacing was great and the screenplay was actually good for a comics film (which I am not the biggest fan of). The flash is funny, fittingly fast-paced l, and overall ranks as one of the best DC movies in recent years."
The Flash (I) (2023),One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"The Flash is really bad, it has 0 good jokes, I didn't laugh once, I couldn't remember anything when I finished the movie, it has nothing special to remember at all, it has to be one of the worst character depictions I have ever seen. The scenes from x-men were they show Quicksilver are more memorable than a whole Flash movie. There are too many plotholes everywhere so the movie also makes no sense in so many levels that it is sad how many website have shown up to try to explain this plot holes and most just speculate but offer no good explanation. I saw the movie 2 times as I could not believe it was that bad the first time and I thought I should gave it a second chance, it was a terrible idea, the movie just sucks if you are over 14 years old."
The Flash (I) (2023),"A missed opportunity for a good film, and a bad homage to Keaton","What is good in this film? + Michael Keaton
+ Michael Keaton ! + Michael Keaton !!!! + a hommage to the 89' Batmobile
+ a hommage to Bat stuffes, the Batcave, some antagonists from the earlier DC movies
+ there are some good jokes ( 2-3 throughout the whole film)
+ there are references to unrealised DC film projects
+ the personal tragedy of Flash in his young age is represented well. (have You noticed that only the last one is connected to Flash in a movie called ""Flash"" ?) The negatives:
 EVERYTHING else no, I am not kidding. LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE. The plot goes nowhere. It builds up something, than let it go, without solution. Ezra Miller is not good enough lead. The plot is so bad, that it even cannot provide opportunity to Keaton to show, why we liked him soo much as Batman back in '89-'92. He simply cannt show why this character is interesting. And the whole thing looks like a mess, waisting the opportunity for the introduction of a proper multiverse."
The Flash (I) (2023),Keaton is the best part,"The really bad
The first hour of this is practically unwatchable and the overall story is basically a badly done reimagining of one of the TV show time travel arcs. The effects are beyond horrible and no matter how much people say budget, remember that the Flash TV show did it 10x better in story, acting, and effects on a lower budget continuously. Ezra Miller can act, but the chosen style for the Flash is beyond annoying. What's with the poses before running that take longer than the runs themselves? Did I mention the effects? Every time you finally get into part of the movie, they get obsessed with focusing on the effects and it's just bad again. The good/ok-ish
About an hour in Keaton arrives and it's like a new movie. He gives us an amazing performance that elevates the film while he's in it."
The Flash (I) (2023),Sci-fi movies,"The Flash (2023) is a superhero film that tells the story of Barry Allen, a science nerd who becomes the Flash. The film is full of action, humor, and heart, and it features a great cast of characters, including Ezra Miller as Barry Allen, Michael Keaton as Batman, and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. The film's action sequences are particularly dazzling, and they showcase Barry's lightning-fast abilities in breathtaking slow-motion sequences. But beneath the thrills, The Flash beats with a surprisingly emotional core. Barry's quest to save his mother fuels the narrative, exploring themes of family, loss, and the power of connection across time. Ultimately, The Flash is a triumph of heart, spectacle, and pure superhero joy. It's a film that celebrates family, embraces second chances, and reminds us that even the fastest man alive needs a little human connection. So buckle up, grab your popcorn, and prepare to be swept away by this electrifying cinematic adventure. The Flash is a must-see for superhero fans and anyone seeking a dose of big-screen magic."
The Flash (I) (2023),5*s for Michael Keaton and the Batman tribute... I'm deducting 6*s for the rest of the garbage.,"The 75 star deduction is for seeing Aflac as the first iteration of Batman. The other 20 star deduction is for the casting of Ezra Miller who played the role like a lifeless, robotic, annoying lovechild of Leonard from the Big Bang Theory and Justin Long. Here's a tip...don't do that. Then there's a 15 star deduction for hiring the CGI team from Lawnmower Man who cannot defend this farce from the grave. Another 7 star deduction for the ripoff artist who stole parts of the scores from A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator. Oh, and the script writers...you little scamps...I deduct 17 stars. I know the storyline takes the audience back in time. Did you have to steal all of the gags from Revenge of the Nerds outtakes? This is nothing more than a pandering infomercial for the ""reset"" of the DC cinematic universe. I apologize if this review insults the people who wrote the definition of STUPID. You had no way of knowing. Unless you were visited by the Flash from the future. In which case, A POX ON ALL OF YOUR HOUSES! For the sake of the future, or the past.... DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I also credit 1 star for bringing back George Clooney. He's an excellent actor and maker of film. Batman and Robin was NOT his fault! Yes, I know the stars don't add up to 10...but seeing Michael Keaton as Batman, and hearing those immortal words was only worth 138 out of 10 stars. Blame the film...film flam makers for the 5 out of 10."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Indulgent.,"Dangerous dudes have a deadly stealth weapon on a state of the art submarine. They're Russian, of course. No one can find them, it's... impossible. Twaddle obviously as someone or something hacks their computer and they wind up dead in the water. It's classic action movie intro and this is a classic action movie. I've lost count of where we are in the series and I'm not sure I've seen them all, but it doesn't matter. There's enough back story thrown in to keep even newcomers up to speed and the story slows every now and then to cram in some clunky dialogue ensuring no one gets lost. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a secret agent type working for IMF, a shadowy organisation that looks after the world, keeping the oblivious masses safe from evil. He's tasked to find a key that unlocks that deadly weapon now sat at the bottom of the ocean. A simple enough premise. These films rarely get complicated. The point is the visual spectacle. Car chases through Rome, gun fights in swirling sand storms and runaway trains. Blink and you'll miss something. It probably won't be important, but it might be fun. Cruise handles the action and the pithy one liners, whilst Mark Gatiss covers some of the espionage plot. Outlining to Cary Elwes and other suits that the real danger is a sentient AI hiding its secrets on that sunken sub, how very modern. Find the key, control the weapon, keep the good guys safe, but who are the good guys, who can be trusted. Certainly no government. Hunt and his team, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), the most unlikely trio, set out to find both parts of the key and what it unlocks and kill it before anyone can use it for themselves. It's basically a string of set pieces. Sequences are kept separate to let you catch your breath, but when the action gets cooking, it leans hard on the gas, intercutting chases, with guns being pointed and bombs counting down. It's like Bond, less dramatic, a little more fun, not as clever. The supporting cast are mostly solid. The set pieces are nicely choreographed and the cinematography dialled up to eleventy stupid. It's not without its issues though. It's indulgently long and this is only part one. There's zero justification for this, other than ego (how many minutes do we really need to see Cruise running) and money at the box office. Vanessa Kirby as the wonderful named White Widow scrapes by as one of many villains. Esai Morales too as Gabriel, a fantastical character prone to philosophical claptrap, clearly meant to be an angel of death. It's ticks along well enough, but it's all surface. You don't really care about the characters and some quick cuts and rousing music are not enough to inject any empathy or drama. Two and a hour hours later, nothing much has been achieved other than Cruise getting to have some fun skydiving. I've no idea when part two is due, to be honest I don't really care."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Weakest of the franchise,"Let me start by saying that for a movie to be considered great to me is I could watch it several times and be entertained. This is not one of those movies. I love the MI franchise. This is the first movie where Tom Cruise seems less confident, unsure and slower. Granted he is 60, however after all Ethan Hunt has been through, you'd think he'd be more revered and knows what to do. I felt like Half of the movie was him chasing after Haley Atwell who played the pick pocket. It just got old and redundant. The script seemed like it forced her in and the other better known female agent out who they also decided to kill which was stupid to me. They spent several movies building up her character, only for her to die so simply while Tom was doing his long sprint scene, which there isn't a shortage of in this movie. The main villain is AI. No real life foe we are accustomed to that Tom can have an epic battle with at the end. I feel like this whole AI Terminator Skynet/ Matrix thing has been so played out. I heard and seen so much about Cruises motorcycle off a cliff to BASE jump, that in the movie it seemed like CGI. So what was the point if it didn't even look realistic? What a waste of a stunt and risk of his life. Anyway, the movie is worth at least one watch because it is a MI movie, but just kind of dull and overplayed. My favorites by rank are MI 1, Ghost Protocal, Rouge Nation, Fallout, MI 2 and 3 equally ranked, and lastly this one."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Underrated and underestimated,"I must admit when I first watched this in theaters I did not see the vision. The film rubbed me the wrong way. However I believe my expectations were way too high and was not prepared for a smart story, so in my ignorance I got bored. I refused to see the good. The interesting part here though is that days, weeks and months passed where I couldn't shake the feeling that it was unfair to abandon the movie completely. So I decided to give it another chance at home, alone. This is when it all began to make sense. I finally got the intelligence the movie carried and suddenly I felt guilty for not having giving it a proper chance. I hope that people see it right and I hope that the ignorant reviews don't sway Tom Cruise and his team from the direction and vision they planned for Dead Reckoning Part 2."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Tom has chemistry with a woman. It's a Christmas Miracle.,"In all the movies I have seen Tom Cruise in he never has any romantic chemistry with a co-star. Until now. I thought he had great chemistry with Haley and their characters worked so well together. I was actually bummed when Ilsa showed up. I can't stand her character and they had romantic chemistry of driftwood. And it has nothing against her talent. They just never connected very well together. I was rooting for her to be killed off. So, she would stop taking up screen time. While it was a fun standard action movie. It wasn't the best in the franchise. But not the worst either. I'm looking forward to part two and more Ethan/Grace scenes."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Why,"I love the mission impossible franchise. But I'm rating this mess 2 stars for one reason and one reason only. WHY DID YOU KILL ILSA!!!. The 4 actors that make up the IMF team are or should be invincible kinda like the avengers,had to stop watching that after they killed Iron man and made a joke out of Thor. The fighting scenes in this movie seem a little weak and the action scenes kind of anti climatic. The best action comes at the end with the train scene. So in my opinion which means nothing Rouge Nation and Fallout will continue to be the two best mission impossible movies made. I won't waste my time watching part 2 dead reckoning since you killed Ilsa."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Lazy and mindless,"Think back to the original Mission Impossible (the television series). The essential element was that seemingly impossible missions were made possible by carefully thought out means. While those means might stretch credulity, they still carried a plausibility and attention to detail that were critical to the franchise. The technology, logistics and psychological deceptions were clever. Fast forward to the present and every bit of cleverness and plausibility has evaporated. Nothing really makes sense: escapes depend on ridiculously convenient events; truly impossible tech appears instantly as needed; action sequences continually defy physics. There can be no suspense when magical interventions are easily at hand and guaranteed."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Another solid entry in the series,"""We live and die in the shadows, for those we hold close, and for those we never meet."" If you were following the production of Dead Reckoning, then you know the mission to finish the film was beyond hellish. The entire filming was struck with bad luck. If not, don't worry - I will fill you in. If you already know or don't care - skip the next paragraph. So, this movie and The Batman were hit the hardest during filming due to the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The original plan was to shoot Parts 1 & 2 back to back, but with delays messing up the filming schedule and the budget ballooning to $291 million, making it the most expensive MI film to date. Nicholas Hoult was initially cast as the villain but had to drop out due to his commitments with the TV show The Great. So many crew members contracted COVID-19 that production had to stop for weeks until it eventually started again. Of course, this led to the famous audio rant from Mr. Cruise himself, who yelled at two crew members for not following the rules. Whether you think he was in the right or wrong, it does, however, give us an idea of how stressful it was trying to make a blockbuster during a global pandemic. With the film set in different locations worldwide and the long filming hours, self-isolating during those long months must have been extra tiring. But in the end, it was all worth it. It's 2 hours and 43 minutes long, yet you never feel it. It's got solid pacing - the mark of a good movie. It follows the same formula as the previous films, where a mission goes wrong, and our MI crew must fight all odds to stop a world-ending event, where some people still don't trust Ethan Hunt for whatever reason, despite being right every single time in the past. And yet, it's so entertaining to watch. Director Christopher McQuarrie is the saviour of this franchise, as every entry feels fresh, exciting, and cinematic. McQuarrie understands cinema, the visual language, and the slick rhythm of pace and flow. While the action did not blow me away like Fallout, it's still fantastic. The last action scene involves train carriages one by one falling off a destroyed bridge. It was the most thrilling thing I have seen. The Rome Chase scene had plenty of thrills and comedy to go around. Funny enough, Fast X filmed a chase scene in the same area in Rome, but the comparison between the two movies is night and day. Fast X looked phony with the overuse of CGI, and it was not thrilling enough. Dead Reckoning, on the other hand, was done more practically and looked so much better. It made better use of the area for the action set pieces. Another comparison is that these two action franchises have been going on for a while now, but one is getting better with each installment while the other is getting dumber. How about the stunt of Cruise throwing himself and his motorbike off a cliff, which the trailers showed to death in the marketing, and it still managed to take my breath away when I saw it in IMAX; not many modern movies do that. Movies like this remind us why we go to the cinema. For the thrill, for the experience. I cared about the MI crew. In Dead Reckoning - there is room for emotional depth and always an enjoyable collaboration. A newcomer to the series, Hayley Atwell, is a standout and gave an excellent performance. The funny thing is, she isn't a 20-something newcomer to the film scene or anything like that, as she has already starred in big movies before this, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And yet, this feels like a breakout role. Those movies did her dirty. Pom Klementieff is another newcomer to the series, as the silent but deadly henchman. Most of her character is a mystery but intriguing screen presence. With the main threat being AI, it never felt timelier than ever, even though the script was finished before all the AI mess started to take effect. What is even more perfect for the film's message is that this came out around the Writers and Actors strike, with one of the reasons the strike happened was that movie studios are pushing AI to take over people's jobs. This movie feels like a big middle finger to AI and higher-ups using it. Director Christopher McQuarrie's love for cinema, style, mixture of genres, stunt work, language, and flow with pacing has benefited this series ever since he took over this franchise. The action was exciting, and the score was fantastic. It has been nearly 30 years since this franchise started, and it keeps improving. I do have issues with the film. I admire the real stunt work from behind the scenes, but the use of CGI overshadows the realness of the stunt work, and it's easy to think most of it was on a computer. As I said earlier, it's nowhere near as great as Fallout, as I thought the action scenes and pacing to be better. Other than that, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a solid entry in one of the best action franchises."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Major Character.,"Killing the major character for replacing it with a new one doesn't make sense. To be honest, Ilsa Faust > Grace. Watching the story of a new character is a quite boring. Story is not bad but we don't wanna watch the new character, we wanted to watch and end this series with the characters we have. Writers might think they wanted to watch Ethan to fail with Ilsa's death but it doesn't make sense. Movie could have been better than this if the writers know what they were working on. Very disappointed in this one and not gonna watch the second one because I don't think we will get a better movie than this. I wish they gave us a something better than this but no and it is what it is."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),I don't know if I can choose to accept this is only part of the story,"I don't know if I can choose to accept the fact that, even with a runtime of 164 minutes, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is only half of the story. I felt a little unsatisfied not getting a conclusion after all that. I'm also left wondering why, with a bloated budget of $291 million, this sequel feels less spectacular than the others in the franchise. There are a few fun action sequences along with some suspenseful moments, and I thought Hayley Atwell fit in well with the rest of the cast, but I miss the days when Mission: Impossible was about a singular assignment told in one movie."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),Very disappointing.,"I had high hopes for this movie. I have enjoyed most of the franchise immensely. This movie though, is very poor. The broad picture is one of a super computer, with the power to destroy humanity. Think Skynet. Most unoriginal. It's ability to predict the future has been done in movies many times. It's achilles heel is the same. It has the ability to be everywhere, all the time. Yet somehow, it's fate is tied to one piece of hardware. I would have expected far more originality for such a big production. On the small scale, the plot is littered with a way too many moments where suspending disbelief is the only way to get through. Everyone is an expert pickpocket. Accept all law enforcement personnel, who are totally incompetent. On the whole, a very predictable, unimaginative movie. The silliness of it all could have been softened with a bit of humour, but it takes itself way too seriously. I for one, won't be looking forward to the second installment."
12th Fail (2023),Mindnlowing !!!!!!,"Just supperbbb. I don't remember when i watched such a great movie like this. After a long time got to watch such an excellent movie !!! Really really mind blowing
Such a nice stroy with such great acting of every single person. I mean not vikrant or priyanshu, acting of each and every single person was out of the world. There are really very less movie, very very less which are worth watching every single second. From the first to last the story and the acting and plot kept attached. This movie once again proved that a nice movie doesn't require violence or adultery it requires a great story with great set of people ! Hats off to 12th Fail Team !"
12th Fail (2023),12th Fail is 'Topper of the Class',"This is one of the most beautiful, inspirational and great directorial experience with real life story of IAS officer. The story truly connect with the audience on different level as it contains all the parameters a movie lovers will look for even if it is based on true life story of IAS officer. It gives us all a great message about the life struggle, friendship, love and success. The most beautiful part is how director has took all the small details and gives a great meaning to the story like the classical musical bgm for the Manoj's character as he comes from small village and for shraddha's character the moden musical bgm for her wealthy character. This is one super experience with lot's of great notes a movie should be made. All the cast & crew work their heart out and made sure nothing will be missed."
12th Fail (2023),What a Movie !! 🔥,"Excellent scriptwriting, perfect picturisation, and marvelous dialogue delivered by some of the most prominent actors. Vikrant Messy!! What an actor my gosh, just killed it !! And not just him but all of the cast members of the movie were so true to their character that you won't even feel that it's a movie and not reality. It is based on a true story of IPS officer Manoj Kumar Sharma. A man of honesty, integrity and high self esteem, who in spite of the many challenges of his impossible life, raised himself from being a 12th failed boy of notorious Chambal to become an IPS officer. He is currently serving as the Additional Police Commissioner of the West Region in Mumbai. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most relevant movies of the present time which grabs the audience's attention instead of wasting money and time on useless Big Banner movies of Bollywood.!!"

12th Fail (2023),A Bollywood masterpiece in the age of commercial movies,"What a heart-touching, inspiring, and exhilarating film! A big shout-out to Vikrant Massey for brilliantly showcasing the role of a poor UPSC aspirant. His acting immerses you in the character of Manoj and makes you eagerly wait for the time he becomes an IPS. Besides, kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for not only choosing this story, but also bringing this masterpiece to the audience with a brilliant screenplay and realistic direction. Despite being such a small-scale film, 12th Fail has produced some inspiring and loveable character portrayals in Shraddha, Gauri bhaiya, Pritam etc. That will stay for a long time with the audience. Was simply worth watching! Loved it!"
12th Fail (2023),Inspirational and Motivational 😌🔥,"This has to be the best movie. One of the best there is out there. Bollywood still has some amazing talent left. The roles, the skills, the talent. Vaah Bhai bas masth hai yaar movie dekhlo maaza aajayega. Learnt alot of lessons from this movie alone. Hardworking people will always give a tough challenge and fight to people who are talented. If you're in love with your passion. You will achieve it. Because you will be willing to risk everything to achieve it. No matter the cost. Just give it a try this movie will make you fall in love with following your passion. Learn to never ever give up no matter what !!"
12th Fail (2023),This should bollywood be like!,This is one of the best bollywood movies I habe seen in recent times. The Hero and Heroine we deserve. The learning and entertainment we should desire. Hats off to the team and hats off to Mr and Mrs Sharma to be for eachother in all the even and odds. A story that got a pen and then got a visual to be spread across generations. Indian youth should see and strive to walk on the foot prints of Sharmaji. I would like to see this movie getting 10/10 rating so it will set a benchmark for others to follow and make such ensuring and motivational movies for our young generation. Now I'm exhausted with my word.😄
12th Fail (2023),Fine Cinema,"The film meticulously delineates Manoj's character development, showcasing his unwavering commitment to overcome the obstacles strewn in his path despite lacking conventional academic success. His resolute nature and unyielding focus act as a beacon, illuminating the essence of persistence amidst the societal pressures and norms that often tend to pigeonhole individuals based on academic achievements. Through Manoj's character, the film masterfully sheds light on the broader socio-economic landscape prevalent in India, where the societal class divide often hampers the prospects of individuals like him. It resonates profoundly with the struggles faced by many from underprivileged backgrounds, navigating a system that frequently disregards their potential due to a lack of formal education or societal privileges. Manoj's journey serves as an allegory for the collective aspirations of the marginalized sections of society. His resilience not only symbolizes personal triumph but also serves as an inspiration, igniting a beacon of hope for countless individuals facing similar challenges. The film brilliantly portrays how determination and dedication can transcend societal limitations, empowering individuals to forge their paths despite daunting odds. The cinematic craftsmanship of the movie deserves recognition for its meticulous attention to detail in character development, storyline, and thematic depth. The director's vision, coupled with stellar performances, effectively captures the emotional and psychological nuances of the characters, offering a compelling narrative that resonates beyond the confines of the screen."
12th Fail (2023),A GENUINE MASTERPIECE,Pure class and I am short on my word to describe this masterpiece. Must watch movie and I will regret for not watching this in theatres. A true inspiration amongs the youngester and displaying sheer motivation. A young boy from small village life full of struggle but with pure dedication and STUBBORN attitude that what makes him what he wanted or what he dreamt of. Honesty is above anything and also Great power comes with great responsibilities. Conclusion- A girl type shraddha what a man needs in life. Great Actors makes the film great but fabulous direction what's make the film MASTERPIECE. Kudos to Director-Vinu Vinod Chopra.
The Promised Land (2023),A must see movie...,"The Promised Land takes place in 1700's Denmark and tells the story of a retired military officer who wants to settle and farm in an inhospitable area where no one else has been able to survive. He has visions of making a great success, and being greatly rewarded by the King and other noble people. That is just the vaguest outline of the story but the film goes deep into the characters involved and becomes unexpectedly dark, much darker than I had imagined. I will not say more so as not to spoil it, but this is a truly great movie. The main character is played to perfection by Mads Mickelson. The associated actors Amanda Collin, Kristine Thorp, and the young child actor Melina Hagberg are very much up to the task of making their characters come alive. A great film that I could not recommend more."
The Promised Land (2023),Fans of Mads will be pleased,"The Promised Land (2023) Mads Mikkelsen is an actor who needs no praise and yet every time I see him in a film, my level of admiration grows even more. The sense of honor and dignity are so profound in this man as he commands a powerful on-screen presence in every scene. Asides from knowing that this was a historical drama, I didn't even bother to read the synopsis as I had faith in the lead actor. Oh and if you love potatoes, you are going to enjoy this even more. The Promised Land is a true story of Ludvig Kahlen, a man determined on building a settlement in the Danish wilderness in order to attain wealth and honor. Being an ex-soldier he will use his meager savings in an attempt to make this dream a reality but before long, he will encounter more than a handful of obstacles imposed by a wealthy landowner who is determined to prevent Ludvig from achieving his goal. Despite taking place in Denmark, this film can somewhat be classified as a Historical-Western due to it's use of wide shots, beautiful nature, a respectable stoic protagonist and a sense of perpetual struggle against oppressors. When you think about it, the historical event in question is quite insignificant on a large scale and if not for Mads Mikkelsen, this film wouldn't have existed. Thankfully it was made and asides from Mads' captivating performance, the rest of the cast came to put in a collective effort that made me genuinely care about the struggle. The cinematography is simple yet beautiful and the well used score manages to both accentuate a rural setting and pull on the emotional strings. Overall, a well made film that leaves a pleasant aftertaste and if you are a fellow fan of Mads, you won't be disappointed. Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews."
The Promised Land (2023),This is why I love cinema,"This film is as good as they get and has everything anyone could ever want. A fantastic storyline, wonderful cinematography, sharp dialogue without a word extra or wasted, the actors pitch their performances at exactly the right level and the time flies by without a single dull moment. Other reviewers here have commented that this is the best film they have seen all year. As someone who goes to the cinema a LOT to watch all genres of movies from all over the world I feel I should add that - yes, they are right and i agree - this is the best movie I have seen this year. Treat yourself and go to see it. Magnificent."
The Promised Land (2023),"Great story, characters and acting","This is a historical drama set in Denmark in the 1700's. A recently discharged Captain has a dream to create a farm on the inhabitable moorland of what is now Jutland. He knows the King of Denmark is keen to expand into the area and he requests permission to build a house and to farm the land. He gets it because the belief is it's impossible to farm the moorlands and it's no loss for the crown to gamble on him. The movie takes us on a journey of a decent , honest man who rose from the ranks to achieve a commission in the army which at the time was very rare. This venture pits his honour and morals against riches and coercion from established landowners who all plot his downfall. The acting is excellent and the characters are all interesting with back stories. The challenges and decisions he has to make are sometimes unbearable to watch but the screenplay is so well written and executed that it is a joy to watch. All will feel emotions when watching this movie. The cinematography is first class. This movie has been submitted for the 2024 Oscar's as best international film , it is a strong contender. Highly recommended."
The Promised Land (2023),An Absolute Gem,"Its been a year for me of watching mediocre movies and overloads of mcu reboots and the crap that falls into theaters nowadays. I stumbled on to this movie by accident and I have to say its beyond touching and leaves you feeling like you reminisce on your own life and what you really want from it. Its rare that im so touched by a movie like this. Its like oregon trail meets revenge thriller meets introspective noire. I absolutely loved this film

The Promised Land (2023),A Great Film With A lot Said,"A disciplined able man with a goal, breaks for his heart. A great movie draws emotion and The Promised Land did just that. I want to talk about the plot, meaning or message this move communicates or represents. Through its ups and downs The Promised Land was not so promised it seems. Through the lies, deceit and chose a disciplined and abled man ultimately accomplish his goal. Who knew potato farming could be so scrutinizing, life threatening and symbolic. Everyone has an agenda and sometimes your on the right side of the coin. A good plan, dudeliegense and luck can some times be enough. What gives status? Money, achievements, strength, power, a title? Can it be inherited? Must it be worked for? And, once achieved what will one do to keep thy status. Will thy risk reputation, honour, life, murder, cheat, lie, endlessly work so focused that you seem insane. I experienced this movie and from my observation I realized that purpose of life can change. Even the most ridged man can be bent, by his heart. And, I think he made the right choice."
The Promised Land (2023),Beautifully Amazing!!!,"Great period piece,set in Europe,remincent of American pioneering epics. Beautifully shot , sharp direction and matched with amazing acting. This movie captivated me from the beginning and did not let go till closing credits. I'm not sure how the director managed to tell this story so seamlessly but imagine the artist he was working with had alot to do with it. From Mads to the background actors the movie was perfectly cast. To nail that is a miracle. Also, I usually complain about,not providing enough charactor background, but amazingly I did not need anymore than they gave! I felt emotionally invested. Best Movie I've seen 2023."
The Promised Land (2023),Deep Empirical Resonance,"Wonderful emotional performances all round. Solid cast. Overcoming adversity amidst trying conditions. Holding on to his beliefs and trying all means to reach his goal. Mads stoic performance really wins you over to the characters inner turmoil and struggles as he is constantly being put into situating where he had to make tough decisions. Really a revelation in his performance. The underlying love story between the him and the female lead is deep and poignant. The love shared in the care for the Romani child between them is resonant. I was disappointed that they tried to wrap things up quickly. His adopted child leaving him for her future might not ring true as seeing him alone, i don't think that she would have left him to fend for himself. And the diem freedom that drove him to abandon everything to free his love just was to convenient even though I appreciated the emotional closure. I am sure that viewers will enjoy. Excellent.."
The Promised Land (2023),Rough and cold in the 1600 Denmark,"A costume drama played out in the 1600 Denmark. Its a rough and cold depiction of the life of a man trying to make a name of himself. What makes this movie is the characters and the acting. Mads Mikkelsen plays Ludvig Kahlen, the main character of this movie. Mads makes a believable character depiction of Ludvig, although we dont really know how Ludvig was, so he couldve been quite different IRL. The rest of the cast performance is mostly good but two characters are misscasts. The guy who plays the priest and the girl who plays the stray girl are really bad actors. Both playing swedish characters. Its not just bad acting, it seems the director wanted to make them look bad. The dialect is of present time(2023) and its like they forget they are suppose to play characters of the past. Im just gonna assume they got their roles through corruption. Besides some misscast and poor directing, this movie seem to follow some diversity quota bcs the stray girl is played by a mixed raxe girl looking very middle eastern, thus does not fit the history but probably the movie criteria for casting. Its sad to see the movie industry engaging in politics bcs its rewriting history for political ends. The story is quite simple, Mads character are met with people who tries to ruin his attempt to further himself. It gets bloody at times and its a very harsh and sad story. Not much beauty or warmth in this flic, in fact you will probably leave the theater having a cold. In summary, you wont laugh to this movie and I dont really see why they made it. It doesnt leave you with much but a cold rough stain. Go out and lick the street on a chilly autumn day and you will get the same feeling as this movie will give you."
The Promised Land (2023),For the lover of historical drama,"It is my understanding this is based upon at true person, whether the story is true I am unsure. And the film is based on a novel about this person. Mads is allowed to be himself more than normal here, as the whole film is in Danish. While Danish is similar to German and Norwegian and Swedish (because of the location and how they all became to be), if you are familiar with any of these languages you may pick up things here and there. But otherwise you shall need the English subtitles to survive the film. This does have just over a 2 hour run time, and with some dramas you can feel that drag along. On occasion I felt like it needed a push to get where it needed to go, but then the antagonist would come into the picture and be the utmost vile person and I would just want our hero to go full Hannibal on him. But, that's not who Mads was playing; not that the Captain didn't have his own temperment and skills. Be warned there is some violence you wouldn't expect. But all of the romance is very tame. And there were some very lovely adopted family scenes as well, nice to see Mads play dad. For the lovers of foreign and historical drama, this will scratch that itch very well."
Bank of Dave (2023),"Something good, Something bad","My wife and I were off to a good movie and indeed it was for the most part. I remembered a caption at the start that said something like ""true story (mostly)"" so I immediately wondered throughout what part isn't true. We never found out. The bad for me is revealed in the first five minutes with a blaspheming utterance of ""Christ"". It comes again later as well. Do I need to explain why this is very offensive? I hope not. As the story moves along, the Dave character becomes more appealing due to his determination for this great cause, yet he remains above the fray. The way things work out leave us satisfied but I still wonder what part was:""almost true""."
Bank of Dave (2023),It was a feel good movie,"At first the movie kept my interest. Very good premise: open a bank in England, a near impossible feat and has not been done in last 150 years. Also, it's not the usual political left-wing fodder that is typically aired on Netflix. But then it really felt like it was dragging on. I had to turn off and back on again because it really felt too long. Having said that, the story is a good one. The acting is good. Good music too. I read on this site that it is based on a true story. I read that it is very loosely based on a true story, and a lot of reviewers didn't like that, as a lot of it was embellished and untrue. I can't comment on this part, as I didn't realize a new bank came into existence in England and that it still exists today. In spite of the above, I recommend this film. I do think it could have been shaved down by about 30 minutes or so."
Bank of Dave (2023),Great movie!,"Always fun when the little guy takes on the big guys and wins - especially when it's based on a true story. So tired of all the fighting, violence and mayhem in so many of the movies these days - this is a breath of fresh air. Such a delightful, feel good movie. Great cast, great acting, we need more movies like this one. Great, lovely, fun, entertaining, thank you! Always fun when the little guy takes on the big guys and wins - especially when it's based on a true story. So tired of all the fighting, violence and mayhem in so many of the movies these days - this is a breath of fresh air. Such a delightful, feel good movie. Great cast, great acting, we need more movies like this one."
Bank of Dave (2023),An Actually Legit Feel-Good Movie,"We need more movies like this! I saw this on Netflix and turned it on with my parents over the holidays cause it looks kind of interesting, and what do I find? Likable characters to cheer for. A fun movie with some good humor. Nothing inappropriate besides some language, which, honestly, they should have just kept it out. (There's no reason this movie shouldn't have been PG.) But all the same, I do recommend giving it a watch! It's a real, honest-to-goodness feel-good movie that has a good message. While it's not a mind-blowing or revolutionary film, it's actually a good one. I'd highly recommend giving it a watch!"
Bank of Dave (2023),Feel good enjoyable work of fiction,"(Spoilers) As stories go, it's a feel good show about taking on the evil elites with a great soundtrack thanks to Def Leppard. Just don't leave the show thinking it was a documentary as most of it is pure fiction. For instance, the Def never helped ( they should make a hefty donation yesterday for showing and truly acting like they did an incredibly generous thing). So just put that in your pocket and enjoy a pleasant very watchable fable of a small Northern town taking it on the big bad boys of London. The script is solid and well written with no stilted dialogue or hackneyed plot points, though the unnecessary romance is just that and fairly obvious just that. There is a nice cameo from the now thinner and yet still entitled Lord Grantham. Josh Fry, who nearly stole the show in Yesteryear, ably drives the story as the lawyer who is convinced by the ebullient Dave that his lost cause is one he's willing to fight for."
Bank of Dave (2023),complicated assignment for legal eagle,"When a local businessman tries to set up a local bank to help out his neighbors, he runs into obstacles on all sides. To help him wade through the legal issues, the law firm sends hugh (joel fry) to assist dave. But all the legal eagles expect that dave will run out of time, energy, or money before he can actually start a new, local bank. It's a good story, if a bit slow. I did recognize hugh bonneville of downton abbey, paddington, and so many more! Here, he is sir charles, shown as the bad guy, the cruella figure. Also paul kaye, from thrones, doctor who, and midsomer murders. Lots of time spent on a small, local band. And a couple songs performed by def leppard. And just when we think it's clear sailing, there's still another thirty minutes of film. Clearly, there are more roadblocks to come! Good story, good acting. Directed by chris foggin. Based on a true-ish story, screenplay by piers ashworth. It's good."
Bank of Dave (2023),A Truly Enjoyable Film to Watch,"My wife and I just finished watching ""Bank of Dave"" on Netflix. As we are but a few days before Christmas, one can find any number of enjoyable movies - from 'classics' such as ""White Christmas"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to relatively new movies such as ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""Elf."" These all are enjoyed by many of us on an annual basis. But they all require us to suspend reality to some extent. ""Bank of Dave"" is enjoyable for sure. But it has one thing going for it that the others don't. ""Bank of Dave"" is based upon true life experiences. There truly is such a bank. In spite of the requirements (required of all banks) it faced to get approved, they were met and the Bank of Dave was the first bank approved in England in 150 years. I don't want to tell more about the movie's storyline. Rather, I'll just strongly suggest you watch it. It is a lighthearted movie that is a joy to behold. If you have a Netflix account, you can watch it there as we did. I understand there are other options to rent or even buy a digital copy. Again, I'm quite sure you'll be glad did."
Bank of Dave (2023),David v Goliath Feel-Good True Story Brit Style,"Engaging and endearing story of the man who chartered the first new bank in Great Britain in over 350 years. Take out greed, the need for Government bail outs, and the stuffy long-time privileged insider aspect of British banks, and add in a local business leader's mission to start a non-profit bank to help his local community economy thrive, and you have a great feel-good story to off-set at least a bit of the negative image for which banks have earned for years. Never pretends to be something it isn't, just an example of good intentions brought to fruition by some good people. Nice Holiday surprise that maintains a light touch, and avoids manipulative cliche' movie touches too often applied in some films. 👍👍"
Bank of Dave (2023),Super movie,"The film is a vivid example of the mistake of choosing a capitalist regime. This is a film about real communism, or rather the struggle of communism over capitalism. Dave, his family and friends, residents of a wonderful city build their happiness with their own hands. They are doing their best to make comfortable conditions in the city for everyone. But the capitalist authorities actively interfere with them. They don't give money for the hospital and so on. Dave wants to open a bank and solve the problems of the city, but even here the bank capitalists are actively interfering. Only by creating communism in his city does Dave manage to solve all the problems. From Russia with love."
Bank of Dave (2023),We all love an underdog,"This is a heart-warming kind of true story about a little guy taking on the big guys. It feels like a tale well told but there are some nice moments in it, despite some of the implausibility of some of the plot. Characters feel like caricatures, and some of the story feels cliched. The romantic side of the story feels somewhat tacked on, and maybe the whole film is maybe 15mins too long. That said though, it's an enjoyable Sunday-evening watch, that you can't help but smile at. Rory Kinnear is excellent as always and some of the other parts are pretty well-played. At its heart is a frustrating but important message - that the top 1% as always look after themselves to the detriment of others and not caring about their impact - whether that be social, financial or environmental. But this is a story about the underdogs, who don't care about the odds, and we all love an underdog."
One Life (2023),Phenomenal Man,"Sir Nicholas Winton has been one of my personal heroes for a long time. There is something so special about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I went into this movie prepared to be disappointed because of how much I already knew and respected this story but this movie did it justice. They truly captured the heart of this man, the way that he is so modest about the work he did. A lot of people will know of Sir Nicholas Winton from the clip of him on ""Thats life"" which is extremely powerful. The fact that descendants of the kids he saved were in the audience was very fitting and moving. All in all, I really really loved it. So much so that I watched it in the cinema two days in a row. I would recommend this to anyone."
One Life (2023),A well lived life.,"Giving this an 8/10 rating Another film this week, based on true events, with Anthony Hopkins showing that while there is good work out there, he is more than up to the task. Johnny Flynn plays his the younger version of the Hopkins character, set in World War 2, and is proper good. Helena Bonham Carter, Lena Olin, Samantha Spiro, Romola Garai and all the cast are not wasted at all, they all deliver in this quite extraordinary story of and impossible task that happened. Did hate the 1980's and they capture it's plainness too well. That's a good thing, the script is very simple with it zipping along at a calm pace that suits the film, The bleakness of the look during the second world war is a tribute to the great sets, costumes and production design. Soft sound, no real bangs, but still there is the Nazi evil and grief that is quite plain too see. Anthony Hopkins is the main selling point here and he does what he does with the role which is gentle and he can do this kind of thing effortlessly."
One Life (2023),Outstanding - heartbreaking and inspiring,"Just thinking about the That's Life clip brings a lump to the throat and this entire film was a build up to that moment. Outstanding story telling with little forced emotion or contrived set ups. Incredibly understated. Excellent pace between the two time periods and on two occasions I forgot that we weee going to switch back. Very well balanced with both the main characters getting a fair share of opportunity for an excellent performance. I had just one 'yeah but', relating to some of the That's Life audience but even this is explained away beautifully in the final on screen notes...even my 15 year old son with an empathy deficiency had a tear in his eye! No notes!"
One Life (2023),"One Life - Based on the Book ""If It's Not Impossible""","Documentary drama, based on a true story. This follows the story of Nicholas (Nicky) Winton, a British stockbroker who visits Czechoslovakia in 1938. The film starts in the 1980's, Nickolas is an elderly man, there are many flashback scenes to 1938, where is see the young Nickolas's efforts to rescue 669 Jewish children from becoming victims of the Nazi holocaust. Nickolas kept a scrapbook, which is a character in itself and how the media get hold of the story. Nickolas never sees himself as a hero, he simply immediately did what he thought was urgently necessary. If you didn't already know, you'd definitely guess it was a BBC Films production. I can imagine this will be screened on TV as soon as Christmas 2024. Emotional. Recommended."
One Life (2023),One ordinary person doing above ordinary humanity,"A British stockbroker and humanitarian whos' accomplishments remained unknown and unnoticed by the world still today. Some of their achievements only came to light after 50 years when they where cornered by a television programme. The British press celebrated him and dubbed him the ""British Schindler"". In 2003, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for ""services to humanity. On 28 October 2014, he was awarded the highest honour of the Czech Republic, the Order of the White Lion (1st class), by Czech President Milos Zeman, nine months before his death, aged 106. Based on the book 'If It's Not Impossible...The Life of Sir Nicholas Winton,
@AnthonyHopkins plays the older Sir Winton amazingly showing how being humble with a caring focus on others achieves great things. @HelenaBonhamCarter is plays the mother every child wishes for. @JohnnyFlynn as the younger Winton shows how true empathy that we all should learn from. Not taking away from the others in the movie, this is one movie the whole family needs to see, no matter what background, culture, or political leanings, even one for the school circularium. It is the right mix, even for some like me who would have liked to dive further into some of the issues and obstacles. @jamesHawes @LucindaCoxon @NickDrake @JoannaLaurie @IainCanning @EmileSherman @GuyHeeley Thank you for what captures the greatest of humanity for generations to come. My only disappointment was after sitting through all the credits, the movie is dedicated to a few people, but a photo of Sir Winton would help people to further research and learn."
One Life (2023),A true story told with respect and heart,"Anthony Hopkins' performance as Nicholas Winton gives exceptional depth to a role that could have been sentimental in others' hands. We meet this charitable yet tetchy man in his old age, underplaying the major role he played in rescuing so many Jewish children from the Nazis and death camps, yet deeply regretting the loss of those who never made it. There is a fine supporting cast. The scenes of team work to get the children out between the younger Winton, played by Johnny Flynn and Winton's mother Babi, played by a feisty Helen Bonham-Carter, give energy and urgency. We see where Winton's commitment to help others comes from. It's pleasing to see that there are no uncomfortable Jewish stereotypes. The scene with the Czech rabbi, played by Samuel Finzi, initially torn between removing Jewish children from their parents, yet moving to a position of complete trust in Winton's integrity, reflects the director James Hawes' commitment to authenticity. The That's Life scene in the film does include family of the Czech Kindertransport refugees who were saved by Winton. However, Anthony Hopkins was not told this before filming the sequence. Although I was concerned such a precious TV moment from the past wouldn't ring true, in fact, it had the same power. Prepare to shed some tears. This is a moving film that tells an important true story with respect and heart."
One Life (2023),A true hero !,"Nicholas Winton became widely known in Britain decades ago when the ""That's Life !"" TV programme revealed his role in organising the Kindertransport trains which saved over 600 Jewish children from almost-certain death in a Czechoslovakia which had been controlled by Nazi Germany since it invaded the Sudentenland in 1938 by bringing them to Britain. The film alternates between the 1930s and modern times and both Anthony Hopkins (playing the older Winton) and Johnny Flynn (playing the younger Winton) are excellent - as is Helen Bonham Carter playing Winton's mother. One of the most moving sections is Winton's endless regret for the fact that the 250 children on the ninth - and last - train could not be saved as the train was due to leave Prague station on 1st September 1939 - the day on which Britain declared war on Germany. A most moving film and I defy anyone who watches it to deny that they have had to brush away tears from time to time. This film deserves to be as well-regarded as Schindler's List."
One Life (2023),Exceptional piece of work,"This is truly an exceptional piece of work. Having seen the trailer it could've easily been made to look and feel quite tacky but I was genuinely surprised and extremely impressed by what has been accomplished. Every step of the production was presented exactly as you would want from a time period piece and I don't recall seeing any cgi at all and certainly none which could've potentially shattered the illusion. The commitment of the actors, both past and present versions were magnificent and made you completely believe their situations. The story is an exceptional one and I'm glad that it has been told in exactly the way it was & it absolutely destroyed me & I don't think there was a dry eye left from anyone in the cinema screening that I watched it in. Anything which gives me the immediate emotional reaction that this did means that it deserves a full 5 stars."
One Life (2023),Heartbreaking & Heartwarming,"I rarely concern myself with the opinions of others, especially professional critics, but some of the negative reviews I've read about this are churlish to say the least. I think one of the big positives of this film is that it just tells the story. Most of us in UK probably know the story of Sir Nicholas Winton and how he organised the transport of 669 Czech Jewish children to relative safety in the UK in the face of the Nazi onslaught in the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. Despite what some suggest, it clearly shows that this is a team effort led by Winton's persistence and determination; it does not make him out to be the sole hero. However, as important as the evacuations is the story about how it came into the British consciousness via the quirky 1970s BBC TV show, 'That's Life.' It truly is something that needed to be told, then and now, and is done so in a suitably serious nut heartwarming manner. Do go and see it and do be prepared for the final scenes."
One Life (2023),Great film,"I actually remember the episode of 'That's Life' in 1988, where Esther Rantzen asked everybody in the audience: Who here owes their life to Nicholas Winton,? Then please stand up. The whole audience standing, was very very moving then, on TV and it's equally powerful when recreated in this film. The story is, as part of volunteers, he and others, managed to get 669 children out of Czechoslovakia as the Nazis marched in. It's a slow starting film, but builds to the very moving finale. Anthony Hopkins is just brilliant playing Winton. Well worth a watch as it is a true story (not Hollywood writing history) Also thought provoking is that 48 years after the start of WW2 and there was Winton in our 'modern world' on TV in 'That's Life'. How could such terrible events be within one persons life time ? Then you look at the wars going on in world today and realise, with all our civilization and technology, barbarity is always lurking nearby,"
GoodFellas (1990),"Goodfellas: A Cinematic Rollercoaster Through Mob Life, Scorsese's Masterpiece Earns a Solid 8/10 for Its Intensity and Timeless Appeal","Goodfellas, an 8, dude! Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity. The storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life. Sure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences. A solid 8 because it's a classic that stands the test of time, leaving you with a mix of awe and a twisted appreciation for the mob's twisted world."
GoodFellas (1990),The cinematic tour de force,"""Goodfellas"" is a cinematic tour de force, a gritty and electrifying portrayal of the American mafia that stands as a testament to Martin Scorsese's directorial genius. Adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy,"" this film immerses viewers into the seductive yet perilous world of organized crime, offering an unflinching glimpse into the rise and fall of a mobster. The narrative follows the life of Henry Hill, portrayed with captivating charisma by Ray Liotta, as he navigates the hierarchy of the mob alongside his volatile friend Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and the calculating Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Scorsese's direction infuses the film with an unparalleled kinetic energy, propelling the audience through decades of mob life, punctuated by moments of violence, opulence, and betrayal. What sets ""Goodfellas"" apart is its masterful storytelling and immersive cinematography. Scorsese employs dazzling tracking shots, rapid-fire editing, and a pulsating soundtrack to create a visceral and frenetic experience that mirrors the chaos and allure of the criminal underworld. The performances are nothing short of mesmerizing, with Pesci's volatile and menacing portrayal earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Liotta's portrayal of Henry Hill's descent into the darker realms of organized crime is layered with depth and nuance, while De Niro's presence adds gravitas to the intricate web of loyalty and betrayal. At its core, ""Goodfellas"" delves into the seductive allure and moral decay of the criminal lifestyle. It doesn't glorify crime but rather peels back its layers to reveal the brutal consequences and human cost of choosing such a path. The film's impact extends beyond its critical acclaim; it has become a cultural touchstone, influencing subsequent crime dramas and leaving an indelible mark on popular culture. Its legacy lies in its ability to captivate audiences with its unapologetic portrayal of the criminal underworld while offering a cautionary tale about the fleeting rewards and inevitable repercussions of a life of crime."
GoodFellas (1990),The horrible lives of gangsters,"I am not much of a fan of maffia films but I see the great quality of this film. The acting, the direction, the camera work, the sets and costumes are all top notch. This film kept me interested and engaged throughout, if a bit baffled at the depressingly violent lives that the characters chose to live. We follow the life of a gangster with a voiceover (unnecessary in my view) telling us how young Henry is attracted to the glamour and power of the gangster lifestyle from childhood. It appears to be his only way out of a boring working class life. Henry makes his way up the ranks, although he realises that as a non-Italian he will never reach the top. Other than the money and the power it is difficult to understand what it is Henry enjoys about his maffia life. The mobsters live in a claustrophobic, paranoid world, where supposed friends can turn on each other at any moment. Most of the mobsters are obnoxious, violent psychopaths as well as complete morons. They blow their blood money on tacky homes, cars and clothes, greedy wives and sleazy girlfriends. Henry's wife gets a voice in this movie too, which is interesting. She willingly chooses this mobster to start a family with, despite the danger, the stress and the trauma it causes to her children (which we see crying a lot). All in all, all of the main characters come across as highly unsympathetic and I found it difficult to understand what kept them in the horror lives they were living. But then again, once you've entered the world of crime, it is probably very difficult to get out. So, perhaps it was a morality tale: stay away from the world of crime and drugs are bad, m'kay."
GoodFellas (1990),I don't know why I waited so long to see it.,"I'm always excited to see Ray Liotta (R. I.-so much-P.!) in films and tv shows, but after watching Goodfellas last night with my family, I get why he was so beloved and respected. He went to 11, and filled every moment with charm and realism. Absolutely loved the cast, camerawork, cinematography, plot, AND it's a rare example of a film where narration actually motivates and enhances the story, rather than merely commenting on it. I've been a fan of Scorsese's ever since I saw Taxi Driver at way too young an age, and now this is by far my favorite work of his. My only complaint is that I've heard so many jokes over the years about Jimmy Two Times (""Get the papers, get the papers"") that I was surprised he only appears once, very briefly. I would've liked to see more of that character, in context."
GoodFellas (1990),Goodfellas,"I remember when this film first came out. Pretty much the whole cast was pretty much perfect. Joe Pesci in the film was one of favorites. When he shot that it bring him his drinks. It was creepy, and weird and the reason why. It just showed how powerful Joe was in that film. So good he looked crazy in that film. The best part is DO NO MESS WITH THE TINY MAN. He was the little man in that film but the most scariest one. He was so great in that film Joe in all films was probably in years it was just so well done. It is just hard to explain how this film really makes me feel. I grew up around some of that stuff. It does happen and some people you mess with and some you don't. If you did mess with them or rat them out. Then they will take you out no matter What. So just be careful in life about everything."
GoodFellas (1990),The rise and fall of these mobsters.,"A very ambitious and interesting film. The movie starts with our main character as just a boy narrating how he became a gangster and we follow him through is life. The film has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and looks terrific in 4k, as do so many movies of this era shot on film. The films set design, costumes and props all deserve praise. It's a dark looking movie with a lot of it taking place at night or in these shady bars and houses. We see the twisted values of the mob, a macho world where violence speaks louder than words. The story you can follow but it does occasionally get a bit tricky to keep track of, given the large cast. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for this playing an erratic psychopath, a volcano that can erupt at any moment. This is film with a great deal of anger in it too, all it's characters harbour these terrible emotions. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco deserve lots of praise for their work. The film also shows us the drugs and paranoia the main character descends into. I didn't find the characters all that relatable when they're all essentially villains, but that's the difficulty of making a film like this. The film never really shows the impact the violence has on other characters either, but I suppose everyone is so used to it that they just accept it. The film doesn't do what the untouchables did and give us an important police character we can also follow, the story is seen squarely through the eyes of the gangsters."
GoodFellas (1990),"7.0/10 - Very Well-Made, Not Powerful Enough to Get Me Emotionally Invested","Martin Scorsese is handily one of the most popular and well-known directors out there. Ask every average filmbro and they'll tell you how much they worship the ground this guy walks. As a certified film nerd myself, of course I got to watch some of his films before. They've all been fun overall, and somewhere between pretty solid to good, but I'm yet to fall in love with a Scorsese movie. The most recent Scorsese film that I've reviewed was The Departed, which I've had a good time with but couldn't see it as the masterpiece people claim it is, and I'm pretty sure that I used the same terminology in my review for The Departed as well - yet to make me fall in love with Scorsese's work. I mean, come on, guys, I don't want us to be just friendly faces in the lobby of the building, I want us to be more. *sigh* But jokes aside, let's get into the review. Often considered to be Scorsese's defining masterpiece, Goodfellas is based on a book, which, in its turn, describes the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a notorious New-York gangster who started out young. Really young. This movie basically follows his rise and his fall, with a special focus on the relationship he had with two other gangsters - James Conway (Robert De Niro, which is probably the actor most associated with Scorsese) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). If you find this plot description a little vague, well, it's not a coincidence - this film hardly has a coherent, easy to sum-up story. It's more like a timeline, filled with little stories that paint a bigger picture, than a straightforward, classic storyline. It's not completely random structure-wise, of course. Like I said, it's about the rise and fall, and as the movie progresses the small doses of Henry's life that we get are less glamorous, less shiny, and the so-called gangster lifestyle shows its true, bloody colors. Talking about bloody colors, one thing that I absolutely love here is the cinematography. Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen, this one's handily the best-directed one. I love the use of red and black as main colors in certain scenes, especially when it becomes sort of hazy and surreal because of it. The famous one-shot scene, the dynamic camerawork and editing, the memorable compositions, everything just comes together to create quite a beautiful result. The cinematography makes this movie feel ALIVE, you know what I mean? One of the best aspects of my experience with it. Scorsese undoubtedly knows his craft, and he works with people who know what they're doing as well. The soundtrack is also pretty cool. It's always the same vibe with Scorsese soundtracks, from my experience so far (dad-rock stuff or classic pop hits from the 1950's), but he always has solid ones. I also enjoyed how he handled a pretty big ensemble of characters with enough attention to each so you can feel how big the mafia is and how it surrounds Henry everywhere he goes, but not so much that it would feel tiresome. It's nice, and rather immersive. Cool stuff. I guess that my main issue with this movie is that I wasn't really emotionally invested. This movie is just good enough to be pretty fun while watching, but I never was fully gripped by the plot, never was truly moved or impacted emotionally by watching, except for maybe a few moments here and there. There are some scenes that are iconic and memorable - I like the ""you're a funny guy"" one, the one where a shovel is involved, and the wake-up-darling scenes, but it never passes the threshold, the critical point where it becomes actually powerful. Just pretty good, I guess. One last thing I want to address - I'm having conflicted feelings regarding the way that Henry narrates this film. I feel like it should, on paper, get me more immersed (City of God is my favorite example of a good use of a narrator voiceover), but in reality it just feels a bit...I don't know, flat? It should've had more character, at least, and it was rather dry here compared to how it could've been. It's not bad, and I like the way that some moments are narrated, but something's definitely lacking here. Goodfellas is a dynamic, very well-made film. It looks quite fantastic, it has a large cast of characters that it handles really well, it has its fair share of iconic, memorable moments, and it generally tells a pretty good story. I feel like I wasn't emotionally invested enough to truly love this movie, but I do like it overall. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one."
GoodFellas (1990),Tommy is the only reason that this movie is so likable...,"So Tommy role was given an oscar? Why not it should have been given....i mean wow. I mean Joe just nailed this character. A killing joker was he in his role. The rest of the roles looked meager before his character. Except Jimmy,this movie was more about a loyal wife only...lol. I just cant understand once again that why this movie is so highly rated like Pulp Fiction. The good thing about gangster movies is that if i see one of those,i feel like i have seen all the others...lol. I feel the same about all martin and tarantino's movies.i have seen this movie two times now and i dont wish to see it one more time again.."
GoodFellas (1990),Movie is good,"The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was. ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing. He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City."
GoodFellas (1990),Goodfellas,"This film is a classic. Some even call it a cinematic masterpiece. I would agree this is a wonderful film. Martin Scorsese does great directing this. He really captures the time period very well and makes the viewer really understand the characters as well as makes you feel like you are there during the time period. The film is about a group of 3 friends who work for the mob. Honestly that's the best way to describe the film. Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Paul Sorvino just absolutely kill it in this film. There is no other way to describe it. I would recommend this if you love a good mob classic."
Schindler's List (1993),The profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust,"""Schindler's List"" is a profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust and an ode to the power of individual conscience and compassion in the face of unfathomable evil. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a hauntingly poignant portrayal of one man's transformation from opportunist to savior amidst the atrocities of World War II. The story follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson, who initially seeks to profit from the war by employing Jewish labor in his factories. However, as he witnesses the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews under Nazi rule, Schindler undergoes a moral awakening. His efforts to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish workers, guided by his accountant Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley), become an act of defiance against the inhumanity of the Holocaust. Spielberg's direction captures the harrowing realities of the Holocaust with unflinching authenticity, employing black and white cinematography to evoke a haunting sense of history. The film's stark visuals, coupled with John Williams' haunting score, create an emotionally immersive experience that leaves an indelible impact on the audience. What sets ""Schindler's List"" apart is its unwavering portrayal of both the depths of human cruelty and the glimmer of hope found in acts of altruism. It's a narrative that confronts the darkest chapters of history while honoring the resilience and humanity of those who resisted. The performances, especially Neeson's portrayal of Schindler's gradual transformation from a profiteer to a savior, resonate with emotional depth. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity to the characters, showcasing the resilience and tragedy of those caught in the Holocaust's grip. Beyond its cinematic achievements, ""Schindler's List"" serves as a powerful educational tool, a stark reminder of the consequences of hate and the importance of standing up against injustice. Its impact extends far beyond the screen, challenging viewers to confront the atrocities of the past and champion compassion and tolerance in the present. Decades after its release, the film remains a cinematic landmark-a testament to the filmmaker's dedication to preserving history and telling stories that transcend entertainment, leaving an enduring legacy as a powerful, emotionally raw portrayal of one of humanity's darkest chapters."
Schindler's List (1993),"Schindler, a Righteous Among the Nations","A true movie needs to bring the truth without making it too unreal to the audiece... indeed, many till in our days doubt of the existence of the Holocaust, and Spielberg displays a scenario where many points in the puzzle of the Nazi Germany becomes to be sewed by the story and how love can surpass everything. The man behind the industry (our known elevator), Schindler, challenges his time, and with some diplomats come in history as a man who saved hundreds of jews from the hands of the Gestapo and the SS, and not only that, the catholic Oskar Schindler defies the Vatican's silence (even though I'm not sure the reason for it, maybe because of the Lateran Treaty) and plays a true christian role during that period, I recommed a lot..."
Schindler's List (1993),Truly special.,"The film opens with beautiful black and white cinematography and music in bar as the story gets underway in 1939. I knew right away I was in for a treat. The pictures looks so rich with lovely textures and such an assured style of direction. The picture is 16:9 with, with great clarity and sharpness. You find out very quickly it's going to be an English language film but you quickly forget about whether characters would be speaking German, English or Polish. This manages to be a very intimate personal film and yet also a film of great scale with huge sets and hundreds of extras. The acting is superb, very strong and it chillingly shows the casual cold ruthlessness of Nazi soldiers and spies. It also sets up this interesting and powerful tug of war and battle of wills between the two key characters. One is almost a kind of beast, a man who kills for pleasure, the other we are uncertain at first about, a war profiter and a rationalist or a humanitarian who is working subtly to undermine Nazi efforts. Ben Kingsley also deserves a lot of praise for his performance too. Some of the cinematography I really can't stress enough how good it is, a character who catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and the powerful effect of that, it's just superb filmmaking. This is a film with plenty of reality, there's no dashing Indiana Jones character who's going to come racing in on his horse, blast away all the bad guys, kiss the girl and save the day. Nope here this really is a film about horror and hope in the face of despair. The film towards the end also offers a great sense of reflection and perspective and wonderfully questions the actual value of money over the alternative of saving someone's life. The ending is superbly moving, I can't rate this highly enough."
Schindler's List (1993),Krakow trip,"I've seen Schindlers List before, and I've always had an interest in WW2. Me and my now fiancé have just got back from a trip to Krakow which obviously involved a trip to Auschwitz and Oskar Schindlers factory so we rewatched this film before going. As a 30 year old writing this and having seen Liam Neesons latest films (Taken etc) which I like, it's mad to see him in a film (where he looks no older!) which was brought out the year I was born. He's 70 now Neeson and doesn't seem to be slowing down. I do think however his career and the opinion of him as an actor in the public eye has diminished slightly since Schindlers list there's no doubt he does an amazing job in this. As does, Ralph Fiennes who is only 30 at the time! He completely transforms into this psychotic German madman with a thirst for power and filled with hatred. Ben Kingsley does a great job as Isaac stern also. It shows the horrors of the German SS and especially the scenes where the woman is telling them the foundations are wrong where executed, even though her opinion was correct always sticks in my mind. It is great to see Schindler turn from being all about the money in the beginning to actually caring about the Jews and us seeing him become more compassionate as a person as the film goes on. Having been to his factory as well know it brings it all to life, and I have the upmost respect for him and what he did."
Schindler's List (1993),Better than 12 Angry Men even...,"I guess this movie is better than 12 Angry Men even... i had declared 12 Angry Men to be the best movie on IMDB list earlier. But i hadn't rewatched Schindler's list till then. I saw it right after 12 Angry Men on the same day. And Oh My God...It just took my head into its strong grip. We need to be human first in order to see this movie. This movie is beyond the boundaries of race,class or religion. This is just about humanity,its suffering and its endurance against violence,torture and brutality. Violence should be condemned no matter against whom it is being done. Bcz humanity is above all tags..."
Schindler's List (1993),Haunting masterpiece: a must-watch exploration of humanity's darkest and brightest corners,"Moving. Disturbing. Devastating. Horrific. A masterpiece film that everyone needs to watch at least once in their lifetime. Incredibly power storytelling. Outstanding performances. A testament to how mankind can be insanely evil, viciously cruel in through their antisemitism discrimination and treating humans like animals, and exploiting them to their death, and killing them in cold blood. While on the opposite side, mankind can exude unwavering compassion, good faith, and selflessness to save the lives of as many people as they can as what Oskar Schindler strived to do and accomplished as much as he could. The ending scene never fails to make me cry. A necessary must-watch film."
Schindler's List (1993),"Amazing Cinematography, Great Lead Character","This movie didn't hit me like so many others. I know the story and see what it shows. It does very well, but not entirely to my taste. What captivated me though was the main character - played very well by Liam Neeson, Oskar Schindler is sophisticated, charming, empathetic, kind, smart. Overall - super good dude! A dude who should be an example to many of us. Steals the whole show outright. Cinematography can not forget - brilliant performance by Janusz Kaminskiand, no less brilliant on the part of Steven Spielberg. It's a long film, keep in mind, and while it's not for everyone, given the attention span of people today, it's shot and recreated very easily to watch and the running time doesn't feel at all. As an addendum to all of the above - the character of Ralph Fiennes is also very interesting, has plenty of screen time, is played superbly and despite his cruelty, the character himself is slightly humorous, which is very original to do for a film like this, and very difficult for it to fit the story so well. Final score: 8/10."
Schindler's List (1993),"""DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING""","""THE ONE WHO SAVES ONE PERSON'S LIFE ACTUALLY SAVES THE WHOLE WORLD"" When the movie ended, I was still under its influence, I think it will be like that for a long time, because it was a movie that shook my psychology completely. I also watched Life is Beautiful and The Pianist, which were my favorite movies, which depicted the Jewish Massacre very successfully. I watched it. However, the reality in this movie impressed me completely. It has been talked about for years and is still being talked about. The Jews are guilty like this, the Germans are right like that. Jews, Serbians, Muslims, Germans, Turks, Christians, whatever it is, it goes on and on, but which human being deserves this treatment? How is this? It is an atrocity. What justifies these actions? I don't understand what kind of mental state it is, to kill an unarmed, defenseless person without blinking an eye, and then to continue living as if nothing had happened. Neither the memories of the people whose memories are respected, nor the dead... Isn't it God who created them too? .. But there were those among them who had a conscience, like Oscar Schindler. The path he followed is still being debated by some groups. It is said, 'The man thought about his own labor force, capital and earnings', yes, the man thought about himself, but besides that, he saved as many people as he could and is indifferent to this inhumane treatment like the others. At least there are no more. What can I say? I wish there had never been wars, so many innocent and defenseless people had never died. If children had lived in a more colorful and innocent world. Other people have always suffered the sins of greedy, conscienceless dictators, and still do... The world has never It wasn't fair anyway.... Let me end it here, I think it's ""DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING"""

Catch Me If You Can (2002),The Ultimate Con Man,"This movie was fun to watch. It's a rewatch but I watched it so many years ago it needed a rewatch before it left Netflix. Young Dicaprio was such a good cast for this role although the real Frank Abagnale was not quite as charming. Any movie with Leo is a plus for me. The score done by John Williams was very good and I was appreciative of the several jazz tracks they used throughout the film. Christopher Walken was also very good in his supporting role and you can see the influence he had on in his junior. The whole movie is great (perhaps even a 4.5) as long as you suspend your disbelief which became very hard to do. The movie for many years was thought as based on true story but recent investigations have suggested that most of the movie, which is based on Abagnale's autobiography, is false and fabricated. It's a type of story so unrealistic and movie-like that it can only work if it actually happened. But this knowledge made the movie a little pointless in hindsight and only confirmed the impossibility of such scams done by Abagnale. Outside of the thrilling moments portrayed by Dicaprio's charm, this movie shows you why you shouldn't get divorced. Look how a normal kid turned into a con man in a matter of days. Perhaps the biggest con that Abagnale pulled off is making the world believe that you are biggest con man and profit off of it. It's truly a great gimmick and I respect him for running that. At the very least, he's a good story writer/teller, which means something."
Catch Me If You Can (2002),A strong Spielberg Film,"Score - 78% 'A true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. Who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor. An FBI agent makes it his mission to put him behind bars. But Frank not only eludes capture, he revels in the pursuit.'
This one was very good. Many call it an underrated Spielberg film and I thought that there was a lot of fun to be had. The film is not perfect however, there are some flaws. In this review I will dive into what worked for me, and the few things that didn't work for me. To begin with that opening scene, I think that this was a directorial choice by Spielberg, that didn't fully work. In the opening scene, you see almost the end of the story, and then cut back. I think that this almost took away from the moment when he was captured, because there was no doubt in our minds that he would be captured. I think that it would have been better if the moment was recontextualised later. However, I did quite like how Spielberg keeps going back to this moment, and we are able to see what these characters think of what they did in the past. Spielberg for the rest of the film is great, giving the film its own unique feel, and creating the perfect level of mystery. We are also introduced to our two leads here, Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale Jr. And Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, our detective. Leo really showed himself here, and I think this performance was one of the reasons why he is so famous today. He plays a man who was once so confident, and then turns into scared and acceptance of his capture later on. Tom Hanks is the standout however, he plays such a serious character. He is so focussed on this case that we see it so well, and he proves yet again why he is one of the best in Hollywood. The first act really dives into the set up for the film, as we see why Leo does what he does. There are some great scenes in here, particularly the school scene, that is quite iconic. I think that the two parents, played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye were great. They conveyed such emotion in this film, Walken played a character trying to look so strong, but really is falling apart. I this that this groundwork is so important here, and I am so glad that Spielberg kept in these scenes. One of my issues is that I do not fully buy into Leo's character's motivation. I understand that he feels lost, but I don't fully buy it. I might be missing something, but the running away feels out of nowhere for me. I did enjoy seeing Leo's turn, as we have some montages that were enjoyable. Also, the sets and costumes for the planes and character designs were super great and a special shout out should go to Jeannine Oppewall and Mary Zophres. The second act is when we saw Tom Hanks come in. I think that this makes the film take a great turn for the better, as it creates a cat and mouse feel. Any scene with Hanks in were the standout scenes, and seeing him figure out the mystery was stunning. Out focus was on Leo, and I wish we saw just a bit more of Hanks. One of the standout scenes in here was one where we thought Leo was found, but he works his way out of it in a great way. Leo's story was enjoyable, as we begin to see how this life isn't enjoyable for him. He tries to settle down with Amy Adam's character of Brenda Strong. She was so innocent, and it was so hard to watch as she found out that Leo is actually a fraud. The pacing was really good in here, as when you think it is about to drop, you get a Hanks scene and you are back into it. One scene when Hanks thinks he has found Leo, but actually hasn't and you see Leo leave was so great, and I loved Spielberg's direction in here. One other thing that I would like to mention as I feel like the cinematography could be a bit better. I think that Janusz Kaminski could have done a better job. The third act sees Leo leave it all and fully commit. There was a scene of him really showing his fraud in a university that was fun to watch. We see Leo's capture after this, and it feels great for Hanks to catch him, it was so satisfying
We actually see a bond between Hanks and Leo, which I wasn't expecting. It was enjoyable, but I wasn't expecting it. I don't know if it was necessary but it does finish Hanks' arc in a nice way. However, the end point feels a bit generic, and I don't like the text on the screen. Overall, this film has a lot of good, particularly the performances, direction, second act and pacing. It has some issues, notably Leo's motivation, a generic ending and I would have liked to see a bit more Hanks in here My score is:
Plot - 7/10
First Act - 8/10
Second Act - 9/10
Third Act - 7/10
Acting - 9/10
Characters - 7/10

Catch Me If You Can (2002),"A fun movie, it doesn't have to be more than that","Based on a true story - allegedly - Catch Me If You Can combine drama and comedy flawlessly, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio bring different energy to their respective roles in this cat-and-mouse Steven Spielberg blockbuster. The film is a classic good detective, smart criminal frenemy story. The detective obsesses over catching the criminal, even disobeying orders in the process until he finally does it; everyone learns their lesson, and the case is closed, so Catch Me If You Can is not getting any points for originality on my part. Despite its lack of innovation, performances by lead actors Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding as per usual. Let's not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr whose brilliant performance earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the Academy Awards. On another note the score is memorable, and the cinematography is good. Definitely not an art-house - as evidenced by the lack of nominations for major awards - but it doesn't have to be. Catch Me If You Can is still a fun watch."

DiCaprio shines as Frank Abagnale Jr., a master of deception who successfully eludes the authorities by assuming various identities and forging checks. His charisma and quick thinking make him an incredibly engaging character, leaving the audience torn between rooting for him and the FBI agent hot on his trail. Tom Hanks, as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, provides the perfect foil to DiCaprio's character. The dynamic between the two leads is the heart of the film, delivering moments of tension, camaraderie, and unexpected humor. Hanks brings a gravitas to the role, portraying Hanratty as a determined and sympathetic character whose pursuit becomes more than just a job. Spielberg's direction is impeccable, balancing the fast-paced nature of the story with moments of reflection and introspection. The film captures the essence of the 1960s with its stylish cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the era. One of the film's strengths is its ability to navigate between lighthearted comedy and intense drama effortlessly. The humor derived from Frank's audacious cons provides a welcome break from the tension, making ""Catch Me If You Can"" a thoroughly enjoyable and well-rounded experience. The supporting cast, including Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, adds depth to the narrative, contributing to the emotional core of the story. Walken, in particular, delivers a poignant performance as Frank Abagnale Sr., adding layers to the protagonist's character.

Catch Me If You Can (2002),I love it!,"Despite being often overlooked, this Spielberg movie is a hidden gem that is worth watching. Unlike other films that belong to a big franchise or revolutionize the cinema industry, this one is a well-crafted story. Spielberg's direction of this cat-and-mouse game is captivating, leaving me hooked from start to finish. The dialogue, music, and direction all work together seamlessly and to great effect. Spielberg's unique camera angles and actor positioning create perfect scenes. Both DiCaprio and Hanks deliver fantastic performances, making this heartwarming and energetic film one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion."
Catch Me If You Can (2002),I still like it,"This film isn't totally true to the book, but as we now know, the book is not totally true either! I suppose it's hard to be too upset at a con man lying. That's what they do. Compulsively. For profit. The film (and the book) don't really explore the motives behind the lies. Like why didn't the bright young man study and train to be a pilot? Because he had no respect for Pilots, or anybody. Everyone was his plaything. His tale is one of style, not substance. So I didn't mind the playful way Spielberg portrayed him. It's still a fine movie. I even read the book again recently and still enjoyed that too. But would the book have been published if it was submitted as a novel? Chuck Barris, James Frey and others have confessed to lying in their books. It's time Abagnale did the same. But there's the rub, who would believe a con artist?"
Catch Me If You Can (2002),Admiring...,"Every time I board a plane, this film comes to my mind. It happened again, and I watched it again. The downside of watching such legendary films and magnificent performances is that we see fewer stories and actor performances of this quality over time. Tom Hanks is magnificent, Leo is great, and all the other actors present a recital. The fact that a true story can be so incredible is a whole other matter. Admiring a character I admired as a child 20 years later is, I guess, the emotional aspect of the matter... Probably I'm goint watch again 15 years later and Im going feel same like today..."
Catch Me If You Can (2002),Enjoyable movie but not much else,"As the title above stated this movie is enjoyable but not much else. It really feels like some of the scenes are added on for more padding and to make the movie longer which is rather odd considering it probably would've been better without the excess fat. Performances are very good with a star studded cast as expected from these names, both DiCaprio and Hanks deliver fantastic performances in their respective roles which make their characters be a lot of believable. Despite the padding the movie itself kind of feels flat, especially when you put the whole background story for Frank and he's still rather empty as a character."
Catch Me If You Can (2002),Catch Me If You Can (2002) Spielberg's most overrated film?,"A film directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Just with these details it is possible to imagine that there is no way to make a bad film. It is actually a very good film and very well executed, with great performances and very competent direction. However, perhaps it is not as great a film as some think. It's a very interesting and fun film, but it probably doesn't make it into the top ten of these three movie stars. The story is cool, but there's nothing that incredible about it. The characters don't draw that much attention, even though they are real people. The pacing is good and the film ends in the blink of an eye. Something that bothers me a lot is the film's photography, which isn't as beautiful as the director's other films. Still, it's impossible to say that this film is bad. It's worth watching."
Catch Me If You Can (2002),DiCaprio Epic,"The movie has a very slow start to it, but as it starts to develop there are some classic scenes. The one with Frank essentially being caught and handing his wallet to the detective as evidence for his credentials is Leo at his finest and probably the most famous from the movie. Often nowadays you are lucky to get one good performance in a movie, but in this you get all around great performances where they feed off one another. The ending is one that is very satisfying and I can't imagine many regretting their decision to watch the movie. An interesting aspect to this movie is that you don't even really have a villain and yet it still has great intrigue. There's good reason to be rooting for Hanks character as well ass for Leo's next trick."
House of Gucci (2021),JARED 😍😍😍,"House of Gucci is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the screen, and Jared Leto's performance is an absolute triumph. Leto's portrayal of Paolo Gucci is nothing short of mesmerizing, as he effortlessly embodies the eccentricities and complexities of the character. From his flamboyant wardrobe to his distinct accent, Leto steals every scene with his magnetic presence. The actor's commitment to the role is evident, showcasing a transformative performance that showcases his versatility and dedication to his craft. Leto's ability to balance humor with the underlying tragedy in Paolo's life adds depth to the character, making him both endearing and pitiable. His chemistry with the rest of the cast, particularly Lady Gaga, is palpable, creating moments of genuine emotion that resonate throughout the film. House of Gucci, as a whole, benefits greatly from Leto's standout performance. The movie's narrative, filled with intrigue, betrayal, and family drama, is elevated by the authenticity Leto brings to his character. His ability to capture the essence of Paolo adds layers to the storytelling, making the audience empathize with a character who could easily be dismissed as a caricature. The film's production design, costumes, and overall aesthetic are enhanced by Leto's commitment to fully immersing himself in the role. As a Jared Leto obsessed fan, witnessing his transformative prowess on screen is a thrilling experience. House of Gucci not only entertains but also leaves a lasting impression, thanks in no small part to Leto's brilliant performance. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of acting and the magnetic allure of one of Hollywood's most dedicated talents."
House of Gucci (2021),"Great fun film, Lady GaGa owns it ...","Interesting film, worth a watch and like all these things, how much if this is based on fact or fiction, who will ever know. Great fun and Lady GaGa smashes her role with her usual passion and ultimate professionalism. A much better actress than a singer, but what do I know? Adam driver plays a good part bouncing off Lady GaGa adding real value to the plot. Al Pacino clearly loved his character as he shines also . Some amazing settings and a dash of good humour mask the pain of the story and the love twist embedded in the corporate turmoil which unfolds before our eyes. I have never been a fan of Gucci style, But I loved the film."
House of Gucci (2021),Italian family speaking English with eachother with Italian accent! Why?,"Ok, you are going to say ""this movie is intended for internaional viewers and mostly for Anericans"" but I still don't see a point of Italian people talking to eachother in English with an Italian accent and even worse, using basic words in Italian like ""ciao, si"" in between sentences. If the director wants us to assume they are actually speaking Italian but we are hearing them in English, then why the accent and Italian words? This removes the sense of reality. This annoyed me so much during the movie. Other than that, Lady Gaga is not a good actress. Please stop trying to convince us that she is. Her overacting is making every movie she is in a school play."
House of Gucci (2021),A one dimensional affair,"House of Gucci is lovely to look at, the cars, the scenery and of course the clothes are opulent and fitting. The film is a very strange affair. It is a film with very little depth and indeed the whole thing is like watching a recap of a story. The family is pretty much unlikeable and appear quite mad. Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons are two Gucci brothers and we don't really know much about them. It seems that the brother Irons plays left the business to follow a film career and Pacino stayed to run the Gucci business. I am reminded of ""All About Eve"", this film is similar in a way but far inferior. Lady Gaga is portrayed as a manipulator and perhaps gold digger. I found her to be those maybe but also a headstrong woman who had a plan. Nothing really wrong with that. It's all very weak, limp even
No highlights at all , unfortunately."
House of Gucci (2021),Excellent performance from Lady Gaga,"I really enjoyed this film; it was my wife's choice, and I was not too sure but there are some great performances. There is an excellent cast, Lady Gaga, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Salma Hayek. The story of blinding ambition, betrayal and murder, Patrizia looking for a rich husband and meets the naive Maurizio Gucci the heir to the Gucci empire. Her ambition burns bright having Maurizio reconcile with his dying father and then setting out to destroy the rest of the family and take charge of the Empire. Unfortunately, Maurizio is more of a playboy than a CEO, he meets an old female friend and separates from his wife and she plots to have him killed, really enjoyable movie."
House of Gucci (2021),AWFUL !!,"This is absolutely awful. I thought I was going to watch a good true life film about the Gucci family and the downfall of the brand. Instead it was like a comedy in parts and kept switching scenes which didn't gel together. The fake Italian accents are dreadful and the English actors sometimes revert back to an English accent. Keep an eye on the red wine they drink - it looks like diluted Ribena!! Why produce a film with English / American actors using dreadful Italian accents and then in parts such as greetings of hello or goodbye they speak in Italian !! What's the point of that. Acting is very poor, and if I were any member of the Gucci family I would he horrified to see my family portrayed in this way. It could have been so good because the actual facts of this story are film worthy, and not making a mockery of the House of Gucci. Don't bother watching!"
House of Gucci (2021),Death of a Cyclist,"Although now in his eighties, Ridley Scott - as his curt responses to critic of 'Napoleon' have recently demonstrated - is certainly showing no signs of mellowing. Here he turns his attention to the sort of Eurotrash with more money than sense with the same sardonic eye as Fellini. Despite the rather grandiose title nobody actually seems to be taking it terribly seriously, the portrayals are inclined to be rather broad and with the casting of Al Pacino - which prompts associations with 'The Godfather' - we don't expect the characterisation to be terribly nuanced, while Lady Gaga make a startling brunette with an even more startling Italian accent and Egyptian eyeliner."
House of Gucci (2021),"in the past few years, Ridley Scott has developed a knack for movies about screwed-up families","Ridley Scott has been a prominent director for decades, having turned out ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Gladiator"". In 2017, he released ""All the Money in the World"", about the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty's grandson. A lot of what the movie showed was how there was no love in that family; Getty cared only about his wealth. More recently, Scott gave us ""House of Gucci"", about the ugly goings-on behind the scenes of the famous fashion house. I had never known about any of this. It's hard to tell if Patrizia Reggiani was simply a gold-digger or if she actually felt affection for Maurizio Gucci. Either way, these were some of the most screwed-up people of all time. I guess that's often the case with the rich and famous. The movie apparently drew criticism for the cast's uneven accents and odd makeup work. I thought that they did a good job. If you only know Lady Gaga for her outrageous outfits, then you'll be impressed with her no-nonsense performance as Patrizia, as well as Adam Driver as Maurizio, Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo, Al Pacino as Aldo, and Jared Leto as Paolo. Worth seeing."
House of Gucci (2021),Really enjoyable with great cast and acting.,"Well, you won't believe it, but I didn't have high hopes for this flick at all. I only gave it a shot because Netflix was like, ""Hey, you might like this!"" And guess what? It totally blew me away. The plot? Oh, it's killer! Plus, the cast is top-notch, and their acting is on point. Let's talk about Adam Driver, shall we? That dude's delivery is just perfection. He manages to be all confident and at the same time, he shows some real vulnerability. It's like, ""Dude, are you for real?"" And yeah, it's totally believable and just pulls you in. Now, Lady Gaga? I mean, I've never been a fan of her or her music, but she surprised the heck out of me with her performance. It's seriously terrific. And Jared Leto? He brings the laughs and adds some warmth to his character, even though the guy's a total goofball. But he's a lovable goofball, you know what I mean? Al Pacino? He dials down his usual craziness just the right amount. And Jeremy Irons? Perfect, man. His character here kinda reminds me of his role in Margin Call. The pacing? Nailed it. I couldn't wait for each episode to drop. This movie was a pleasant surprise, no doubt about it!"
House of Gucci (2021),Big-company basics,"This story about Gucci, a European cloth-making conglomerate caught the audience with a surprise; as most if not all family organizations tend to be private about their come-up. Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) is the point-guard in a checks-and-balance closely deputized by Aldo (Al Pacino) who is more hands-on with the dailies. They each have sons, Maurizio (Adam Driver) and Paolo (Jared Leto) respectively. Completely different personalities. Maurizio marries a conniving and calculating Patrizia (Lady Gaga) who stirs up and tests the family ties as correctly foreseen by Rodolfo. After the death of his father, Patrizia has Maurizio severe his family ties by tricking his cousin to sell their company shares after having him send his father to jail for tax evasion. This film follows a unique yet somewhat common story about how strong family businesses can be simply brought down by human vices such as greed and pride. The cast delivered. Had no idea of Ridley Scott's directorship and in retrospect explains its unique storytelling and amazing angles."
Nyad (2023),Puff Piece to Prop Up a Phony,"Wow what a tedious, boring bit of garbage. Fact is this puff piece wasn't made because Nyad is some hero. Nyad isnt even her name. I'll get to that. If you watch this movie you'll know exactly why it was made and who supports it. And if you are still unclear look her up on the internet. It's another one of THOSE movies. Only she's a complete phony that a group wants to deify. Diana Nyad is actually Diana Sneed. Nyad isnt even her stepfather's real last name! It was Notaras. In fact, during the credits the REAL Bonnie tell the audience at some event ever to believe a thing that Nyad says! What? At least SHE's honest. Her swim was never acknowledged so why the movie? Already told you. But OMG they decided to make the most boring film on earth. She comes across as a completely entitled, self-absorbed, unlikable person who has zero care or compassion for anyone but herself. And it's all for naught because she never succeeded, no matter what this movie tries to wrongly portray. Her entire life is built on sand. It's phony as the day is long. And if you can make it thru this debacle, you will be praying you can get your time back. You can't. Don't bother."
Nyad (2023),Decent movie out of the usual mediocre/bad Netflix movie,"This is a laidback style yet somewhat inspirational movie about a woman who is in her 60s suddenly decided to swim across the open ocean between Cuba and Florida to prove herself she could do this despite her age and to reach her long lost dream. I'm not sure how exaggerated or accurate the storyline is, but I felt the main contributing factor for her multiple failures to be able to swim between Cuba and Florida was not because of her lack of physical skills, but rather because of her massive egos and how she didn't listen to or respect others inputs. She ended up overcoming this god complex she possessed towards the very end but this main character woman is quite unlikable around 90% of the time in the movie; how she treated people around her so poorly and so disrespectfully, like everyone was beneath her, including her best friend (played by Jodie Foster). It was off-putting the main character thought the world revolved around her to such degree. To me her narcissistic behaviors exhibited and attitudes towards others were just unacceptable. This isn't acceptable for any athlete or aspiring athlete to treat people like this who were trying to help her. Certain aspects of the film, what it took to swim being surrounded by poisonous jellyfish or consuming food or taking medications while in the sea or what the mental state of mind she would become due to exhaustion swimming such long distance were quite eye opening and interesting aspects of the movie we don't see everyday. Overall an interesting movie worthy of watching and acting was pretty good (though the film itself is not 9 or 10...). Just that the main character was very unlikable and if any athletes are this narcissistic they should not be allowed or welcomed to represent anything let alone women. As a woman I felt embarrassed how she treated everybody around her 90% of the time in the movie."
Nyad (2023),Amazing portrayal of how powerful a dream is.,This movie is so inspiring! I really loved the portrayal of Diane and Jodie plays such a great supporting role. I would recommend everyone see this as a must-see end of the year movie; it will really get your spirit lifted and remind you of how powerful a dream can really be. This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like you really can get up and reclaim your life and continue a voyage to complete a goal - even if you need to take a pit stop once in a while along the way. It's the kind of movie that renews your faith in possibility and that's something we could all use a lot more of in cinema these days.
Nyad (2023),Middlebrow Inspirational Sports Story,"""Nyad"" is an uninspired, middlebrow inspirational sports story, but there's a place for movies like this. The story itself is very compelling, so even if the execution is bland, the movie stays fairly engaging anyway. The film's biggest assets are its two main actors, Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, who have a ton of chemistry as life-long friends and the titular swimming phenom and her coach, respectively. Foster especially gives a spunky performance and has the more interesting character, having to balance moral support for her friend's obsessive ambitions with genuine concern for her life, and face the prospect of being an accomplice in her death. I obviously wasn't paying attention to the news, because despite this happening not that long ago, I have no recollection of this story. Grade: B+"
Nyad (2023),"Hey you. Yeah you, keep going!","Based on the autobiography Find a way, narrates the story of swimmer Diana Nyad and her attempts to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage, facing all the odds. It presents the account of her personal life, the impact of a serious crime had on her and how she fought her way back. The kind of stubborn person she is, who never gives up and the team that made sure she achieved her goal through the five attempts. This indeed was an inspiring tale of not just one woman but her entire team who stood by her, safeguarding and motivating her, backing her never give up attitude. Annette Bening is aptly cast in the role of Diana Nyad and she perfectly captures the character's various emotions throughout, can even say lived this character which again applies to Jodie Foster playing Bonnie the best friend. The narrative sticks to linear narrative as far as the swimming portions go and giving flashbacks of the past that took a toll on the child yet she ensured it didn't stop her from growing up to be the person she aimed to be. The highlight was the final moments and ofcourse the footage of the real people in the end."
Nyad (2023),admirable acting,"I am far to be admirer of sports films. I admitt, I was real ignorant about name and swiming activity of Diana Nyad. But the presence of Jodie Foster and Annette Bening was just enough for see the film. And their acting, their honest define of characters, the fair craft of relation steps are a real precious gift offered by director. Maybe not exactly about sport , but about determination, ambition, courage, forms of tenacity to craziness, dark memories and five attempts and magnificent team work and support is this beautiful film about two women and their life together. And, sure, about their battles. Unfair to ignore the inspired work of Rhys Ifans. In short, a film deserving to be discovered ."
Nyad (2023),A testament of courage,"This movie based on a true stoty of the strength and unrelenting determination of Diana Nyad a well documented swimmer and athlete. The film based on a true story of the journey and attempts by Nyad to swim from cuba to keywest Florida. So many crushing blows as se eral unsuccessful attempts to make this swimming marathon while battling mother nature and the extreme conditions of this stretch of ocean
If you're a fan of Jodie Foster then you will love her in this film. No one has ever accomplished what Diana Nyad done making this remarkable swim from Cuba to Keywest and doing it at age 64. Highly recommend this film."
Nyad (2023),The long-distance swim from Cuba to Florida.,"I remember Diana Nyad and her swimming exploits over the years, she and I are almost the same age. This movie is about her quest to swim, non-stop, from Havana, Cuba to Key West, Florida. She had tried it and failed years earlier, when she was 28. Now in her 60s, she was determined to complete it, she felt physically strong enough and better prepared mentally than she had been earlier. The producers made excellent selections, Annette Bening is Diana Nyad and Jodie Foster is her close friend, and coach, Bonnie Stoll. The movie runs right at 2 hours, both my wife and I were wishing it had been a bit shorter, maybe 90 minutes. But we stuck with it and it is an excellent movie. At home, streaming on Netflix. In addition to her preparations for the big swim, the movie also has several flash backs to Diana as a teenager and swimming prodigy of sorts. Plus a less than welcome relationship with her coach at the time. Good movie of interesting characters and interesting events."
Nyad (2023),"Annette and Jodie do a perfect job, not that I would expect otherwise","I first learned of Diana Nyad when she successfully swam from Cuba to Florida in 2013, and the report mentioned that she had tried it before and failed. So, we now have ""Nyad"", starring Annette Bening as the swimmer and Jodie Foster as her partner Bonnie. Decidedly unglamorous in their roles, they show the pair's trials and tribulations as Diana pushes forward with her determination to accomplish her dream. Maybe the movie overplayed their personal issues, but Bening's and Foster's performances more than make up for everything. This is definitely the sort of movie that everyone should see. I hope that it earns a lot of recognition."
Nyad (2023),Loved it!,"Annette and Jodie are phenomenal in this! Love how they show some raw footage. I didn't know anything about Diana Nyad until this movie and now I know everything I need to know. It's thorough and not boring. Not sure why this doesn't have a higher rating. I was looking up the real facts during the movie because I wanted to see more on the real people. It was a feel good inspiring story. It's truly incredible what she accomplished and her determination. If you like a good documentary type movie, this is definitely one to add to your list. I would love to see more movies like this one. 10 out of 10 for me."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),A Story about a story.,"'Finding Neverland' was based on writer J. M. Barrie's conception and writing of 'Peter Pan'. 'The Man who invented Christmas' is based on Charles Dickens writing 'A Christmas Carol'. Unfortunately, as well made as 'The Man who invented Christmas' is, I didn't find it as interesting as 'Finding Neverland'. In fact, I found it rather boring. If it wasn't for the marvelous performance by Dan Stevens, I might have stopped watching. Dan Stevens stars as writer Charles Dickens. After the success of 'Oliver Twist', he was on top of the world, attending endless balls, dinners, speeches, and parties. However, with his next three books being flops, he was running out of money - and had run out of ideas for another novel. When he finally came up with an idea for his next book - partly thanks to his new servant girl Tara - he finds it difficult to write with constant interference from his family. With a fast approaching deadline, time is of the essence. Why did I find the movie as boring as I did? Too much talk maybe? Or possibly because the premise didn't interest me? Maybe also because the film was too predictable. I mean, we all know he managed to publish the book. The film depicts his journey from the creation of the main character, Scrooge, to developing and writing the story, and then self-publishing it. 'The Man who invented Christmas' is a well made film with elements of fantasy, drama and subtle humour. I did enjoy the feel-good ending, but the film as a whole was a tad too boring for my liking. Also note, this is not a Christmas movie - as I thought - and actually has very little to do with Christmas."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),The most unique retelling of the ultimate Christmas staple.,"What a delight to find this, an inside look at the life of legendary author Charles Dickens who along with Mark Twain and Shakespeare are probably the only writers known by everyone alive just by name. This lighthearted drama stars the charming Dan Stevens as Dickens, then in his early 30's and already a literary star for ""Oliver Twist"", preparing to write ""A Christmas Carol"" after a few disappointments. The creation of the title is just one of the elements of the plot (someone suggests ""White Christmas:), with the most famous lines taken from what he hears from the heartless upperclass men he deals with on a daily basis as the industrial age had helped remove the Christmas spirit from much of the surplus population. The ancient waiter with a hump has the name of Marley and wheezes as he takes Charles' order. An old wrinkled man in a top hat and sneer hisses ""Humbug!"" as he passes by. A money lender rattles chains while discussing business. Soon Charles is fantasizing about interacting with all of these characters, with the legendary Christopher Plummer playing Ebenezer. Soon Scrooge is showing up to guide him on details, and the creative process and character development really blends. There's been nothing I'm aware of on the life of Charles Dickens so to see him as a young man and not an imperious elder statesman is fascinating. There's hints of many of Dickens' famous characters inside the supporting players, with some fabulous well known character actors in lovely bits. Stevens truly becomes the young Dickens, taking the viewer into his private life, including when his wife (who has already given birth to several) tells him she's expecting once again. The mind of a creator (which includes an interview with the original illustrator) is fascinating study. Plummer adds another sensational character here, showing Scrooge desiring to be presented as more than a one dimensional miser. Bah brilliant!"
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),Is this truly an insight in to Charles Dickens creative process ?,"Did Charles Dickens have imaginaty friends and enemies who became his characters ? He talked them and they talked to him with words that he actually heard chance people say. They themselves suggested the stories and then he just wrote them down. There really was a Martin Chuzzlewit and a person named Bob Marley. Once he had the name Scrooge composite of all too many people he met became the character. Oh do, do say that this was actually the way it was to give needed hope and inspiration to many a developing writer ! He drew inspiration from all around himself. Was a
He actually in a mizerable apprenticeship. Was his Father Mr. Mcawber ? I hope that tis true. As many times as I have seen Christmas carol in so many versions, I admit that this version did make me cry, I dont know why."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),I'm so glad I found this movie,"While searching for a decent Christmas movie to watch this popped up. Since I am a huge fan of Dickens' Christmas Carol I thought I'd give it a watch. So glad I did. Every year we watch the Reginald Owen 1938 version, the Alastair Sim version & the George C Scott version. The Man Who Invented Christmas will be added to that list. I knew a bit about the life of Dickens; the way this merged his past & present, his reality and his fantasy was very entertaining. All the actors were wonderful in their roles and the portrayal of the life of Dickens superimposed with the life of Scrooge was entertaining. This movie ticked all the boxes. Highly recommended."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),Excellent Christmas story,"I enjoyed this movie and the cast was excellent. Dan Steven's was wonderful as Charles Dickens, I loved his struggles in bringing the characters to life and the room full of them talking among themselves. Jonathan Pryce was very believable as his Dad, a ne're do well who leads a troubled life while ever hopeful things will be better. He's actually a little bit of a con man and he and Charles aren't on good terms. The stand out actor was Christopher Plummer as Scrooge, a stellar performance as usual. The friend, Justin Edward's, was the glue that held Charles together and always supported him. The story gives us a look into this period in history and the struggles that the poor families faced, especially children who were forced to work in the poor house. Also how many of the wealthy class felt as if you were poor you had no value except to work as their underpaid servants. I am going to watch it with my Grandchildren and I hope they enjoy it as much as I did. This is a feel good story that I hope will become a Christmas classic. ."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),A traditional delight!,"What is not to like here? A delightful period gem with some top quality actors in the billing - including the magnificent Miriam Margoyles. I absolutely love Dan Stevens, he has an exquisite way of presenting himself, with a hint of twinkle! Loved the storyline of how the classic characters of ""A Christmas Carol"" came to be, really very interesting and, if true, an insight into the author of whom I didn't know much before. I adored the little quirks and references, such as the policeman called Copperfield. Beautiful film set as well, seemed like a quality production. It has certainly entertained me on a wintery evening infront of the fire and the Christmas tree and got me nicely in the mood for the festive season. Will definitely watch again."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),A Good Movie about the Origins of Current Day Christmas,"The Man Who Invented Christmas is an interesting story about a real author. The movie showcases author Charles Dickens putting himself in the role of his character to help make the story. This movie takes place during a time where Christmas isn't such a big holiday as it is today. Dickens writing the story of A Christmas Carol definitely helps revolutionize the holiday. A Christmas Carol does create the term of Scrooge (i.e. People could call someone else a Scrooge if they're not entirely in the Christmas spirit). It may help bring Christmas movies to life when it gets time to the 1900s. A Christmas Carol can be pretty impactful and this movie definitely brings its creation to life, so I recommend it if you want to know more about Christmas and why it's such a big holiday. This movie might not be a lot, but still."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),CHRISTMAS Is The Worst Time of the Year for Me,"This may be a splendid film. With the storyline being the extraordinary journey of how one of the most classic works in literature came to life, it is a powerful and inspiring film for anyone to watch. I myself am a writer (I mainly write short stories) and the adventure of how the literary characters came to life is astonishing. These kind of films are truly inspiring and has proven to have the power to make viewers create new ideas. Many generations of viewers can learn new things from biopics. I love biopics. Each cast member committed fully to their characters and to the storyline of the film. I really enjoy watching biopics, and this film is one-of-a-kind. Although, with this film being all good, Christmas is a tormenting period for me. As a matter of fact, I hate Christmas. One experience can destroy something for someone, and that is exactly what happened to me. For years, it has haunted me."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),Excellently magnifies the theme of A Christmas Carol,"The movie makes the underlying theme of the book -- redemption through spiritual enlightenment of even the most inherent personal flaws -- more beautiful and clear by showing that Dickens had similarities to Scrooge. It also reveals that writers often work out their personal struggles through the characters and story lines of their works. Because of this, it makes the viewer relate the theme to the viewer's own life. I adored this movie. A wonderful Christmas treat that made the classic tale more lovable than ever. Anyone who loved the book should see this movie. It will make them see the book in sharper relief."
The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017),Wonderfull,"I never imagined that a film about a writer could be so good. The film is sweet, deep and soulful and tells in an imaginative and fantastic way all the events that Dickens had to face to write one of his greatest masterpieces. The film succeeds in the great task of never boring the viewer even if it has to tell a very slow and very articulated story and it succeeds a lot also thanks to the stratagem of introducing characters from the story into real life in a very natural and very well done way. So we can say that this film is a beautiful insight into the personal life of a tormented writer who, however, as in his story, manages to change and succeeds in what he had to do."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Amazing!,"Just watch it! Go ahead and watch it instead of looking at the rating! Its probably 6/10 cuz not many people would have watched it yet! You will not feel bored for even a second is what I can absolutely surely tell you! Such an amazing direction and the background music to top it off! I initially thought cuz it's a documentary will I feel bored but nah! The story telling from the original family members and with the recreated scenes all of them were really sad and creepy to watch!!!👌🏻👌🏻I love how before each person died or before explaining the way they died,it first shows the picture of the person about to die and shows the birth and death year marked in red first and then shows that the said person is gonna die which leaves us in a tensed situation! One thing to absolutely mention is the opening of this film🍿 They successfully captures the attention of the viewer from how well they did the opening! It would be a shame to stop this review without acknowledging the bgm!!That bgm is something man! When you watch the documentary and then the bgm plays it really puts you in a spot! This is my first time writing a review cuz i absolutely loved this piece! Kinda gave me dhrishyam flashbacks at certain points!"
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),How a documentary should not be made,"First of all I certainly don't know the truth. This is the first time I heard about the case. But thanks to this dumb documentary, i somehow feel pity for Jolly. This documentary establishes that Jolly killed 6 people by red boxing their birth and death years, when on ground almost four cases lack forensic evidence that they have died of cyanide and Jolly too pleads not guilty. 90% of narration happens from Jolly's sister in law perspective who absolutely hates Jolly and finds Jolly odd in every scenario you put her. Her narration is very narration-like. The reasons she gave mostly for Jolly's motives are very unconvincing. That cyanide search in her house is a publicity stunt, is that how evidence was gathered seriously by taking the accused to show where she hid it. Can't the police themselves find out cyanide from 20-30 boxes in the kitchen? Well you may ask what about.when Jolly admitted to her son.. there are lopsides here. Firstly her son seemed totally detached with her. Next he questioned her in a very aggressive and very biased tone when she is already strictly in panic. Third is that whatever he said that she admitted is what he said. There's scope for belief and disbelief. Finally, is admission a conclusive proof? I can go on but I wish the viewer to judge. This felt more like a documentary-trial."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Lopsided documentary with hidden agenda,"Movie clearly seems to be a hidden agenda by her in-laws to frame Jolly for murder. The story is narrated with a fixed point of view ans a lot of gaps that donr seem to be addresses. The fact that they find cyanide conveniently days after her being arrested seems very odd. Also, no clear agend a or motive for killing the young baby at a cousins party or the wife whose husband she just wished she had. If we go by wishes alone as proof the whole village might be convicted. Very gossipy and gripping tale telling but I feel I wasted time watching this documentary....
The story seems to have a judge jury executioner type narrative which is difficult to watch if a person has a logical mind.... Disturbing to see these things still happening in India..."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Poorly made,"Very much half baked documentary,many links are missing here, about shizu's involment for killing his wife and daughter,how did jolly make college card access to the college, her college library access for cyanide study is completely missing,her physical relationship with that cpim worker who made her fake I card and everything,that angle is completely missing, jolly's previous life as a thief was missing,Mathew's involvement as a whole is missing as he knew about the murders and helped jolly through out for that matter, that angle was not clear in the documentary. Roy's involvement in making fake will was not clear, this documentary is very poorly made."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Soulless monster,"It is vastly disturbing that not only was she getting the cyanide on the pretense of poisoning a poor stray dog (what type of monster harms an innocent animal?????!!!!!), but that she killed a 2-year-old child. We have seen documentaries on serial killers and similar before - this is nothing new. Her motives not only shone a light on the apathetic monster she was but the meticulous way she constructed the ""reality"" around her to work in her favor. My heart breaks when I hear news of animal and/or child abusers/killers. They are the most vulnerable in our society and we are not doing enough to protect either."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),A pre-sensory documentary with so-so plot of direction,"Personally i liked the content of documentary for its cosmopolitan mindset by director as he tried his best level for making viewer to sit on edge of seat, but as a viewer for such traumatic incident i always wants to check from culprits perspective. As here in CYANIDE AND CURRY we are constantly going through clips of victims perspective (i totally agree thats what happen in documentary) but some where i expect mindset of culprit. Now the point it went wrong is we expect no loopholes and suspense to be there till end but here it was least. So many scenes we believe its very much unquestioned, like working in NIT and no one asking about monthly look after of expense as they are sharing livelihood under 1 roof and her husband is doubtless. Police seem very naive as after jolly's father-in-law's demise, everything seems pointless. While Jolly's husband death no one thought of murder attempt or struggling to death as he fainted in bathroom but not in table where he had supper, where police just consider the whole statement for suicide from JOLLY these points are very pinching as it seems screenplay had took from any book So many things more
But for now these much rest in next Hoping for movie from JOLLY's perspective to be done for mass and better reach."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Bone-chilling doc,"Curry & Cyanide is an absolutely gripping and disturbing documentary about the Koodathayi Cyanide killing case and includes viewpoints from many individuals involved with the events. Kudos to the sister who pursued the case relentlessly to ""speak for the dead"" even under intense public scorn. The creators of the series meticulously compiled the data and and superbly articulated the gruesome story related to this case. This is a psychopath story that may make you lose faith in humanity at times and will definitely leave you feeling unwell in the end. Netflix does a good job releasing these true crime documentaries."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),She did not do it.,"It's plain to see this lady did not commit these crimes. The family has basically accused her of killing anyone who died of natural deaths in their family over the course of 20 years. It's ridiculous. The family obviously wants to cut her out of the will. The sister is driving this vendetta and it's difficult to watch. There is no evidence of a crime being done much less by Jolly. How anyone can believe this drivel is beyond me. She killed a remote cousins kid at a family party, in front of everyone because a friend of a friend said she wanted to marry the kids dad?! As I write this I can barely understand this much less imagine people actually believe this. Hard to watch how dumb it is."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),Gripping Documentary,"I remember hearing lots of news reports and self-made theories related to this case from media houses a few years back. I never knew all the details of this case, and we tend to forget all the elements, including the chronology of events, after a few years. This documentary does well in collating all the details and I did enjoy this doc from Netflix. I won't say this is a bad documentary but still, there were questions left unanswered and I think the creators could have included all this and could have made it a comprehensive one. I am not going into spoilers. Just give the documentary a watch and you will get it."
Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023),First Indian true crime documentary I've seen,"The crimes described in this documentary are horrible and despicable. I am very sorry for the sons who have lost so many loved ones, and, in a way, have also lost their mother. It was very interesting to watch for me because I've never seen a true crime documentary from India. As a European, I think you can learn quite a bit through this docu beyond the actual topic. For example, I didn't know there are so many Christians in Kerala and I found it interesting to learn about the dominant gender roles that kind of protected Jolly from suspicion for so long. That made this docu much more interesting than watching yet another true crime docu about an american or European case. Also: Great respect to the aunt who pushed for a police investigation. She seems to be a truly just person."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Interesting but,"This documentary was definitely an interesting one as I never heard about this camp before. However, I felt it really lacked content. I strongly believe if they actually collected more stories from more people we would get a rich documentary or maybe the story wasn't enough to make a filull documentary about. This documentary can be easily summarized in a youtube video instead. If more witnesses or participents were there we would get a clearer image of what was happening or understand the kids' opinions on how they felt. The ending was meh also as they didn't really explain what happened with him when it comes to law l."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Meh,"Bad parenting outsourced to bad people. The irony of how terrible Steve's family becomes is incredible. For someone selling services around discipline and self actualization, the fact his kids were doing heroin and ended in prison is just hilarious. The wife, who clearly has a loyalty card at the plastic surgeon office, apparently didn't police her kids any more than Steve himself, and they failed spectacularly as parents. Luckily, Steve died young. Even more ironic is that American pursuit of the magic pill to treat anything. You're a terrible parent and your kid is turning terrible? Send them to an expensive terrible camp about which you do zero due diligence, if you're lucky the kid will die and you'll get some insurance money. Worst case, he's off your hands for a while. Either way it's not your fault. And the last irony: it's a thriving industry to this day. Overall not a good documentary. A lot of screen time is given to Steve's family who is clearly up its own ass and doesn't bring much. It's also very one sided. Little work is done around following the money, or where Steve was and what he was doing most of the time. Feels like a gen z documentary. Half assed, outraged, and ultimately rather pointless."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Spends 50% of the doc defending a horrible man?,"I get showing the full perspective and including every voice, but maybe 3/4ths of the people interviewed in this documentary defend the camps and Steve Cartisano's actions instead of talking about what went on and interviewing more victims. It's honestly disheartening,- the ex-wife, daughter, and ex-camp counselor don't show much (or any) empathy. When they talk about how a teen died at the camp, the wife mentions how upset it made Steve and then starts complaining about the court-case, and the daughter complains about the news coverage while coming across as very arrogant. It felt like a lot of this was intended to diminish the degree of the abuse that went on and excuse or justify what Cartisano did. It did well when telling the stories of the survivors, but unfortunately falls short otherwise."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Reminiscing changed to outrage,"I did not attend this program, but another very similar called Aspen Achievement Academy in late 91 or 92. The first 20 minutes were reminiscent of my experience, the hiking, hand cart, tarps, and camp fires. I entered the program a very selfish, abusive, entitled, brat. My parents sent me to this program after trying everything, after I overdosed I was put on a plane headed for SLC. It was so hard! I hated it. It was exactly what I needed. I credit that program for saving my life. It gave me self esteem and survival skills. In my group there wasn't any abuse, the counselors were great. The food was terrible, salt pork, biscuits cooked on/in the ashes. My favorite ""treat"" was a lot of powdered milk in my water bottle, with less milk than required, left outside the tarps to freeze, a makeshift milkshake. I was there October to December, so it was cold at times. We talked a lot about what we would eat when we ""got out"". We took baths in the creeks, quickly because it was very cold. We moved almost every day, and were taught to not leave a sign we were there. I saw some of the most incredible sights, and met some wonderful people, all while finding myself. I believe these types of programs can be very great for some youth, for others it could definitely push them over the edge. This should be a last resort, not a ""my daughter won't clean her room"" punishment. The people leading should have education in child psychology, and lots of experience in survival skills. It absolutely saved me, I'm eternally grateful for it. It breaks my heart that people have experienced torture and abuse at the hands of people claiming to want to help. Having adult children of my own, now, I can't imagine feeling like this is your last chance, you're out of options, and you'd do anything to save your child. To make that decision and find out something terrible was done at the hands of people you entrusted your children to....not sure how you could get past that."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Not Shocking At All,"I was horrified by this documentary. When will society ever learn? In the 70's parents were admitting their ""problem children"" into Psychiatric hospitals. The children were there for various ages and reasons from extreme disorder to a simple truant. The only segregation was between boys and girls. Thorazine was over used as well as a variety of other medications in an attempt to control the children. Small 10x10 rooms titled ""the thinking room"" were used for isolation. Keep in mind in the early 70's husband's were still having their outspoken or independent wives admitted in to Psych. Units and lobotomized. Children's mental health is a billion dollar industry with insurance paying for it the institutionalization of children under the guise of Mental Health will continue."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Lacks substance and fails in drawing social conclusion,"One should not be disappointed after learning that the 'child well-being' cannot be obtained on the free market, but must know better in the first place. This documentary rides on a moderately engaging story with some rough and illegal outbursts by adults during the organized 'wilderness therapy'. However, as you are introduced in the story, you are expecting a lot more (check out the Netflix documentary Scouts Honor - its a far better one on the similar topic) but you get lots of the same stories told by different people. This would be relevant if they went with proving some patterns or structural issues within these types of therapies, but they failed to deliver any such conclusion worth of social impact. If the goal was to portray these horrible events than they should be covered with more focus and content. Moreover, you are left unsatisfied with some of the stories which ironically prove everything contrary of what the documovie was trying to prove in the first place - for example, parents commenting on the issue of organizers gaining money and them paying for this endeavors. In my opinion, this emphasizes the lack of substance of a 'modern american family' and shows one more time how misplaced people's focus could be. Not to mention that this was obscure notions as these types of organizations really requires significant funds, but it puts out of the place the very essence and rather systematic issue of capitalistic society (that hapiness and child well-being can be obtained on the free market and be left with shock when you learn the harder way that it cannot). On the other hand, I must confer that the underlying concerns portrayed in this docu are extremely important and that's the main advantage of this film."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Camps from Hell,"A deluded unpleasant person called Steve Cartisano who is basically a fraudster and criminal with no proper qualifications or training runs a Wilderness Camp for teens who need proper help. Instead of giving the children help and guidance his camps are awful places which generally abuses the children at the same time getting big fees from the parents who ought to know better. Cartisano's family and associates are interviewed, and they came across as deluded and devious as he is. Shocking how kids can be badly mistreated when it take so long for the authorities to try to take action,. We also learn that Cartisano also committed sexual abuse on at least one of the victims. He had his own children who were addicts etc. The producers ought to have been more sever on showing this was totally a criminal enterprise masquerading as doing good: 6/10."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Would've been better as a mini series,"This documentary is okay. But it seems like they're trying to fit so many things that happened into a ""small"" documentary. It would've been better if it were a mini series then they could've gone deeper into every aspect of the things that happened and possibly more things that happened. Even the ending is lacking in the fact that it needs something. The ending basically feels like a teaser for another documentary that is about these kinds of camps but not run by that Steve guy. Just make a docuseries that focuses on these types of camps but have the main camp be his camps. All in all it's a horrible thing to have happened to these kids (now adults) but the fact that these camps still exist baffle me."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),So Much,"At beginning of doc, I think ""this is a great idea! Kids need some discipline. They are unbearable to live with, using drugs, getting in trouble at school and with the law."" Let them have some consequences by being out in the wilderness. I felt for the parents. I have raised teenagers and at times, I really felt helpless and completely disrespected. A prisoner in my own home and treated like a criminal by my own children. But then, a poor girl dies...of course from the extreme weather conditions she endured in this camp. Not close to any medical help. And Steve Cartisano says he is not responsible. His wife says he is not responsible. How could he be? He wasn't there? At this point I'm screaming at the television. How obtuse? How stupid? How entitled? Somehow, with a high profile attorney, he beats the charges of negligence causing death. Instead of sailing off into the sunset, he opens another camp ""on the water."" He doesn't have permission to dock on the islands that he sails to, and again, he should not be held accountable because ""he is never there"". It starts to look like "" Lord of the Flies"". His wife is very sad because there is no more money coming in. His children are also sad because the authorities shut the camp down. But then this Steve Cartisano tries his hand one last time, opening a camp in Samoa, and sends his drug addicted son there. There are reports of sexual abuse. And physical abuse. A video tape is proof. The camp is shut down. The US embassy rescues the remaining kids. Steve Cartisano faces no charges. At the end of the movie, one of the kids in the Utah camp, I believe, accuses Steve Cartisano of fondling her breasts. She was only a teenager. Her mother does not pursue legal action against Cartisano, thinking it will stop him from helping kids. So sick. I couldn't help but think that karma came for Cartisano. He died very young of colon cancer, his son who was a drug addict is currently in jail, and his clueless daughter ( she couldn't understand why the authorities were coming after her dad....) also had a rough time on drugs. What goes around comes around."
Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare (2023),Only in the USA,"Only in the USA... Clueless parents try to raise clueless children in a clueless, uneducated society, leaving their children in the hands if clueless ex- military....
Instead of taking responsibility of their OWN failure, these simple, shallow ""parents"", not capable of parenting, turned to clueless, 35 years old Steve Cartisano and clueless Lance ""Horsehair"" Jaggar, two militairy men with no pedagogical education or experience. What could go wrong? 🙂
Reality is it went wrong at the moment these parents were allowed to have children. Perhaps it would have been a better idea to send these clueless parents on a re-educational trip, before exposing children who are in their most vulnerable, (self-)exploring, defiant time of their life, to be kidnapped by a bunch of idiots with no professional credentials in a program where children died. It became a multi million usd business and remarkable is to hear clueless (wife) Debbie Cartisano's excuse that ""a lot of money was coming in, but a lot of money was going out as well"", while living in a 6500 square feet, which was ""adequate"" for her. (sarcasm) Its always good to hear that people profiting from society, offering no real value, just misery, can live their lives in ""adequate"", 6500 sq. Feet properties without taking respobsibility for the death and misery of those they earn from. But the worst thing, besides that no-one has been held accountable for the deaths & injured, it became business as usual. Like it never happened."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),This move was fairly bad,This movie was loud and boring and any time I when to the movies I could hear this playing in the background of the movie and me and my girlfriend when to watch it and in my own opinion it was a really bad move. I know a lot of people like.this move but I am not one of those people this move was overly exaggerated for a move that wasn't even that good even my girlfriend who is a huge Taylor swift fan said that she hated the movie because she said that it was really bad and both me and her did not care for this movie I'm not trying to be negative but she needs to stop making movies because she is bad at it.
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),THE BEST CONCERT EVER!!!!!!,"If you're going to watch the Eras Tour movie, I would recommend catching it in theaters while you can. This movie is so good and so much fun, I don't have any words. Including me, there were four people in my theater, so it wasn't as crazy but it was still super fun. The reputation section is my favorite part of the movie, partly because it was super cool, mostly because it's my favorite album. I got a bit bored in the folklore, evermore, and Midnights sections because those aren't my most favorites and I also didn't have much of those three memorized, but in the other sections, I was having a lot of fun, and that's my review."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT DOCUMENTARIES,"I never thought filming the amazing Taylor Swift live in concert would be this delightful. The overwhelming atmosphere and excitement in the stadium are undeniably felt throughout the documentary. The cinematography and editing in each of the Taylor Swift eras featured are top tier. The clips were beautifully edited and made the audience feel the exact vibe from each song. Basically, there were no ugly shots in the film. I just had a minute issue with the sound editing. At times the sounds were sloppy. But nevertheless it perfectly captured what it was like to witness the most attended tour of the year."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),Concert movie perfection!,"I'm so glad you created this tour and film for all of us! Everything is so real, so you, and so entertaining. Your lyrics are beyond. Your costumes to die for. Just overall I felt privileged to bevon the journey of your life this far. We all can only imagine your next chapters. Lucky us. Please take care of yourself and please prioritize self care first and foremost. We'll always be here for you! Our hope is you've found the love of your life because you deserve to be loved for exactly who you are! We all do and can learn from your happiness. All our best to you, your mom, your dad, your brother!"
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),Long live...Miss Americana,"Taylor Swift is probably the best artist in the world and I can't see her being beaten anytime soon. I do believe that I have just watched the greatest show ever made. It's fine if you are not a fan of pop music, or blondes, or women, or indeed just her. But no-one can deny that her shows are superlative. The Eras final US stage show opens with an aerial view of the 100,000 seat SoFi stadium in Los Angeles, and the camera dips to enter the stadium and show a packed out venue, with a stage almost half the length of the stadium field. The entire stage is also made up of hundreds of screens. Throughout this several minute long sequence Taylor can be heard voicing titles and song lyrics and statements, all designed to build up to the start of the show. Every person has a ticket on a lanyard which can light up and they are all controlled by the musical director. They also have armbands which light up too, and flash with the music. About 80,000 of these lights make the stadium look like a clear, starry night. Enormous, 5 metre tall butterfly wings enter the stage in front of the enormous screen, flowing gracefully all the way to the far end where they seem to gently float down to a pile on the stage floor. Ethereal music with hints of Swift tracks plays as these gossamer wings finally settle to the floor, then rise quickly to reveal Taylor, in a trademark sparkly outfit, who moves immediately into the song Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince. The crowd of course erupt with cheers as she appears and thus starts 3 solid hours of spectacular showmanship the like of which I've never, ever seen. She sucks the audience in during a 17 minute introduction to the tour show, with some fabulous tracks and beautiful imagery and non stop energy before she even says hello. By the time she properly greets them, they are all one and tuned into her and the entire stadium including security and venue staff are all in one organic pleasure orgy based around Swift's personality and music. As a way of introducing one of the songs Taylor shows that she can control 70,000 simply by pointing a finger, and long time fans like me know after a few moments what she is referencing. It's her way of leading into a particularly track. The scenes and sets backed up by hundreds of enormous screens, lights and special effects are beautifully done and are worthy of the best sets Hollywood has to offer. The entire concert is worth watching just for the scenes created, and the costumes that they all wear which suit the songs and the scenes. The production value is out of this world. If you watch her backing singers, dancers and other staff during the film, you see a dedicated bunch of guys, highly experienced and rehearsed, all ensuring that their part in the night also goes smoothly. Taylor's superpower, apart from being a beautiful human being that is so approachable, is in creating images in your head with lyrics. She has done if for years for me and sometimes I wish I could see a film based on some of the scenes she makes me imagine while listening to her music. Taking the freedom to produce her own show, she makes a lot of those images come to life for us, bigger and better perhaps than we could have thought of. Your mind is allowed to run amok as she almost seems to free you of earthly ties simply by singing and showing you her colourful, energetic, surreal world. All the familiar tracks are there, and Taylor moves effortlessly from pop, to rock, to folk, to hiphop, to country and back to rock with such ease that you think there are no genres anymore. Taylor Swift has made all genres merge into 1 giant super-music genre labelled Swiftish. She interacts personally with her fans, she interacts regularly with her backup singers and dancers and musicians. She has no God complex, she has humility and knows that she is part of an unstoppable musical machine, but one which relies on others to help it along. And she humbly thanks us, the fans, for letting her do this. Letting her reach our very hearts and souls with love and anger and joy and sadness and thoughtfulness, in a unique and beautiful way. She makes sure every person attending can see her and hear her, and although she is dancing as well as singing for a solid 4 hours, she barely misses a beat, constantly smiles at her audience, and puts everything she has into singing the songs -not just repeating lyrics musically like a lot of artists do- but actually singing them and putting the appropriate feeling into the lyrics so that her singing matches the meaning of the words. Another thing that not many artists do. Taylor covers songs from each of her albums, hence the name 'Eras tour' so any fan at any point of fandom can enjoy something. She absolutely slayed All Too Well, one of her best songs along with 'Long Live'. And yet even her very early songs all seem just as relevant as her latest ones. Such is the power of her storytelling. Barely breaking sweat she travels the length of the stage many times and even at one point shocks the crowd by seemingly diving off stage into a 100 metre long pool and swimming to the far end so she can leave the set to get changed. The 4 hours of all of her past hits from the present to her first song passes by far, far too quickly: I could happily have sat for another 4 hours listening to and watching this amazing force of nature. Throughout the entire show she commands the stage, and controls the audience, leading them willingly into pleasure and joy in her own inimitable way. She proved that simply by pointing a finger she can control thousands of people at a time, and they love her doing it because she is one of them. Indeed the big studios turned their noses up at her idea of having a filmed grand tour. I bet they're regretting it now that she followed her instincts for what her fans want and did it anyway, for them. Taylor Swift, despite her flaws and wholesome humility, has become a living legend, easily witnessed by her rise to super stardom and the unwavering passion of her fans: men and women, old and young. And I believe that she has changed not just music, and not just showmanship forever, but also taught us what it's like to be a great human. I give this show my first ever 10, and I'd give it more if I could."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),From the opinion of a swiftie...,"Seeing this in theatres was so so so fun. Everybody that you saw there was so genuinely happy, dressed up and trading friendship bracelets. Our theatre let us treat it like a real concert and we got to sing and dance. The Taylor Swift eras tour movie is such an amazing experience. It was so much fun and going to see it in theatres will be one of my favourite experiences until I see the actual real life tour in person next year. Everyone there was so nice and I love that because its bringing people of all ages together. There were elderly women and men and also toddlers. This was such a great movie and experience and I highly recommend going."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),You've got to be kidding,"She is a very cute girl. In fact her looks are way more notable than her singing talent. To be honest I don't know how she is as a song writer because I'm totally ignoring the lyrics. My bad. However I'm fairly confident there is nothing earth shattering that she has to say. The actual songs are very dime a dozen boring, mundane, nothing memorable. One sounds basically the same as the next. Considering this is probably the biggest money making tour in history, it's remarkable it takes so little to be a rich & famous performer. Most of the songs are just speaking words while making some droning sounds that give the allusion of singing. She doesn't have a good voice really. The production value of the stage performance is pretty good. Lots of dazzle dazzle. I prefer just turning off the volume and looking at her long legs and pretty face but certainly not for 3 hours."

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),Look what you made me do.,"It's disheartening when shared interests don't align. Yearning for go-karting camaraderie with your sister-in-laws, the absence of this shared joy might echo a deeper sense of isolation. The disappointment is compounded by the fact that the envisioned experience is in a pilgrim style, suggesting a desire for a communal, nostalgic journey. This longing for connection through a playful activity unveils the importance of bonding over shared experiences, making the unfulfilled aspiration of go-karting with your sister-in-laws a poignant reminder of the gap in your shared adventures. A discouraged brother in law."
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023),Just a means for a billionaire to make more money,"Let's face it, the movie is targeting Swifties who likely already paid for tickets to her shows. It's just a means of milking her fans, making the most of her popularity. I really hated it when I heard someone say 'she needs our support'. No, she really doesn't. Just about every other artist in the world does though! From what I saw and already know, her songs are all negative. It's actually not good enjoying music with negative themes or connotations, as it invokes negativity in the listener. Psychology of music and other media (TikTok etc) should be taught, as it's a huge influence on society in a bad way. I didn't intend to rant, I'm just annoyed that there was literally nothing to this 'movie'. Cost practically nothing to make, it's purely about making money. The person who dragged me into watching it was a fan a year ago, but is now continually put off by the money making of the old album re-releases and sheer profit grabbing of this practically free to make film. Please people, support other artists who make great songs and put in the effort."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Good doc,"Very good documentary about the case, seems to offer different angles and features the actual interviews that you can find on YouTube. Informative and interesting."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),"Great documentary, master manipulators mother and daughter","Having watched the act and this documentary it gives you more insight to how far abuse can go, was Dee Dee a manipulator yes but as you watch you see the daughter is not as innocent as she looks, she had plenty time to get away she was walking all the time, shoplifting like her mother and the tears don't get me started but going through what she did with her mother scamming people she did too and also liked the attention as for the tears well they came out as an when she needed to cry to try and convince people she a innocent little girl no you were in your twenties found out yrs earlier you could walk, even went on to scam people after the fact then went on to manipulate a online vunerable person to commit murder beyond belief he got life and she didn't, yes her mum deserved everything she got but so does she master manipulators like mother like daughter learnt from the best nice one for getting someone life an ditching him tears don't work with me I'm from similar background but I know what's right and wrong"
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),One of the Most Disturbing Stories I've Ever Heard,"I don't know where to begin. I am one hour into this documentary, and about twenty-two minutes are left. I am completely horrified by everything I've seen sovfar. I have never heard of this crime, the people involved, anything. This tale, which is not simply a crime story, is probably the most horrifying incident I've ever heard in my life, and it's not the murder itself that is the most disturbing, but rather, ALL that led up to it. All that Gypsey Rose endured her entire life up until her mother's murder. And, she'll probably need a lifetime of expensive therapy which she'll never be able to afford. The lofetime of hprror that that mother inflicted upon her daughter gave me the chills, and I was completely uncomfortable, unsettled, disgusted, revolted and horrified by what that woman did to her daughter, and equally as much by how the system COMPLETELY failed her. She endured purposeful, systematic, abuse by her mother, and the system FAILED her completely her entire life. Her life heretofore has been a complete freak show.
I hope she will be able to start a new life. Somehow."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Good documentary,"But it kind of left the feeling that there are a lot of things left behind... like Gypsy has a fiancé.
And on the other hand, regardless the whole thing, i think the father has some guilty in this, i mean, he wanted to let everything in the past for his own good.. he had unprotected sex, he married because of a rule made by swamp people that can hardly talk understandable english, and then a year later he left. He left his daughter.. and then, spoiler alert, by the end of the docu, Gypsy said to him and his wife, that he had no guilt in this, which is sad, because she has nobody except for her awful parent, and of course, he said, yes. ha!"
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),A Truly Unique and Mindblowing Documentary,"This story is incredibly fascinating, in the deepest, darkest and saddest of ways. Even if you know the facts and outcome of this case from the media, it is still remarkable to listen to the horrifying accounts of the events from all those involved. Excellent documentary from HBO."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Such A Sad And Screwed Up Case,"This case is so screwed up but it is so interesting. Dee Dee claimed that Gypsy had cancer even though she never did. But she was also very abusive to Gypsy and it got bad to the point that she bribed her boyfriend from Wisconsin that she met online to kill Dee Dee. And while I don't condone murder I understand why she wanted her dead. The sad thing is, I dont just feel bad for Gypsy but in some way I feel bad for Nick (her boyfriend) who has autism. He has been in prison before then though. He got arrested at a McDonalds, but he was very immature despite being autistic. He also got life in prison, which i thought was too harsh because the mother was absolutely horrible to Gypsy and made her sick all for attention and sympathy and money for trips, but she also was controlling and abused her terribly. So I really think Nick needs maybe 15 or 20 years for murdering Dee Dee and not life. I will say, I am glad he was brutally honest when he admitted that he stabbed Dee Dee. Which as an autistic person myself, it is a big habit autistic people has, and I am talking about being brutally honest almost all the time. I will say, this documentary was so good and this case is so sad but so interesting. 9 out of 10."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Must-see documentary: you can't make this stuff up!,"""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" (2017 release; 82 min.) brings the story of Gypsy and her mom DeeDee. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Waukesha, June 15, 2015"", and Gypsy is being interviewed by a police officer about her possible involvement in DeeDee's brutal murder. Gypsy denies any involvement. We then go to ""Six Years Earlier"" as we see Gypsy and DeeDee onstage somewhere, with Gypsy singing a song while in a wheelchair, to wild acclaim from the audience. Gypsy looks strangely different. The documentary then goes to ""Springfield, MO"" where Gypsy and DeeDee eventually had settled... At this point we're 10 min. into the documentary. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this documentary is from director-producer Erin Lee Carr, and in just a matter of a few years, she has been making a name for herself as one of the leading documentarians in this country. (In 2019, she released the top-notch ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"" as well as the riveting ""I Love You, Now Die""). In ""Mommy Dead And Dearest"", Carr looks at a case of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy (where a caretaker--usually a mother, makes up health problems of another person--usually a child) that is so wild and so unthinkable that if this weren't a real life case, you simply wouldn't believe it. Gypsy's list of alleged illnesses (including being paralyzed from the waist down) is longer than a grocery list when your kitchen needs restocked. What I kept thinking was: how did these hospitals not see through this? ""Everyone failed (Gypsy), literally everyone,"" comments someone. Please note that the director was able to snag a long one-on-one interview with Gypsy, just watch... And I admit that at the end of the documentary I welled up. Here's hoping that Gypsy eventually will get an opportunity to ""live a normal life"". This film originally came out on HBO two yeas ago, and I recently saw it on HBO On Demand. So glad I sis. If you love a investigative documentaries, do yourself a favor, and check out ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"", and any other work from director Erin Lee Carr. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Chilling,"Even if you know the outcome of this case, this documentary will shock you. It's very well done and a must watch for any true crime lovers."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),"Premature and manipulative, but not bad","""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well-edited and put together film. It tells the narrative behind the Gypsy Rose Blamchard case in a coherent way, and it introduces the viewers to most pertinent characters to try to get a complex overview of this bizarre case. The directors succeed in trying to present the case in an objective way, talking to family members, police officers, lawyers, doctors and psychologists alike, but nonetheless there is still a problematic bias in this documentary as well an odd and conflicting ambivalence, as if the filmmakers both oversimplified and overcomplicated their narrative at different turns. These insidious manipulations aggravate an otherwise technically proficient documentary, which is nonetheless likely to be one of the better ones out there. Despite the notion of a happy ending ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives, I have a feeling there is more to complicate the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Viewers note that while Gypsy Rose Blanchard has been given ten years prison time, the man she asked to murder her mother Dee Dee for her, Nicholas Godejohn, has been given a lifetime sentence and Gypsy is effectively done with him. Psychologists interviewed within the film have given Gypsy the doubt of bein a sociopath, and while I appreciate how the filmmakers didn't shy away from that I question whether they haven't manipulated events (the family reunion with Gypsy's father) in too much favor for her. If they haven't, then just be aware that the something here is still pretty messed up, and the answer ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" gives is far too pat. Even still, ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" is a well told, but probably premature documentary, and I don't believe it's the full story it is made out to be. Some kudos to the filmmakers for making some notion of possible discrepancies, apthough not going far enough in exploring them so as to feel fully fledged or complete. Mixed feelings about this one."
Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017),Such a heartbreaking story,Gypsy's story is so sad and it's so heartbreaking to see what happened to her. I feel for her so much. I understand why she did what she did. The documentary is really good in showing you her point of view and what she went through.
American Symphony (2023),peek inside the curtains,"Musician Jon Batiste is composing a symphony while his wife/writer Suleika Jaouad undergoes cancer treatment. This is a documentary. I know Jon Batiste only through ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"". My surface take on him is radical positivity. It's more than being Ed McMahon. He seems like a guy who reacts with a smile no matter what the situation. This movie lets the audience a peek inside the curtains. There are moments. There are big moments of anxiety and doubt and depression. It may be small little peeks, but they are enough to paint a picture of the man and his relationship with his wife. Those extra paint colors really sets off the climatic musical performance."
American Symphony (2023),Wondrous journey into two souls,"2022 was the best of times, the worst of times for Jon Batiste and Suleika Janouad. Both. Everywhere. All at once. In every moment. It was the year the couple married. It was the year Jon left his high-profile gig leading the band on The Late Show with Steven Colbert. He would go on to win five Grammys, including the coveted Album of the Year, which hadn't been won by a Black artist in more than a decade. Although Suleika's bestselling ""Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life Interrupted"" would be acclaimed as one of the best books of the 2022, she would spend most of the year in hospital beds, receiving chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and other treatments for the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia, a rare condition that had first stricken her a decade earlier. On September 22 of that year, Jon Batiste premiered his ""American Symphony"" in Carnegie Hall. His wife was in the audience. These events provide the framework for Matthew Heineman's powerfully affecting documentary that shares the title of Batiste's musical creation. Its Higher Ground production company was created by Michelle Obama and her husband in 2018 with the goal of lifting diverse voices in the entertainment industry. It's playing on Netflix. It feels meant to be, writing about ""American Symphony"" after recent blogs reviewing ""Maestro"" and ""American Fiction."" They have a lot in common. Like ""Maestro,"" it presents a loving marriage of creative giants, the husband fulfilling his artistic genius, the wife beset by setbacks and pain beyond belief. Like ""American Fiction,"" it focuses on a brilliant Black artist staking his creative claim in a society built on a foundation of the enslavement of his race. (The similarity of the films' titles is unfortunate, confusing and diluting each's powerful impact during this awards season.)
Except, unlike the other two films, ""American Symphony"" doesn't have actors. It has the actual people. They're not acting, they're living their lives. Filmmaker Heineman is the third member of their marriage, capturing an intimacy that rarely makes its way to the screen. He's there with them in their bedroom or her hospital bed, as they grapple with everything coming their way. In one light-hearted interlude, Suleika takes Jon to the snow. He has never sledded before. We ride down the hill with them, lost for a moment in giddy, silly escape. But not for long. Pain, isolation and discomfort are givens in Suleika's illness. What's not expected is the resilience, philosophical strength and occasional bursts of humor she finds to face them. In her bed she starts painting giraffes. They quite good, actually. By her side supporting her, Jon is also up against a different set of challenges. Scion of a New Orleans musical dynasty, his gifts transported him to Juilliard en route to a rarified place in the musical hierarchy where fame itself may become his greatest danger. Heineman - and his three co-cinematographers - transport us into his brain, recording telephone sessions with Jon's therapist flowing into voice-over commentary that unflinchingly probes his artistic process, and the insecurities besetting artists no matter how much acclaim they achieve. The documentary was filmed in the time of Covid, but finds endless expressiveness in its characters' eyes. When they remove their masks, their faces are visually striking element in the film's grand design. Jon's smile is sunshine; his dance moves are joy itself. The creation of Batiste's symphony provides a plot of sorts, as he mines deep ore in all the cultures that have produced ""America,"" beginning with the Indigenous people who were here when the Whites arrived, bringing the Blacks in chains a short time later. He melds their sounds into a musical masterwork that defies labels - classical, jazz, roots, blues, bebop, hip-hop and a hundred others - because it's them all. But the film's real symphony isn't just the music. It's the two people/ at the center of the story, bravely leading us on this wondrous journey into their souls."
American Symphony (2023),Not at all what I expected but exactly what I needed!,"What was I expecting? The typical rock star vibe, I guess. Absolutely wrong! Not even close. This is an amazing film about a person who is more than we suppose him to be. John Baptiste is an amazing human, amazing musician, so much feeling expressed through thoughts, actions, movement, embracing everyone, leading everyone. Feeling expressed as action, music, words, thoughts. It is a heavy burden to carry. This film portrays all of this so well that you feel what is happening. You do not just watch it. And it is not all happy but it is moving towards a better outcome. Now, I want to know more about this interesting person through his music, through his good works, through his writing. Our world is made better, larger with him in it, I feel somehow. I need to experience his music to understand more. And this film, this documentary, is an exceptional way to experience the mystery that is John Baptiste."
American Symphony (2023),Felt all the feelings,"Jon Batiste was first imprinted in my mind during Covid when The Stephen Colbert Show closed for the night. The undeniable positive, creative energy. A beautiful human who heals souls. I am not a religious person but now and again you come across humans who are just that. Clearly the documentary shows you the other side and the very real struggle to not only helplessly stand by while your partner suffers but everything else. Eternal hope and realism and pure love. This was my first introduction to Suleika. What a force and gorgeous artist. She makes me want to pick up my paint brushes again. They are making quite an imprint in this world. Individually and ultimately together. Thank you for making this movie. Kleenex thanks you too."
American Symphony (2023),Just beautiful! Inspiring prose..and pure joy!,"In everything is joy. What is unique about you? Whatever that is take it and excel with it. In the sadness there is joy to be found. You can not watch this without seeing John Babtist and his partner as pure joy. For in even the darkest times there is joy. That's the theme here and it's beautiful. As a documentary I'd say it's more of a piece of art than a documentary. Touching at every turn. The good the bad , the really bad and the well deserved super good! Watch the first 10 minutes and you'll know if it's for you. I'm betting it is. I'm betting on you. By the end you'll be feeling the increased desire to be the best you can be, find your love, be a blessing to others and find the joy. Bravo!!!"
American Symphony (2023),Love is art,"This Documentary is a poignant tale about life, love and art. It is a must see inspirational testament to overcoming insurmountable obstacles and turning poison into potion. Watching the story arch build you get an intimate peak inside what makes Jon Baptiste, the person behind the music, and his highly collaborative creative process. As well as Jon Batiste the family man. The story itself is the embodiment of an American symphony, encompassing all the genres and styles that form what we know to be an important part of American pop culture. If you've ever faced adversity while honing your craft then you will be able to see yourself through the subject of this compelling story."
American Symphony (2023),So moving,"American Symphony is an incredibly personal documentary that strikes a very strong balance between its portrayal of the artistic process and a beautiful relationship. It may be conventional but when it's so well crafted and its story is so emotionally resonant it's near impossible not to be moved or affected by any of this. Jon Batiste is very open here, showing so much in what feels like a very real look at his life and struggles. A magnetic presence when on the stage yet so humbling and relatable in everyday life. It's so interesting to watch his ideas forming in real time whilst his relationship with Suleika Jaouad gives the film its strongest moments. Matthew Heineman's direction manages to be very cinematic in its construction whilst still being able to maintain a consistent sense of intimacy. The structure of the film is really good too, building to the titular symphony in classic biopic fashion which gives it so much weight. Batiste's music and closing song really compliments everything and further foregrounds his undeniable talent."
American Symphony (2023),Incredibly moving,"Suleika and Jon are each incredible, multi-talented artists and we see that in this film. But beyond their talents, we see the incredible people they are and the incredible love that they share with each other and with the world all while going through tough challenges with her health. I cried throughout this movie. It's been a while since a show... and these two beautiful people...moved me like this. Thank you for sharing this, for being who you are, and for showing us what's possible when you open your heart and allow yourself to be vulnerable. I will watch this again and I urge others to watch it."
American Symphony (2023),A Beautifully Touching Film,"Creating a great work of art is very much like creating a heartfelt, loving relationship. Both take work and commitment, both in good times and bad. The challenges can be difficult, but the rewards can be incalculable. Learning how to successfully maneuver through them, as well as how to strike a harmonious balance that keeps both ventures moving forward, is a skill that takes an array of abilities and aptitudes s to master, but, as documentary filmmaker Matthew Heinenman's latest so deftly illustrates, it's an attainable goal, the prevailing highs and lows notwithstanding. The film follows the extraordinary year experienced by musician/composer Jon Batiste and his wife, best-selling author Suleika Jaouad. In 2022, they came face to face with both ends of the spectrum of life. Batiste, an artist with an impressive musical range and repertoire, was reaching new heights in his career, winning five Grammy Awards while serving as band leader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and seeking to complete work on an ambitious composition aimed at reflecting the breadth of our national music, diversity and culture, American Symphony. At the same time, though, Jaouad suffered a recurrence of the cancer she battled a decade earlier, an illness she chronicled in writings that would come to launch a career; now, after a 10-year remission, she was facing a second, potentially risky bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, not to mention an uncertain future. With such seemingly polar opposite fates befalling them, Batiste and Jaouad struggled to get through their respective challenges while keeping their love and art alive, putting their successes into perspective in light of what they were up against otherwise. This intimate, heartstring-tugging documentary gives viewers a candid, up-close look at what a truly loving couple can experience under such diverse, trying and bittersweet circumstances, but without becoming manipulative or melodramatic. This beautifully photographed story provides an unfiltered depiction of the range of emotions that each partner goes through, particularly when it comes to its depictions of the philosophical insights observed by each of the spouses. It also showcases Batiste's wide-ranging musical styles, both in his performances and in his composition process. Admittedly, a few of this offering's sequences meander a bit, but the overall production is skillfully edited and sensitively portrayed. ""American Symphony"" is a beautifully moving film, one that reinforces what matters most in life and what makes it worth living, during both good times and bad, as long as we have each other to make our way through it, bringing new meaning to what our marriage vows are ultimately all about."
American Symphony (2023),American Symphony Scores !!,Not the movie everyone expected but the movie eveyone needs - a beatifully done film that is powerful and engaging - the movie that delivers hope and promise for all of us - Jon Batiste and his wife Suleika have their lifes journeys before them - Unexpected twists and turns force both of them to reflect of their goals - their lives - their relationship - when Suleikas cancer returns - how they both deal with all of lifes responsibilities - while facing an unforseen crisis that turns their worlds upside down - a movie piece of filmmaking created with much love - a testament to the power of hope - of lasting dreams - and how to create a loving relationship that weathers all that lifes complexities have to offer - better or worse - wonderfully done - a must-see -
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (2023),Women cleansing themselves of their past traumas through communion in a sauna,"This is a very intimate exploration of the female psyche, but at the same time it's barely a film. Naked women in South Estonia spend time in a sauna sharing their secrets and pains and thus ritualistically cleansing themselves of them. An interesting concept, I would say especially for young people who have not been exposed to these kind of stories or had never had the opportunity to feel understood by peers and might learn something. There is some beautiful scenery and traditional and mystical rituals that are filmed very nicely, too. However nothing else much happens. If you are in the mood to hear these intimate stories of childhood trauma, love, teen love, abortions, rape, violence, mother daughter relationship, lesbianism, body image issues and so on, this is a great film for you. Yet at the same time it can be considered a loose collection of short female confessions that can be read separately, like a series of blog posts. My wife absolutely loved it. I felt it was not for me, although I appreciated it the format. The sauna in East Estonia and Finland and those areas is not merely a thing you do for pleasure, but has deep roots in their old culture, even pre-Christian and may have roots in rituals in the Neolithic. The film touches on that through scenes that show what is being done, but without any explanation. Read about it, it's fascinating. Bottom line: it's a film for women."
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (2023),"Not exceptional, boring and tiring","I found a movie a bit boring, yes it is touching human drama and stories told in the movie are touching but I think that emotions presented on the screen and via sound are not really making you feel them. At some point of the movie I wanted to leave the cinema because I just couldn't see the value in this film. There are few women in this movie and they all have some strange story and also they go to the same sauna - a bit strange and unlikely! Stories told by them are also a bit ""shallow"" and are being told in very boring way. If this was an audiobook I would say it is good but I feel personally that going to this movie was a waste of time. I also didn't see the connection between stories being said and sauna. Do people go to sauna to talk? From visual perspective movie was also not great, there were few shots in the sauna where apparently it was ""hot"" as people were sweating but you couldn't see it on the picture. I wrote this review after I saw the movie and I felt that I had to say what I feel after watching it. 3/10 sounds a bit low but at the moment I have to say something I don't say often - that I wouldn't watch it again under any circumstances."
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (2023),Honest and moving,"The very best documentaries open your eyes to a world that you never knew existed. They take you into the heart of that place where you're more than an observer but less than a participant. ""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" achieves that feat on a number of levels. For a start I know nothing about Estonia and even less about its tradition of enjoying rustic sauna huts in the wild birch forest. The process of using these shacks has a very meditational quality about it in the lighting of the fire and the gathering of the water. These simple but foundational acts feel so very appreciated here. At the same time this particular sauna is women only and you see them naked and sweating, safe in this environment and comfortable in their own skins. As a man it's quite something to witness these women being so physically and emotionally vulnerable with each other. They're free to share their deepest fears and concerns in this nurturing space and it's wonderful. The film also looks incredible with shooting clearly taking place in a range of seasons. The little light that makes it into the sauna refracts through shifting veils of smoke and reflects from limbs glowing in the firelight. You can almost smell the wood-smoke. Is it for everyone? Perhaps not but if you have an open mind and a desire to glimpse the lives of others then bag yourself a ticket."
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (2023),Gorgeously captured,"If they had used the Sauna Radar portal, such problems would not have happened. I'm kidding=)
But seriously, ""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" feels like a work of reflective art, weaving stories of relatable pains and joys as women, allowing all involved to heal and cleanse together. As a viewer, it's comforting to see the different layers of healing found universally. A tidal wave of emotion that builds and builds into a crashing catharsis. While most documentaries thrive on the strength of their story, Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is powerful simply because it accords a group of women the space to tell theirs."
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood (2023),"Strange, Bizarre, and Memorizing","Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival ""Smoke Sauna Sisterhood"" is a documentary about the darkness of a smoke sauna, women share their innermost secrets and intimate experiences, washing off the shame trapped in their bodies and regaining their strength through a sense of communion. This documentary is pretty strange and weird, but I really like this film. Throughout, the visual presentation and sound designs helps to capture the essence of a sauna, tone, and environment of Estonia. The words expressed from the participants are interesting as they helped to provide quite memorizing discussions about womanhood and their bodies. Each direction felt like the film was taking a half documentary and half narrative type style with beautiful soundtrack and writing throughout. The idea of people going in saunas to have spiritual experiences is quite fascinating. This won the Directing, Screenwriting and Editing award for the World Dramatic Documentary Competition and I can see why. The writing, directing and style of editing is really good and the award was well-deserved. Rating: A-"
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),See it on the biggest screen you can find.,"It is hard to imagine an artist or a concert more built for the big screen than this one. And since Beyoncé writes, directs, and produces herself, you get something more than just a standard concert film. You not only get a view of the concert itself that wouldn't be possible in real life (really all the concerts on her entire tour because of the fantastic editing work), but you see just how much sweat, determination, and perseverance go into a performance like this. Part of me was mindful of just how carefully Beyoncé has been curating her public persona for two decades, including this film, and part of me felt like I was seeing something new...or maybe I just didn't care because I had so much fun. I'm glad I saw it on the biggest and loudest screen possible, and I highly recommend you do the same."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),A Beyonce Fan's Dream,"What an absolute treat for Beyonce fans! It was so much fun to re-live her concert and learn more about how the tour is put together and run behind the scenes. It is nice to see her being a mom and a business woman. Learning her history and the reasons behind Renaissance made everything even more meaningful. This was shot over the span of the entire tour. It was so much fun seeing all of her costume changes and alternate sets/songs. Obviously, if you are not a Beyonce fan there is no point in watching or even hate-rating this. I will be watching this a few more times. Honestly, I think I may have enjoyed this even more than the actual concert."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),I'm way late to the party!,"Of course, I've always heard Beyoncé's music. We're of similar ages. Admittedly, her hits in the era of Single Ladies were not my cup of tea. After watching the trailer for this latest concert film of hers, I was gagged. The music had such a house vibe, which had me hooked 'cause I was a club kid. And after listening to snippets of her past albums since seeing this movie, what a dummy I was for missing out on her catalog. Now I know all the easter eggs. All the fans...it all makes sense. Uncle Johnny made my dress...dive in and you'll never wanna come up. I'm a mom, so the family dynamics behind the scenes were touching to me. Honestly, i'm very sensitive, so the trailer made me tear up. I know, i'm sappy. It's hard to fathom how she balances the immensity of this tour with her personal life. I have been to countless concerts in my life, various genres. Never have I seen a production like this. Every song was a completely different set. I really hope that she tours again so I can be one of the first to buy a ticket. I left this movie in awe, and feeling like I need to do more with my life. I will have a new respect for production when going to concerts; although none will compare to this one. If you're not a fan of house music, female power, equality, LGBTQ, this may not be the movie for you."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),There's a reason why she's a Queen B,"Beyonce really is larger than life even if the film wants to portray her as no longer striving for perfection in the intimate scenes. She is an entertainer in her peak and this is definetely her best concert yet. The film isn't just a concert highlight like Taylor Swift's Era but the concert is interwoven with intimate behind the scenes and interviews with Beyonce's close circle. The film is surprisingly very emotional as well, I found myself in tears on multiple occasions. Overall, it was such a joyful experience that I can only wish I was able to see live. 10/10 recommend seeing on a big screen."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),1 of 1. Number 1. The only 1.,"LOVED IT! This film made me relive the amazing show I had the privilege to witness in real life! I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes footage too, it feels great seeing Beyoncé putting it all together, as the superior artist she is, while praising all the crew that worked so hard for this tour. They truly created a supermachine. It never stops to amaze me how she always comes up with new stuff and manages to top everything she has done before. ''RENAISSANCE: A Film by Beyoncé'' is definitely the best gift she could give to us, her Beyhive, as this amazing year comes to an end! 1 of 1. Number 1. The only 1. Thank you, Beyoncé!"

Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),SIMPLY THE BEST,"I CANT SPEAK FOR ANYONE ELSE BUT SHE IS SUCH A QUEEN AND WARRIOR. A DEVOTED MOM AND WIFE AS WELL AS THE STANDARD FOR HIGH INTENSITY PERFORMANCES. SHE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE YOUNGEST LIVING LEGEND IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. SHE IS EVERYTHING AND IF YOU DON'T SAY OTHER WISE YOU'RE TRULY A HATER BABY. SHE HAS NOTHING TO PROVE TO ANYONE BECAUSE SHE'S THE PACKAGE. THIS WAS MOST MONUMENTAL EXPERIENCE OF 2023 WHERE THE COMMUNITY FELT HEARD AND LIBERATED THROUGH SOMEONE WITH SUCH A HUGE VOICE AND PLATFORM. THEE BEYONCÉ, FABULOUS, FEARLESS, GROUNDBREAKING AND TALENTED. HOW CAN WE NOT APPRECIATE THIS WOMAN THANK YOU!!"
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),I ugly cried for nearly 3 hours,"So many moments made me teary-eyed starting from 5 minutes in. There are so many joyful, sexy, reflective, and celebratory moments coupled with an entire world of lights, colors, fashion, diamonds, bass, and beauty. I felt like a total boss, a diva, a visionary, and a nurturer all in one. The entire movie audience was interactive throughout, which made us feel like we were at the concert. People around me sang, danced, cheered, and even swayed their fans. It was definitely a memorable moment! Do yourself a favor and watch if you are a fan of Beyonce or even just a fan of great music. By the time I left, I felt even more inspired to follow my passion."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),True Definition of ARTISTRY,"Beyoncé gives us yet another look into her life and expands into what it truly means to be an ARTIST. Renaissance gives us a deeper look into the adjacent album and show's an icon's fearlessness to venture into, and nearly create a new genre of music. The film showcases ballroom music in a pop/electronic aspect, provides an in-depth look into the behind the scenes action of the film, but most notably a glimpse into a sentimental part of the life of Beyoncé - honoring her Uncle Johnny who was an important part of her early life and stardom. The well-rounded performances are only a fraction of what the star has to offer to the entertainment industry."
Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023),What a beautiful show.,"Full of life, inspiration, tears, etc. Beyonce, what a job well done on this movie. The movie was such an innovative work of art to say the least. The transitions, the realness, the quality, oh my gosh what a work of art. The Beyoncé Renaissance film marked a transformative moment in the intersection of music, art, and cultural expression. Released as a visual album, it seamlessly blended storytelling with Beyoncé's musical prowess, creating a cinematic experience that transcended conventional boundaries. This groundbreaking work, often referred to as a film due to its narrative structure, is a testament to Beyoncé's ability to redefine artistic mediums. One of the film's strengths lies in its visual storytelling. Each song serves as a chapter, weaving a cohesive narrative that explores themes of identity and empowerment. The visual aesthetics are a feast for the eyes, with stunning cinematography that captures the essence of each track. From intimate moments to grandiose set pieces, the film is a visual spectacle that enhances the emotional impact of the music. Beyoncé's commitment to celebrating LGBTQ+ and heritage is a central theme throughout the film. The use of rich symbolism, vibrant colors, and diverse landscapes pays homage to the groups diverse culture. It goes beyond mere aesthetic choices, becoming a powerful statement on the importance of pride and unity. This celebration resonates globally, fostering a sense of inclusivity and appreciation for the richness of LGBT greatness. Moreover, the film is a showcase of Beyoncé's artistic evolution. Her ability to experiment with genres while maintaining a cohesive narrative is commendable. From soulful ballads to energetic anthems, each song contributes to the film's emotional depth. It reflects not only her musical versatility but also her growth as an artist unafraid to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. The incorporation of social commentary adds another layer of complexity to the Beyoncé Renaissance film. It addresses issues such as racial injustice, gender inequality, and the power dynamics inherent in the entertainment industry. By intertwining these themes with her personal narrative, Beyoncé transforms the film into a platform for meaningful discourse, encouraging viewers to reflect on societal challenges while celebrating resilience and triumph. In essence, the Beyoncé Renaissance film is a masterful convergence of music, storytelling, and visual artistry. Its impact extends beyond the realm of traditional albums or films, solidifying Beyoncé's status as a cultural icon. By pushing artistic boundaries and addressing relevant social issues, she has created a work that resonates with audiences on a profound level. This film not only cements Beyoncé's place in the pantheon of musical legends but also sets a new standard for the potential of visual storytelling in the modern era."
Occupied City (2023),A monumental undertaking,"Occupied City is a very odd documentary, comprised of very distinct images and texts. The images are all of Amsterdam between 2020 and 2023, featuring daily life on the streets: the canals, houses, traffic, people. There are the summers with people lying in the parks and winters with ice skating on the canals. Throughout the film you can see the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, like a big demonstration against governmental measures against the spread of the virus, but also demonstrations against systemic racism, against climate change, remembrance days like May 4th and Keti Koti, the opening of the Holocaust Names Monument, the arrival of the first Ukrainian refugees and also celebrations like King's Day and the arrival of Saint Nicholas. Lastly there are images of - and sometimes inside - buildings and other places that are connected to stories of the second world war and the Nazi occupation. It's a beautifully shot ""day in the life"" documentary if you just watch the images. The texts (in Dutch voiced by actrice Carice van Houten or in the English version by Melanie Hyams) is comprised of snippets from the book ""Atlas of an Occupied City"" written by historian Bianca Stigter, who is also McQueen's wife. Dozens, if not hundreds of little stories connected to an address. Of jews hiding from the Nazis, of resistance against occupation and collaboration with the occupiers. Sometimes the text complements the images very well, especially when they film from inside the buildings from the stories. Watching people living their lives at places with such a rich and horrific history is sobering. Sometimes (especially after an hour or 3) you find yourself just watching the images, because it's very hard to concentrate on both the image and text at the same time. Just watching the film can be very meditative at times, until you catch another ""...and then they were executed in a concentration camp in 1944...."" and you realize what you are watching. There are so many stories, dates, names, deaths, that it's almost numbing. I've lived in Amsterdam for a long time and I recognize a lot of places and all of the events in the film. I've lived in places that had connections to the war, and I've always been conscious of events that took place at places that I know. I was even watching the film in the ""City"" theater that is featured in the film. So for me it was almost a pleasantly recognizable (if also a very very very very long) watch. To be honest, if you already know many of the things that happened during the war, it's not even that confronting anymore; it's simply the sheer volume of the stories that is overwhelming. I think the absence of interviews and explanations of the images will be confusing to those who don't know the city and don't know what's going on on screen. All in all, it's a monumental undertaking: years of filming, dozens of stories, 4 hour watch time, to try and connect the stories of occupied Amsterdam to those places in the present. It's a piece of art more than a documentary. I would recommend it especially for people who already have a connection with Amsterdam, who either live there or have a particular interest."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),"Fun and Smart as usual, But not Perfect","Trevor Noah makes use of his already well known abilities to deliver great performances, his accents are fantastic, he is likeable, relatable, and a pleasure to listen to. As usual, his comedy is clean, his speech is perfect. Noah's trademark comedy which doesn't relly on over the top outrageousness and foul language is trully refreshing. Lastly, IMDB declined my first review, I suppose freedom of speech isn't a thing when it comes to some sensitive topics, even though comedians joke about them constantly, and it's fine. All I'm saying is that one section of this special disappointed me and that's why it my rating is low this time."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),"Tough to Watch, Even for Trevor Noah","I've tried to give him a chance multiple times over the years and I really wanted to like him, but ultimately, Trevor Noah just isn't great at stand-up. The guy just isn't funny. From his timing, to his topics, to the material itself, he just falls flat. I chuckled absentmindedly once or twice during this special, but otherwise, it more or less just amounted to me rolling my eyes for an hour. Again, he's never been funny, but this is really his worst showing that I've seen. It's really too bad. I was hoping for something better from him post-Daily Show, but this will likely be the last of my time I invest in him."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),NOT funny,"Starts bad mouthing America 7 minutes in. Nothing was even remotely humerus. He used to be so funny when he told jokes and things that comedians do. Before he started bashing America he went on for 7 minutes praising Berlin, Germany. 🤦 He was so unfunny I had to turn it off. What the heck happened to Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert and his dancing syringes, Jimmy Kimmel and that Ofallon guy.? They used to be hilarious but now they just lecture and give their unpopular political opinions instead of telling jokes. I wonder who has what on who to make them say such unfunny garbage. What I could stomach of this special was not even close to funny."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),"Right here, right now","No pun intended - I mean the title of his show already is a pun, so what could I add? Well I reckon I found something to add. That aside let's get into Trevor himself. I had a bit of an issue with him when I ""discovered"" him. That's quite a stretch actually - he took over the Daily Show, he already was doing shows and stuff. But he was replacing Jon Stewart ... how could he? How could anyone? But whoever was responsible for that decision ... I salute you! I reckon it was more than one person who made this possible. After a bit of time to warm up to him, I could see the differences ... and relish in them and enjoy them. I may still have some issues or disagree here and there, but that is more than normal ... no one human is the same as the other. And yet he is probably one of the most decent comedics out there. So you will not find too many things that will offend the same way that Ricky Gervais offends with ... Trevor is not that kind of comedian! Take it or leave it one might say. And I reckon he may talk way too much about Germany and France for Americans ... but he tries to bring some outside perspective to the US ... you have to applaud that. And while I don't think all the points he is making are 100% right, it is interesting to see him expanding and really maturing and becoming more knowledgeable! He knows: you always can learn more! And he does just do that. And he tries to ""teach"" us too. Not in a bad way - or in the sense of ""I know more than you"". No it never comes of as demeaning. One thing is for sure: no matter where he goes - he will never be lost! (yes I just did that - with his help)"
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),You'll definitely laugh,"This guy is awesome. He is one of the comedians i always enjoy because his stand ups are always so clean and so pure and smart. No swear words or vurglar language. Also the humor is not based on sexist jokes about women but really smart points on how he views the world. This one is based on jokes about countries and people all over the world and once again i give it 10/10 because he does not try to force the jokes, but he's genuine and really careful with words, which modern stand up comedy is missing. It's been a long time since i laughed with a stand up more than 5 times throughout the show, but this one did the trick. It's hard to be genuine nowadays and i hope Trevor Noah does not change his style of being respectfully funny."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),Come back home maybe ..,"The first few minutes was funny but then the rest of it didn't feel as natural as when I first used to watch Trevor Noah. Maybe these a need to come back to the mother land and rediscover your mojo, maybe....i don't know. It just wasn't as funny as his previous stand ups. But I did get a chuckle or two out of it so his true comedic genius is in there somewhere and I will admit his education on the history of Germany was quite enlightening for me who does love to know a bit of history, whether that would be something to at appeals to everyone is up for debate. I do think Trevor is his strongest when he compares African cultures with other cultures, because his roots are natural to him so you can tell his not trying too hard."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),"Good, Clean Fun","Yes, its not over the top hilarious and Trevor Noah took his time to tell the first joke but it was enjoyable. Its not your typical cuss words, swearing, Eff this, Eff that stand up routine... Its an intellectual and well-written show which you can enjoy with the whole family. Also, if you are familiar with Trevor Noah's work - he always has the political, national theme to his work even before The Daily Show. It is clean, well-written with some hard hitting facts which honestly comedian deliver way better than any of the politicians or people claiming to be on the ""right"" side of the things and an hour well spent."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),What a waste of my time!,"I used to like his comedy, but I think he's lost his mojo now. First 11 minutes of the show, he couldn't even get a chuckle out of me. Next 6 minutes I watched this show skipping 20 seconds, still no comedy. Its just his opinions about a thing. No idea how this show gets these ratings. If you have liked his comedy before, I guarantee you wont like this one. Not at least the first 16 minutes, I couldn't afford to waste more time of my life on this crap. People in the theatre are probably laughing because they've paid for the tickets and have no other bloody option but to laugh at nothing at all. Looking at an ant losing its way and bumping into a wall would have gotten more laughter from me than what Trevor presented here."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),post the daily show,"From detroit michigan, after hosting the daily show for so long. That must have been difficult to give up. A sixty eight minute standup special on netflix. He touches briefly on the dark history of germany. The history of columbus day in the united states. The use of public bathrooms.. by anyone! Gay marriage. Star wars. Germany and its new national anthem. Funny stuff. Cheerleaders and their past dating life. Lost luggage, and being left behind by his mother. Shopping in paris. And why there are so many tornados in the midwest. Trevor's history, and how he came to be where he is now. It's pretty funny! Directed by david meyer, also a long timer at the daily show."
Trevor Noah: Where Was I (2023),"Not earth-shattering, but comfortable and very funny.","Firstly, I miss Trevor so very much. Quick-witted and brilliant and more worldly than people three times his age. ""Where Was I"", was less stand-up and more of story telling experience; perhaps, a little TED-talky. I laughed a lot and loved his affable silliness; his impressions are world-class. He did kept it pretty light and could have elaborated a bit more on a few issues where I felt he skirted them a bit. I won't give anything away; you'll have to be the judge. Nothing earth shattering was introduced which is a bit unusually for Trevor. He is the rare comedian with the chops and the intelligence to pull off ""Earth-Shattering"". But... if I'm honest... I don't always want my earth shattered by a comedian. (BTW... if you haven't read Born a Crime... you should. ;-)"
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Honest and Important,"I am a survivor of abuse, and the family dynamic that was captured in this documentary was all too familiar to me. I also have heard stories from fellow survivors that are almost verbatim. It is wild to me just how similarly these events transpire but often they are covered up or explained away. I personally never got the same closure when confronting my abusers as the subjects did in this film. I'm encouraged and impressed that these people were able to be so transparent and vulnerable and willing to confront the truths of what happened to them, and maintain their relationships. It's my great hope that films like this are a cultural tipping point towards accountability and true justice."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)","Uncomfortable, but for the wrong reasons","What was the purpose? He didnt went to jail again, noone got closure, no laws were changed, he wasnt even confronted the right way, the family didnt heal and he even did his thing one last time in his final days! We can excuse everything with creating ""awareness"" but its just too trivial in my opinion. I feel she used his whole family suffering to create this documentary. There we're too many shots where she was the ""movie star"". I know it wasnt an easy documentary to create because of the emocional connection, but i think that affected the whole project. Im just happy it ended. The topic behind this piece is really serious and has to be talked about (or screamed) but in some points it was just the excuse to show drama. From a technical stand point i really likes the cinematography and the edition, it makes you feel a lot of things and that is what art is supposed to do. I cant rate this."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Realistic dysfunctional family doc,"I felt that the doc portrays exactly how thousands of dysfynctional families get through lifetimes of abuse. Trying to keep secrets that just end up destroying them from the inside and sadly repeating generations. Secrets are an abusers best weapon. I noticed religion placing forgiveness as more important than holding perps accountable seemed to really stunt healing for some here. Many people use that way of dealing with hardship. To place it all in God's hands to deal with..but I say that gives the secrets more power and perps the privilege to continue on their merry way without confrontation. This film highlights how people can mix together(and confuse) the true love and trust children have for a parent (grandparents) with the ill-willed abusers demands for ""love"", respect. Sexual abuse, secrets and then abuser gaslighting were the main dysfunctional features for this family. I felt we peeked over their wall of secrets and gained some useful insight. I applaud her for shining light into a very dark corner. Was she therapeutic? She tried- but not really. She was realistic and raw. I'm actually shocked she was so brave and vocal- considering the women of her family being so sheepish and controlled. Was there a perfect ""accountability bow"" on the whole package in the end?... no. She did try, but such is life...messy without the big happy ending sometimes. And it's OK to not be OK. There WAS progress for healing in some and discussion for our awareness and for that- An Absolute Triumph. *Unhide secrets. Talk!! Hold abusers accountable. *"
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",I'm glad it was made.... I wish it had a different outcome for the pedophile. He should have been taken in and charged for committing the crime AGAIN! The cycle didn't stop.,"I wish it had different circumstances for the monstrous pedophile. Why didn't they seek more people to file against him. He was a serial predator in children, even in his old age. He didn't STOP being an abuser and molester being old. Too many victims that were left behind without closure to see him behind bars. It's so sad to see the victims continue to be in pain from all the suffering from their trauma. A true Closure for victims is to see the person who abused them behind bars. I say that as a victim myself. I wish the mother owned up to her delusion in thinking that it wouldn't happen to her children under the roof of the monsters house. Her mother allowed it to happen to her, she allowed it to happen to her grandchildren. That's the unfortunate reality in life, once an abuser, always an abuser. They continue to sexually abuse and assault children. I broke my silence, I lost members in my family and also gained supporters in believing me. But I also found another victim (my cousin) in my family. As I said, they have multiple victims. Sometimes, we need to speak the truth. Even if your abuse happened in the past or is currently happening. Victims at a young age don't know or understand what is happening. You don't know until you get older. I kept the silence because I was afraid of not being believed or heard. I became courageous and brave enough to break the silence. Yes, I had therapy and counseling. Group therapy works wonders. BREAK THE SILENCE TO STOP THE CYCLE of ABUSE!"
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Savior complex driven trainwreck,"This is an example of people who take on others perceived issues and feel the need to wrap themselves in said issues to be a savior for these people, whether they want or need one. Her grandfather should be in jail. But his victims need to find peace for themselves. It is not his granddaughter's burden or responsibility to be involved. This is her own twisted way of dealing with the crime perpetuated on her. When she stated while she may never get justice for herself, maybe she could get justice for others against her grandfather, I knew this was a trainwreck. I literally gagged in shock when she wrote potential victims letters asking for information about crimes that her grandfather may have perpetuated on them, with NO CONCERN for those victims and where they were in their own journeys. This is a vanity project for a very self important self absorbed troubled young woman. It's nauseating to watch her exhilaration at hearing the victims after the first thing the victim asked, ""How did you find me?"" You hear the pain in the victim's voice as she hears about the volume of victims. This creator is just rubbing salt in wounds and her ego is not going to soothe it. And her mother knew for years and never went to the police. She just tried to get her mom to run away. I obviously could not watch the entire film."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Stunning and nuanced,"This is without a doubt one of the strongest and most self-aware documentaries I have ever seen. Beautiful visuals and nuanced delivery. It feels like I'm experiencing someone's memories firsthand. The film rings so true to family dysfunction - and the complex ways that the human mind processes that dysfunction in order to protect ourselves. It tracks many years in the life of the family, so we see through the camerawoman's eyes how family dynamics play out both short-term and long-term. It's honest and heartfelt. So many documentaries go overboard with exposition and oversimplify trauma. This one doesn't. Highly recommend."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",OMG! Can't finish it.,"Nope. Can't watch anymore than the 30 minutes I have endured with this complex family who was allowed to endure (thanks to the mothers and a horrible court system at the time) such atrocities by a man who explains that they wanted ""it"". And that he was instructing them. As a child, I was protected by a Scottish Tiger of a mother from anyone who thought of causing harm or distress. Sadly, most women have all met these lowlifes in all phases of our lives. Work, play, and in the home of friends who have forgiven their abusers and then turned them loose on their friends. Men also have their versions of this living, breathing tolerated nightmare. My inability to watch it to the end is because of the rawness of this project and how personal it is. That said, it obviously re-awoke things in me that created much less than a lovely life."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Awful Circumstance. Selfish Production,"Obviously this entire documentary surrounds a horrible human and an innumerable number of atteocities. What no one seems to ask during this documentary, is who benefits from tearing this whole thing open again for the victims...it seems as a self serving documtary where the main character stands on the shoulders of the victims to produce a documentary that none of them asked for. I hope and pray the victims reach some catarsis and that Amanda Mustard defers any and all monetary benefits and awards to the victims she opens up to the trauma they may have burried. She seems to actually try to convince people that they are not handling things the way she wants them to. Her own relatives... Self centered about approach to making a serious issue about herself. How could you possibly make this about yourself? Gut wrenching and disappointing."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Misunderstanding Forgiveness,"This film is an okay film. It's about personal experience, so I'm sure to those who've had similar experiences will connect with this film more than I did. The thing that frustrates me about this film is that all of these people are saying that they want to move past the trauma they suffered, yet they are totally unwilling to forgive their attackers. They clearly do not understand what forgiveness means. Forgiving somebody (for whatever they may have done) is for the benefit of the person who was wronged, not the person who did wrong. Forgiveness means letting go and moving on, not forgetting what happened. In fact, we should not forget what happened, as that would put us at risk of these things happening all over again. I hope that all of these women will forgive this man, not to excuse or forget what he did, but so that they can move forward in their lives. Otherwise, they may will themselves along through life, but they will do so as victims and they will become increasingly more bitter."
"Great Photo, Lovely Life (2023)",Hard-hitting and devastating on many levels,"As ""Great Photo, Lively Life"" (2023 release; 112 min.) opens, we are with Amanda and her mom Debbie, who are visiting Amanda's grandpa (Debbie's dad) in Florida, ready to finally confront him over the sexual abuses of many young girls all this years ago. He doesn't deny any of it, and in fact goes one further. We then go back in time to the 1970s in Bradford, PA, where he worked as a chiropractor. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie. Couple of comments: this movie is co-directed by Rachel Beth Anderson (""Unschooled"") and Amanda Mustard, making her directing debut. The movie is a hard-hitting, if not shocking, but certainly devastating look back to the speechless acts of sexual abuse over many years by her grandfather, and the long-term consequences for the family and the victims. The grandfather shows no signs of remorse, zero, and explains it all like you would explain buying a loaf of bread at the grocery store, To Amanda's immense credit, she does not shy away from the difficult moments, and plows on to get to the bottom of this, including the responsibilities of the people around her grandfather, including i=his wife and yes, Amanda's mother. Please note that this will make many viewers uncomfortable, as surely I was. ""Great Photo, Lovely Life"" premiered at SXSW earlier this year to immediate critical acclaim. It started airing on HBO 2 weeks ago and it is also streaming on Max, where I caught it. If you want to understand the truly devastating effects of a serial pedophile on his victims, his family, and society as a while, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
Dr. Death: Cutthroat Conman (2023),A proposal that kills a reputation,"Macchiarini's experimental trachea patients did not heal, In fact, they were dying. However, Macchiarini was still coasting on the glowing publicity that followed their initial surgeries, leaving two of his colleagues at prestigious Karolinska Institute to deal with the carnage of his dubious treatment. Together they wrote a damning report exposing Macchiarini's falsified research. Perhaps predictably, the Karolinska administers turned on the whistleblowers rather than its cash cow. Meanwhile, Italian doctor started to have an affair which undoubtedly caused to shadow his reputation , as the journalist lover got suspicious of his pre-marriage promises. What would be like if he did not propose to him? Better if you look from that perspective???"
Take Care of Maya (2023),Biased and completely lacking in actual facts,This was a great story if this narrative were true. It's not. It's pretty sad the producers didn't actually READ and include more than 3 minutes of the more than THOUSANDS of pages of depositions. The mother in this story very clearly was medically abusing her daughter. The trail of red flags were so loud and clear when I watched this show I couldn't believe it. I know it's really hard to believe a mom is capable of such a thing but it happens more than we'd like to think. Beata was actually a text book case. It is so clear the ambulance chasing lawyers who represented the Kowalski's in their very successful civil trial had a strategy and it worked. Get this narrative out and play on the emotions of Americans who are skeptical and deniers of medicine and facts. What is sad is this could have serious implications in the real world for mandatory reporters of suspected abuse. Do I think our child protective systems in this country need change? Yes of course. Do I believe people do get falsely accused at times? Yes of course. Just not in THIS case. This family is not credible and the FACTS don't line up with what comes out of their mouth for the media.
Take Care of Maya (2023),Very compelling power plays,"First of all, the true victim is Maya and I hope she is feeling supported and thriving. It seemed that she was doing well in her teen years and after being off the high dosage of Ketamine. Perhaps it helped in the beginning of her illness, but eventually it caused her stomach pain and that was rectified by her coming off of it eventually. I feel the mother had no support, she was already struggling with her mental health obviously from being the primary caretaker of her daughter and doing all of the research and care and trying to find doctors to listen and help. Everyone always forgets to care for the caretaker. Caretakers are at risk for attempting suicide much more than the average person. The hospital staff didn't like the mother because she was outspoken and that's true, most doctors don't like when you advocate. The father wasn't as involved in Maya's care and couldn't even answer basic questions about doctors they saw or didn't see once his wife had passed. He certainly didn't provide emotional support for his wife. He caved the second the hospital tried to pin them against each other. It's not surprising that the mother took her own life. She felt it was the only way to get her daughter back home. She sacrificed herself for her daughter. I do feel the mother had mental health issues, I think the fact that she obsessively wrote everything down that had to do with her daughter's illness was inductive of high levels of anxiety, but I don't think she had Munchussin by proxy. The hospital does need to take ownership of what happened and the abuse they did to this family based on falsehoods. The father needs to take ownership of providing no support for his wife. When mothers are not supported in any capacity, children do not thrive."
Take Care of Maya (2023),is there going to be a book and a movie,The Netflix documentary only explains about Maya Kowalski's medical journey not the whole story about how she get sick and what happened at all children's hospital for these 3 months if there is a book and a movie about Maya Kowalski's it would explain about Maya's journey before she was diagnosis with CRPS and after. And how Maya is coping with the grief of losing her mother Beata and how the children's hospital's around the world need to know to deal with this kind of disease in the future. And in all Hospital's including children's hospital's and Family services needs to be overhauled...
Take Care of Maya (2023),Thoughts on hospital,"Okay. Let's say you're a hospital and genuinely concerned that a little girl is being abused. To investigate abuse shouldn't be an 87 day thing. Maybe a week at most. As soon as the hospital found the previous doctor that treated the disease and verified the dosage this should have been case closed. They made her situation much worse. Wheel chair bound. The hospital were abusing her. It goes to show the repeated pattern of people with invisible diseases being at high risk of being treated very badly not just by doctors but also by their peers. Really, any parent could take their kid in for a disease and then be accused of something? Invisible sand rare diseases could be at greater risk? This should be a higher red flag and warning to everyone both parents and medical staff that they need to be faster and fairer in seeing the situation."
Take Care of Maya (2023),Medical field can me evil be careful and god bless you citizens,"People have to start realizing that this country is not any better than a 3rd world country, you have poverty outside you door step, everywhere you go you see filth etc, I lived in Mexico and tbh USA and its laws followed by corruption is at the same level, it is very sad how countries are slowly rotting by peoples actions, this story reminds me how a pce of s****t the world is that so seek medical help you have to do more because doctors are just a business too they don't care about you, I detest doctors they all lie they are clueless, really ironic how see had to go somewhere else to get medical help smh."
Take Care of Maya (2023),Hospital found guilty,"A real harrowing story for any parent.. being falsely accused of abusing their precious children For those saying the mother was mentally ill and was guilty of Munchausen by proxy should know that on the 10th November 2023 John Hopkins Hospital was found liable on abuse charges in relation to this case. Regardless of the mother's mental health, the way the court system so callously prolonged this families pursuit of justice is shameful. What those poor kids were put through was awful. It's good that hospitals look for child neglect but this show proves that not all hospitals act justly.. employing a nurse that had been charged with abuse."
Take Care of Maya (2023),So very difficult to watch but so very necessary!,"As an adult who ended up with RSD (CRPS) in my dominant hand after carpal tunnel surgery 31 years ago, I can say that is has totally changed my life for the worse. I can't imagine having it all over my body. But, this isn't about me. This movie is so important for many reasons. I only hope that hospitals and their staff watch this. My heart, thoughts and prayers go out to this family for all they've been through (and all other families) who have and continue to go through this horror. I hope that changes are made in all hospitals in regard to treating children and families. There should always be second, third and fourth opinions from different doctors and hospitals when it comes to tearing families apart. There are so many underlying conditions that aren't obvious. Unfortunately, they don't pop up like little bubbles in a comic book to say what's wrong with someone. No one should ever go through what this family went through. Thanks for sharing all the trauma (I'm sorry for that) but, it may help so many people."
Take Care of Maya (2023),Significant Milestone for Chronic Illness Patients,"I watched this documentary because the Kowalski family's story has been shared in various forms for a long time within the chronic pain community but I didn't know any of the specifics within their family. However, when Maya Kowalski made headlines earlier this week for winning a $230 million lawsuit against John's Hopkins All Children's Hospital, I knew there was significant malpractice and had to know more. The film does a good job with pacing, thoroughly documenting everything they went through and keeping the timeline of the events very clear. The Kowalski family remains at the center of the story, but the documentary also does the important work of covering the wider issue that isn't yet making news. Not only did I walk away feeling like I had a thorough understanding of the facts, but also the emotional toll that John's Hopkins All Children's Hospital specifically put them through for months and the lasting impact it had on their lives. The editing of home videos together with video footage of her appointments with specialists provide a very clear picture of how much her parents loved their daughter and were attentive to her care from the very beginning and the editing of all of it together with the testimony of how the hospital workers who tried to discount and discredit their parenting and plans for her healthcare. I think it's an important watch for everyone who is involved with the general public frequently, especially with children or in a healthcare capacity. The awareness that this film is spreading in terms of which hospital paperwork to never sign is vital for parents and guardians. Now that the lawsuit has been concluded (events that happened after the documentary was released) and John's Hopkins have been found guilty on every charge, the future is hopefully going to change for the better in terms of invisible disabilities and chronic conditions. The spotlight this documentary has shined on the world is so important and I found out it is a much bigger problem than I ever thought."

Take Care of Maya (2023),A rich family trying to hide mental health with embellishment,This movies is straight lies. Go do your actual research. Beata is a mentally unstable mother abusing her child by munchausen by proxy. This is a disgusting cover up of a child that's been abused since birth by mentally unstable parents. Please don't watch this and support them. Watch the trial and hear the truth and support Maya. The victim. She's now having go through even more trauma as everything is being disected in court files for money of course. Honestly this story is close to Gypsy Rose but the parents were caught and the main abuser is now gone. Hopefully we see the real story ans not a PSA for a rich family before they go to trial in an attempt to sway rhe public for them.
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Heavy message brought with a smile,"This documentary is so great, it reveals everything about the battle Michael has with Parkinson's disease and especially on how it helps to be open about the disease when you have it. I hope Michael will live long and still have a chance on talking and being with his loved ones! Also the care and love he receives from his family is heartwarming! Very nice to see how his movie and series footage is used to give a picture to the words he speaks. This makes it a very nice movie to watch. Even when the message he is sending is not positive, the way this movie brings it makes it positive! I think with making this movie, the foundation for funding research will receive more needed donations! Great work Michael and keep it up! You're movies and series brought a lot of fun and entertainment, this one brings knowledge and understanding and that with a laugh!"
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),"Tough To Watch, But You'll Be Glad You did","The movie is a tour de force of editing, telling the story with bits and pieces of his movies and TV appearances, actor doubles, and the man himself after he's been battling a horrible disease for decades. The documentary is brutally honest and thus terrifying to think how a deadly and incurable disease can just touch anyone. It will bring him down, but damn, not without him kicking and screaming the whole way. I seriously doubt I could face what MJF has faced. The most horrible aspect of the disease-for me-was seeing how he is constantly hurting himself in falls, just doing what all of us do every day. As I get older, I've incurred injuries doing mundane things. His problems are amplified, but all of us become susceptible to the forces of gravity-as he joked-as we get older. I was never what you would call a Michael J. Fox fan as I didn't watch much TV back when he was on, and Back to the Future came out when I was 27 years old, so too old to really be its target audience. He just seemed like a nice kid with an admirable career. I'm glad that I watched this."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Thanks,"Well what can one say about such a courageous movie, in which his every touch is his own. I learned so much about him in general.. his career he really deserved every bit of it. He always felt like a super descent guy, watching all his movies growing up as a kid. A very feel-good kinda actor. Someone who's ego rarely seemed to get in front of him. Further my grandfather died of Parkingson.. well, he met his end because of it. It goes so quick suddenly, and clings on to a person and thats it. The movements.. the facial expressions.. the kindness all so frozen up.. touches base quite hard. Its so lovely he is fighting and still joking about, being true to himself. Genuine. To me personally, a very touching film. Please watch. As I know his main idea was spreading awareness and helping It must take massive will-power to keep going, ..one thing i know the disease cant do is kill that spark deep inside to tell a joke , and to enjoy seeing people smile. One of the most sad moments, last moments I can remember of my grandpa is him wanting to tell a joke around the xmas dinner table.. and not being able to really finish it. And even when we laughed at what we knew was supposed to be a joke, he knew it wasnt funny, that the punchline was missing, the look in his eyes was heartbreaking.."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),What You Didn't Know...,"""Still"" delves into the boundless depths of Michael J. Fox's soul. Ultimately leaving him exposed so much so, that your heart will struggle NOT break. This documentary, without fail, silently yet vigilantly applauds Michael's unrelenting strength to fight and all the while, simultaneously exposes and elevates his scored Achilles' heels marred by an overwhelmingly depraved masterful weakness that cloaked him in remorseless comfort and eventually seduced him into to a downtrodden weary submission. Michael J. Fox unflinchingly thwarts the viewers natural exertions to feel sorry for him. The frankness in which he eloquently conveys and displays numerous raw cases in points to support his justification, imparts that he is in this battle for the long haul. This documentary is provoking. Measured. Wrenching. Considerate. Alluring. Funny. Prophetic. Captivating. Profoundly Honest. ...And, a must see."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),"Wow, just wow","Best documentary I have seen in a while. Raw and emotional and very moving. What a courageous man!! From extremely humble beginnings to extreme fame and back to a very humble life full of challenges and strength. I was inspired throughout and in aw of his courage. It will pull at your emotions, but truly amazing. I highly recommend watching this documentary, So inspiring and heartfelt. You get to go back in time to see his initial struggles, watch him make it big and then see him maneuver the diagnosis and creatively hide it for years. You can feel the relief when he finally comes forward, and what a strong human he is!!"
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),You are only as sick as your secrets,"This is a masterfully crafted documentary linking footage of MJF's acting scenes - the ""make believe"" to the reality of his life. I haven't seen anything quite like this before. It's uniquely done. MJF definitely has a story to tell and not at all for selfish reasons. I believe this is Oscar worthy because on so many levels this is a masterpiece. We could say that having to have lived and endured Parkinsons for so long is a tragedy but in my opinion thank God he can use his fame to reveal the truth on how he has learned to survive so long like a true soldier. His dad would be very proud. Like Terry Fox, Michael J Fox is able to reach and inspire so many. It is not surprising that his tenacity endures. That grit was there long before Parkinsons. It's inspiring to watch."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Fascinating!,"Maybe it's my age, but Michael J. Fox was always one of my favorite actors. This is an excellent documentary about his life and his ultimate struggle with Parkinson's Disease which manifested when he was just 29. In his mind it was payback for his major success. He kept it hidden for seven years and it was no easy task. Much of this documentary was like watching my memories of him. From Family Ties(that I loved) to the 3 Back to the Future movies( that I also loved) to the television show Spin City and all the movies he made in between was discussed. We watch as his disease progresses and that was very sad to witness. Through it all we see his wonderful relationship with his wife Tracey and their 4 children. I was fascinated throughout."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Brilliant biopic,"The BTTF franchise was part of my early adulthood. I still remember going to the first movie in 1985 and enjoying it completely. I never really watched any of Fox's earlier work, but I may look into it having now seen this doc. This documentary is a terrific look at the ascent and the amazing long ride of this talented actor. His honesty about his disease and the way in which he discloses its horrible appearance in his life is compelling and chilling. I was also quite impressed with the way that the director used old footage and intercuts of recreated backstory to fill out the entire production. (Honestly I was waiting for it to descend into some Hollywood wokeness, but it never went there. A refreshing change.) A must see for anyone who has a Parkinson's patient in their lives. It is brilliant."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Nothing Short of 10 Stars,"I am perplexed by all of the glowing reviews for the movie made by viewers who rated this film 7-8 stars. This films is the epitome of genius and bravery. MJF's story is painful and heartwarming at the same time. The sprinkling in of old footage is so clever and entertaining. I sat there thinking how creative the director and editor are! I have a dear sister with a Parkinson's-like disease (PSP) and this film really connected with me and our family experience. People, this film should be rated nothing short of 10 stars based on the sheer bravery of MJF sitting in front of a camera telling his story in such a honest, raw way. If I could, I would rate it 11 out of 10 stars. Thank you to MJF and his very talented team of film makers for this very special film."
Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (II) (2023),Emotional and to the point.,"Disclaimer: I consider my review biased.. As this a documentary, you can not view this from the acting point. However in a directors point of view it is very nice they way that many actual movie scenes are used to present the real life of M. J. Fox events. Watching M. J. Fox was as if I was seeing my late father who had Parkinsons for almost 25 years (he discovered it at his early 50s). All of his movements, the way he talks, the way he holds his hand in front of his face, his facial expressions, his freezing, his falls. This touched some delicate chords in me, and brought up memories... This movie is the best way for someone to understand the basic challenges of a PD patient. It is a fight with the disease and day to day , month to month gets more and more difficult. It needs courage, psychological support and patience. My father also had an operation to install a deep brain stimulation device, which helped him but later created issues. The most important lesson however from the movie is that you need to acknowledge mainly to yourself that you have PD and you need to fight up to the last minute. MJF and my father were lucky to have a spouse that gave full support."
The Deepest Breath (2023),"A haunting, thrilling, eerie adventure","This is a powerful documentary about extreme sport Freediving, and the athletes who risk their lives to probe the abyss of the ocean (""the last quiet place on earth"") as well as the deepest terrain of their souls and physical capabilities, alone and powered by only a single breath. This is a real-life thriller/love story/sports documentary/psychological study, and I encourage you to go in cold without doing any research about the fates of the people involved. What motivates these athletes to risk their lives to be utterly alone and unreachable in dark, dangerous, uncharted territory where they cannot be rescued, and then also risk deeply loving another who shares this need for life-threatening, extreme isolation and self-reliance? And the greatest irony of all is that the unexpected love story at the center of this film may end up being more dangerous than the sport itself. For me, this documentary is the most powerful, haunting, beautiful, and thought-provoking movie (in any genre) this year."
The Deepest Breath (2023),What a story,"I don't want to spoil too much because that's not fair, but I simply think this documentary is exemplary. It takes an extremely egocentric and, let's face it, stupid hobby and makes it interesting due to personalities ans setup in the script. It's been a while since I have seen a movie where tears didn't just appear but they were literally rolling down my cheeks. Life is generally unfair and I can't grasp why she keeps going after everything that has happened to her. I would definitely recommend everyone to see this documentary, but please have your Kleenex ready, because this one is not a fairytale."
The Deepest Breath (2023),Some Humans are Amazing,"Free diving is an extreme sport and not for the faint of heart. Two people both found their way to it. One is a world champion diver, and the other is the best safety diver in the world. This is the story of how they became who they are and how their paths crossed and changed the sport. This is an exhilarating film about free diving and two people contributing to the sport. The film does a great job breaking down the sport's history, identifying all the critical people in the sport, explaining how it is done, the science behind it, and the associated risks. The footage of the dives is awe-inspiring and shows how deep and unknown the ocean truly is. This is an excellent documentary to learn something new and to see some breathtaking images of the depths of different seas and oceans worldwide. Stream it on Netflix for your next movie night."
The Deepest Breath (2023),Poor structure & dislikeable lead,"Where to begin. First, the biggest structural mistake in a documentary is to treat the audience as stupid. This documentary does that tremendously well. 10/10 for that. It frames everything with a build up to a climax, only to bait and switch the climax on the assumption you dont know the story or you wouldnt look it up prior to watching. In this day and age its a cardinal sin to assume this. Its also why a documentary like Senna is one of the greats. Kapadia doesnt assume the audience is stupid and everyone knows the end, so its more about the journey. Here, its as though youre taken on one journey only to fall down a ""lets pretend secret"" trapdoor. 0/10. Second main flaw is the main character isnt very likeable and that seems to be the case from start to finish. 0/10. Otherwise it was well made. This is where the 5 marks came from. Ps. What an utterly stupid activity."
The Deepest Breath (2023),Still holding my breath...,"A fascinating dive into the world of free diving which keeps you on the edge of your seat and cycles through your emotions. The Deepest Breath plunges into the extreme sport of free driving. Athletes dive underwater to depths of over 90 meters on a single breath without the use of any equipment or scuba gear. Firstly this is available in 4k and it looks absolutely stunning. The Free Divers are competing in some of the most beautiful waters across the globe which gives you a holiday vibe, at least on the surface. Watch it on the best screen you have! The Deepest Breath is one of my all-time favourite extreme sport documentaries, up there with the likes of Dawn Wall and Free Solo. One of the things that makes this so chilling is the fact that the athletes dive down to depths where they can't be helped if things go wrong. However we are able to witness the pursuit thanks to underwater cameras. This means that you on the edge of your seat for every dive regardless of whether you are looking at the underwater or surface level view. The documentary film follows the stories of Stephan Keenan and Alessia Zecchini who are well known faces in the Free Diving world. Alessia and many of those around her are attempting to break World and National records. Naturally, as we meet a whole group of athletes who are pushing the boundaries of human capabilities, there are bound to be close calls and tragedy. This is reflected in the amazing score which portrays a sense of wonder, mystery and sadness. This is a much watch document purely due to the emotions it illicits which includes excitement, disbelief, anxiety, wonder and forbearing sadness."
The Deepest Breath (2023),Emotions and suspense,"From the first pictures of this documentary it is evident that something bad is about to happen. By careful editing the suspense of not knowing what or to whom it will happen is held up until the end. As a result the runtime of almost 2 hours felt more like one. To my taste the documentary is trying a bit too hard emotionally in some scenes, but it works and I did care for most of the characters. While there is some sublime cinematography it feels partly out of place as the rest of the footage does not hold up. The subject matter itself might seem nonsensical to some and the character's true motivation a bit shallow - although sometimes that is all there is."
The Deepest Breath (2023),"Not just Freediving, its about finding yourself, the drive to be the best and human connection","As a person who was profoundly affected as a kid after watching 'The Big Blue', I was looking forward to watching this. I was pleasantly surprised as this documentary is more than just about freediving, its a spiritual and emotional journey about feeling lost in the world and finding yourself, about achieving unimaginable goals, living your dreams and driving to be the best. Its a story of human connection to each other and to the sea. I was deeply moved watching this, its also the perfect example of the fine line between the danger and the beauty of Freediving, the drive of its competitors and the pitfalls and rewards of pushing your limits , i highly recommend this documentary."
The Deepest Breath (2023),Just why???,I just don't get it What is the point? What are these people trying to prove? Insecurity? Ego? Inferiority complex? What is the purpose of all this if you are going to shorten your life in half and die in the process? To have your name written in a records book that nobody cares? Imagine having one single opportunity of living your life on planet earth Imagine being able to live a long and healthy life full of experiences Imagine being able to become a parent Now imagine throwing all of this away and cease to exist in the dumbest way For what really?? A complete disrespect for life. What a waste and how sad.
The Deepest Breath (2023),Good documentary of a pointless sport,"Free diving is probably the most pointless sport I've come across so there is a huge merit in making a documentary about it which is this watchable. During this docco, we see divers putting themselves in danger and putting the safety divers in danger all the time. Among all, Alessia is the most dislikable character as she selfishly and routinely puts herself in danger doing these dangerous dives knowing full well she wasn't prepared for it. At the same time, her charismatic boyfriend loved by all the community is portrayed as this life saving angel who would give his life to safe someone else. The doc reaches its pinnacle when in one of this expected accidents, he dies saving her. Tragic as it is that a great guy lost his life it's difficult to feel sympathy for this people and their sport ."
The Deepest Breath (2023),"""How can one person touch so many?""","I often find myself deeply fascinated by people's passions, at the same time it sometimes frightens me the idea of how the obsession with passion can possibly be the end of you literally and figuratively. What does it really take to go after your passion? And how willing are you to sacrifice for it? I watched this documentary without any knowledge of freediving or the story and it immediately grabbed my attention right from the opening scene, that itself kept me on the edge It's such an interesting element of the story structure how stunning they capture the concept to be as an extreme sport, yet how dangerous of an endeavor it actually is. It shows you both sides of the athlete's obsession about it and the lengths they go for it, which leaves you questioning wanting to understand the depths of satisfaction beyond passion given their lives are at dangerous risks knowingly. The cinematography was stunning, incredible archival footage! It takes you through the diver's journeys from top to underwater beautifully it's sometimes scary. The interviews were heartfelt and informative enough for you to understand a bit of the extreme sport, while at the same time, it maintained sensations and delivered emotionally making you feel for the tragedy and how their story intertwined in destiny."
Daniel (II) (2023),Beautiful story. Terribly depressing. Watch it.,"Like the headline states. It's a beautiful story. But it's also very depressing. Daniel had such an interesting perspective on life. Something many of us can relate to. His journeys and experiences are things we can appreciate, because it's something we all want to see in life. It's a raw insight into the life of an extraordinary young man. A man who lived a life time. A man cut short of the life that could of brought so much more to this world. His journey shows us the beauty and the beasts of the world. The light and darkness that plays a a part of all our lives. He lived and died to tell a story, to show people there's more beauty than beasts and that we can see the extraordinary and live the lives we want to. Live the impossible and be who we want to be."
Daniel (II) (2023),Stunningly beautiful,"Yes! Such a life-affirming movie. About what truly matters. Love, travel, nature, family, friends, people, the beauty of life, art & expression. It's also about loss, karma and acceptance. With people documenting so much of their lives these days on video, it makes for some stellar documentaries. Please watch this movie. It's a rarity to encounter a film that simultaneously captures the raw beauty of life and makes you mourn all who you've lost. I lost my brother eleven years ago and Daniel had me crying cathartic tears of grief. And I related to Daniel's loss of his grandmother to what I assume was dementia. Daniel also made me think about my son who is in a horribly depressed, hopeless and rebellious phase. At least I hope it's a phase. He's really hurting and I can't do anything to help. I hate this. It physically hurts to see your kid in so much pain. And to not feel empowered to do any of the comforting a mother would do, especially as one who shows love via touch. If only my son could see this documentary. He needs an infusion of the life force and demonstration of grace that is both Daniel the person and Daniel the movie (thanks in part to his loving sister who produced). I haven't been as inspired or moved since Anthony Bourdain passed away."
Daniel (II) (2023),Almost wish it was longer,"It's rare in these days of three hour plus movies to say I wish a film was longer, but in this case, I wish it was. It's an interesting film and well worth watching in terms of seeing someone living life to the fullest and suddenly finding themselves, unexpectedly, at the end of it all. My only complaint is at the end of 102 minutes, relatively short these days, that I didn't feel I knew Daniel as well as I could have. From what I understand he filmed over a thousand hours of his life, and this easily could have been a two hour to two and half hour film and I would've felt like I knew him better. On the upside, maybe more people will watch it as it's reasonably short and since it was produced by his sister, maybe she didn't know what best to include or leave out. In the end it would be difficult not to recommend it, as it is one of those ""live life while you can"" kind of stories. I just wish I got to know Daniel a little better over the course of the film and with all the available footage there was, I think the possibility was there."
Daniel (II) (2023),One of the biggest honours of my life to be able to watch this.,"This is the best film ever made, Dan, if you are reading this from across the impossible: i wish i'd know you and give you all the love you deserved, you were a gentleman, a true brother, son, friend, all things aside, You were a beautiful human being. Dan, i've seen all kinds of films, more than a thousand of them, i've never connected myself this close to a film like i have to yours. I dont think there are words in the dictionary to define your presence. Nature chose you to show its immense beauty to the world. You were loved, and you always will be, I'll remember this for the rest of my life."
Daniel (II) (2023),A privileged look inside the mind of someone who saw the world just a little differently.,"This was a really special film, a mosaic of memories perfectly woven together. With thousands of hours of footage of Daniel's life to work with, this could have easily been a bloated film, one that could have been an extended and (understandably) indulgent look at a young man, by family, for family. Instead we get a quilted blanket that is neither too heavy, nor lacking substance. No matter what you believe, this film will make you wonder what if. What if lost things were found? What if the wrongfully removed were replaced? What if the ancient guardians of a cave of the dead had never lost their toy? What if we didn't so easily dismiss the old gods? We don't believe in silly curses and old world superstitions, but Daniel's story eats away at the foundation of those (non) beliefs. But for the talk of curses and premature endings, we're left with a profound feeling of admiration of a life well lived. This film was always about life, and by the end I can't help but think that the documentary has a life of its own. Rarely do people get to tell the story of their life so completely. Here, Daniel and his family get to tell his story as perfectly as can be told. Daniel has left me with lingering feelings. The emotions of his life's work are complex, but by the end of it I am certain of one thing: I will not feel sorry for Daniel."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),Positively Heartbreaking,"Considering the searing nature of this troubling documentary, I feel somewhat uneasy in recommending it as must-see viewing. Nevertheless, this is one of those films that has to be seen in order for the truth behind its story to be fully realized. When Ukrainian journalist-writer-director Mstyslav Chernov and two colleagues chronicled the first days of the nation's brutal conflict with Russia, they probably had no idea what they were in for. Working from the Black Sea port city of Mariupol, they captured devastating footage of the relentless Russian attacks, particularly the enemy's ruthless assaults on civilian targets, despite assurances to the contrary. The Russians were simultaneously determined to destroy the Ukrainian communications infrastructure to prevent word of the atrocities from getting out to the wider world, seriously hindering the work of Chernov and company as the only international journalists still in the war-torn country at the time. As the city was systematically being destroyed, the international community had little knowledge of what was transpiring in Mariupol beyond Russian President Vladimir Putin's skewed propaganda claims. But, when images of the warfront finally made their way out of Ukraine, the world got an entirely new perspective on the carnage unfolding there, despite the Russians' astoundingly incredulous claims that everything that had been photographed was staged, not unlike what one would find on a movie set. Such reporting opened the eyes of the world, first in media coverage at the time and now in this film, a joint production of the Associated Press and the PBS documentary series Frontline. This gripping release holds nothing back, making it an exceedingly difficult watch for virtually everyone, including those with thick skins who ordinarily might not be affected by such graphic imagery. However, it honestly reveals what the Ukrainians were up against in this horrific siege, putting the war crimes of the aggressors on display for all to see. In addition, this offering reinforces the importance of the work of intrepid journalists under the most trying of conditions, particularly where those wreaking havoc are desperate to keep the facts from reaching the light of day. This highly acclaimed film - a recipient of ample awards season buzz and honors - may be difficult to sit through, but discovering the truth is often a challenging process, and both Ukraine and the world should be grateful that there are those out there who are willing to put themselves on the line to see that through, no matter how treacherous or daunting circumstances may be."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),witness,"It's the 2022 Battle of Mariupol. On February 24, Russia invades Ukraine. This is a recounting with news reports and very much the title. At the outset of war, journalist-filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov and a crew scrambled to Mariupol with the expectation that it would be one of the main targets for the Russians. It is the largest city on the land corridor between Russian occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea. This is a tough watch. I'm not even sure that it's a must-watch. I do know that it is a must-film. A lot of important documentaries are time capsules of a moment and place. This is a lot more important than that. It is a witness to history and it could be one of the few video witnesses to survive the invasion."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),Hard to watch but a necessity,"War is ugly, but few things can prepare you for the things you see in this documentary. As a father of 2 young children I couldn't hold back constant tears throughout. Death is everywhere. Innocent people caught in the middle of something they never asked. Innocent children playing soccer getting their legs blown off by Russian shelling. A 4 year old boy crying in from of the camera saying he doesn't want to die. Doctors trying to bring back to life a 5 year old girl. And failing. A young couple not believing that the doctors couldn't save their 18 month boy. So hard to watch. But I watched, as should you. To see evil, understand it and not let it win."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),Heartbreaking...if you are Ukrainian,"I am Ukrainian but i was lucky enough to flee after one week of shelling around Kyiv. I wantad to see this movie for many months but i just could not and and one day i was just ready to do it. Its like i have accumulated the grief and one day I was ready to let it go. This movie is so true in its horror. Too true to be true. So real sometimes it feels surreal... I cried like a wild animal, couldnt hold it in. Its like something I as a Ukrainian been hiding down inside of me for these two years and this movie just let it all out. Its like i live, function, laugh, but behind the curtain i am dead like all these people in me beloved Ukraine."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),"Please, Please, WATCH THIS!","This is a brilliant, moving, audacious documentary from an extremely talented videographer and team, and deserves at least an Emmy and, even more preferably, an Oscar, but awards are not enough for this exceptional work. This is a rare, you-are-there experience, in which you are immersed in the Russian takeover of a city in the Ukraine, and where you feel every emotion that these poor beseighed people feel. The documentary starts on the week of March in which the Russian oligarch Putin (not the President, which would mean that he was elected) announces to the people of Ukraine that he is about to invade the country, and within moments, actually does launch a full-scale invasion, and we watch it happen almost moment by moment. Bombs fall on Soviet-style apartment complexes at a rate of hundreds a day, and the entire landscape soon begins to resemble the aftermath of Hiroshima. But what is most dynamic is the actual impact on the people themselves, many of whom do not know who is bombing them. Astounding. Watching children, pregnant moms, and hospital workers taking the worst beating of all is utterly depressing, but, like all medicine, needs to be taken and swallowed whole. Overall, this documentary is one of the most heart-wrenching, devastating, tear-jerking experiences ever. You owe it to yourself to see this to get the full effect, since words can never describe how much of an impact it will have on you. It is a shame that it would only be available on PBS, since that will alienate at least 95% of the population that needs to watch it, but if there is even a smidgen of justice left in the world, the few who see it will tell everyone they know, and hopefully, something will come from it. Thanks to the brave filmmakers who told this shocking story."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),Brutal Reality - as it was when the russians invade Mariupol,"I watched this movie in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, in September 2023. This cinema theatre was very nice, and I enjoyed the movie (documentary movie)
What stroke me in ""20 Days in Mariupol"" is that you really feel the level of violence that happened in the town. A town almost fully destroyed by the russians. It shows the reality of everyday life, how people had to survive, to hide, to protect themselves. I talked in August 2023 with a Ukrainian refugee in France, who came from Mariupol (so it was before watching the movie) and she told me several shocking things, but true:
""Sometimes, when I was in a shelter during the bombings, I dreamed I wanted to die""
and ""I was learning French in the corridors during the night and people thought I was crazy""
The whole world has still not understand that this war is a war that we thought could not exist anymore: a war to erase a whole country. To erase the largest european country (given the fact russia is geographically in Europe and in Asia) and Ukraine only in Europe. As a conclusion, I highly recommend this documentary. War in 2022 in Europe. Dark days but hope and Ukraine will always live."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),A terrorist and expansionist state that threatens anyone.,"A documentary that must be seen. It is the reality of the war, that is currently taking place and that cannot leave indifferent those who care about what is happening. In the first days of the war, I went to the Siret customs with my cousin from Suceava . We wanted to see if we could help the refugees, who were fleeing the war and entering Romania. And yes, we helped, but I won't go into the details. What I could see then, made me feel a lot of hatred towards the Russians. Women and children who were fleeing their country, being threatened by the ambitions of a state, that does not accept the democratic developments in neighbouring countries. The 20 days of filming in Mariupol show only a small part of the crimes and destruction in Ukraine, which the Russian army has done. The film came out late, a year and a half after the events presented, but it is an outstanding achievement, through which the whole world can see what the harshness of war means. I believe that NATO made a big mistake by not getting involved in the defense of Ukraine's territory, by establishing a no-fly zone, as Ukraine requested at the start of the Russian invasion. And now, no one can predict how and when this ongoing conflict will end."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),"A great reminder of what's going on in Ukraine, must see","This documentary is about as real as it gets. The film is pieced together from footage shot in Mariupol during February and March 2022. You might have already seen snippets, especially from the maternity hospital, but this takes you day by day and includes some less common materials. I won't get into the usual critiques of quality or story flow. That would be idiotic. They captured what they could in the midst of war, when everything including electricity for their cameras was at scarce. It surprises me that some reviewers are complaining, as if this were some Hollywood production in the making for five years. Jesus. I recommend watching it. The war is ongoing, and it won't just disappear because we're tired of it. It serves as a powerful reminder to the world about what's happening in Ukraine every day."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),"Memorable, yet more like a collection of footage than a documentary","Very rarely feels this hard to rate a movie. Yes, it has scenes you will remember for weeks, maybe for ever. Yes, it gives the viewer a strong impression about how war actually feels for a civilian (or a journalist). On the other hand, it is very hard to rate the production as a movie / documentary. You don't get too much context, you see and hear mostly things that you'd expect to see browsing a collection of footages. The main feature of the production is some kind of recklessness: the makers spent 20 days risking their lives for getting any coverage out from the city, and also, were not shy to show us shocking images about people who, it seems, were never asked (couldn't be asked) wheteher they find it OK to be on film (some even protest, but end up on the screen anyway). So, at the end, it is a philosophical question. If you believe the perfect documentary is something that makes you feel you were part of the experience it is about, 20 Days in Mariupol is perfect. If you seek some kind of cinematic production, you yill be one of those people, who will feel it almost unwatchable (and not just for ethical reasons)."
20 Days in Mariupol (2023),20 days in mariupol,"The footage shown in documentary is exceptional and very rare to see in war circumstances. This is the main reason why it's doing great with awards and festival. It shows lot of footage of maternity hospitals of people injured and also dead of all ages for at least half of the documentary. Some of it admired , however I still came away feeling disappointed from couple of things. 1. I didn't really feel the collection of footage was really suitable for a documentary story. Over the time span of the documentary not a lot happens, as it's all based in hospitals. All this footage was really meant for a special news programme on BBC or channel 4 for example. 2. I felt the trailer was misleading inciting it's about the oppression of Ukrainian people under Russian control and Ukrainians trying to escape. Which it doesn't show much. 20 days in Mariupol hospital would of been accurate name. 3. The director interviewing the civilians, had a pretty poor skill level in asking questions. He asked pretty basic dumb questions and civilian's kind of looking at him going really??? He went in hard and strong without thinking how can I soften these questions? It's Ashame because I really went in with high hopes and was itching to see this documentary for months. If you want to really exciting story documentary watch 'Cartel land' based on Mexican cartels. Now that's interesting...."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Very touching documentary,"A very touching documentary that makes you respect stuntmen a whole lot more. You never think about how many stuntmen actually do all the dangerous stuff you see in screen in this day of cig animations. The amount of skill, training and effort that takes to get this level of fitness and competence. Imagine being an actor earning millions, and stuntmen that risk their lives to make said actors look cool and earn all those millions of dollars, make such a little cut of all of it. They are very under-appreciated and I wonder what we could do to improve their standards of reward. Stuntmen are awesome."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),A moving and insightful new addition to the Harry Potter universe,"Since it's first arrival onto cinema screens all the way back in 2001 (a cinematic event that reminds me how old I am now!), the wizarding world of Harry Potter has provided fans with a plethora of memorable on screen and off screen moments with the property and characters still just as popular today as they ever were. With a recent Harry Potter videogame, a much-liked reunion special that reunited members of the films as they celebrated the first films 20th anniversary and HBO's announcement that they are hard at work on a new series based off the original books, the amount of new and old Harry Potter stories coming our way shows no signs of slowing down with this years intimate and touching documentary David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived another important part of the Potter story. A true life tale that has not been one prevalent in the public realm, documentary filmmaker Dan Hartley and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe shine a light on the story of stuntman and Radcliffe stunt double David Holmes, an energetic performer whose life was changed forever on a fateful day of the Harry Potter film set when a stunt he was practising went very wrong, causing a spinal injury to Holmes that saw him forever bound to a wheelchair with no chance of regaining use of his legs or lower body. Providing us with an insightful look into both the world behind the scenes of the Harry Potter films, Holmes friendship with Radcliffe and other stars of the movies and then Holmes life as he comes to terms with his new world and a constant battle to remain positive in the face of adversity, Hartley's film may not do anything outstanding in a delivery sense or production sense but Holmes story is an undeniably effective one that is touching, uplifting and important. Showing just how much the Harry Potter film world has meant to not only viewers but those a part of it over the better part of more than a decade, The Boy Who Lived not only acts as a showpiece for Holmes's inspiring journey in the face of constant trials and tribulations but a testament to the special nature of the films themselves and what they did for those who helped to bring it too life and the camaraderie and family like bond between many involved in the productions is evident throughout this doco. A documentary that is likely to be an important piece of the overall Harry Potter puzzle in the film universe fandom sense and one that will engage those rare few who care little for J. K Rowling's creation but have interest in the exploration of the human condition, The Boy Who Lived is a noteworthy small-scale film with a big heart, deserving to be seen by a wide-ranging audience. Final Say - Proving that the stories from the wider universe of Harry Potter both imaginary and real show no signs of running out, David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived is an effective documentary that shows a genuine care for its subject matter and the world he was an important part of bringing to life. 3 1/2 charity cricket matches out of 5 Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Heartbreaking and heartwarming,"I created an IMDB account just to review this at 10 stars. It was heart breaking and heart warming all at the same time. I am really glad I decided to watch this today as it's worth anyone's time. David's story and attitude are beyond admirable and inspiring. He reminds you of what is important in life and he inspires you to keep things in perspective and be a better person, all through his beaming personality, abundant kindness and acceptance of an actual living nightmare situation and through his continued drive, passion and motivation for life, friends, family and even the activities he loves but can no longer participate in himself. Definitely leaves you sitting in awe and a lot of feelings when the credits roll."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Wow!,"It hit me harder than I expected. I don't really get tearfull but bloody hell, tears in my eyes for a good part of this. What a guy David is, plus all his mates are such a nice bunch of lads. As always Dan Radcliffe comes across a really nice bloke. I would recommend this, although it's not necessarily an easy watch, but definitely worth it it, it makes you think about how fragile the human body is and a neck injury is just a terrible thing to happen, and I tell you what, a lot of people wouldn't have coped with it as well as Dave did, so there is a lot to be admired from him. Again like I said it hit me quite hard."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Well Produced,"A fascinating dive into the tragedy that happened to David Holmes. The documentary is well-produced and packed with interesting information. It's also full of hope and optimism, especially from David. The story is especially sad when you look at Greg and others on the set. The fact that they carried on, is a feat in itself. What Marc and Tolga have been able to do after the completion of the films is incredibly admirable. Seeing the support of everyone in the Harry Potter cast, especially those like Tom Felton and the Weasleys, is something to marvel at. Well worth the watch, even with the 20+ F-bombs."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Inspirational,"Possibly one of the most humbling things I've ever watched in my life. As somebody who lives with pain this really is humbling, this gentleman is an inspiration to everyone. I think this should be made compulsory for all kids to watch because it just shows that attitude is everything. David Holmes is an inspiration! Possibly one of the most humbling things I've ever watched in my life. As somebody who lives with pain this really is humbling, this gentleman is an inspiration to everyone. I think this should be made compulsory for all kids to watch because it just shows that attitude is everything. David Holmes is an inspiration!"
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),An extraordinary human,"""David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived"" is a poignant coming-of-age documentary about the extraordinary friendship between Daniel Radcliffe and his stunt double, David Holmes. The film takes a heart-wrenching turn as it explores how their bond endures a life-altering accident, providing an intimate glimpse into the challenges faced by Holmes. As the narrative unfolds, we have a chance to witness the emotional impact of this incident on both individuals, and the documentary skillfully weaves together a tale that will break your heart in a million pieces. For those who, like I, cherished the Harry Potter books and felt a certain nostalgia for the series, ""The Boy Who Lived"" offers a unique perspective. In its exploration of personal trials and friendship, ""David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived"" stands as a testament to the power of human connection and the resilience of the human spirit."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),What an amazing man,Honestly as a massive Harry Potter fan I never knew about David Holmes. What an amazing human to have such a great look on life with what happened. To do what you love every day being so active then to not be able to walk I can only imagine how hard that must be. Your an inspiration to anyone in your situation. I always wondered why Daniel Radcliffe wanted to distance himself from Harry Potter once the films were over and now I can imagine why it must of been hard with what happened. What a lovely friend to David and to stick by him through all the hard times seeing him like he is now must be so hard. Such a lovely documentary which I will remember for a long time.
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),Very touching,"I loved that we got the chance to see a part of the films that we've never seen before, even though it is not a happy part at all. This was a very emotional documentary for me, as I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. It was hard not to share a tear on the entire story. Daniel Radcliff is a great human being and it shows the compassion and empathy he has for everyone. He stayed so humble even after all the fame he got. David Holmes has a great strong spirit, even at a young age he was so inspiring and always had a positive attitude towards everything in his life. This documentary inspired me so much. I hope these two ""boys"" have the best life they can have."
David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (2023),some people just...,"Are nt born under a lucky star, a simple fact that i the grumpy old man also made a testimony trip to the broke-back mountain, though lucky enough to not to break the telephone cord that relays signals from A-B, so i might live under a rare lucky doublestar system that kept me away from T2-paralysis for the rest of my life...so david i can agree that the hell of pain of spinal damage is excruciating, a spell that you rather want to throw to people you hate most in life. Also remember that anyhow you got your injuries, that doesnt mean that you should let yourself be eaten up by the pain it causes, cause pain aint the holy grail of mending up. So as one radio D. J once said, '' just eat it , just beat it'', that has given me some durable bonus years after the ''cataclysmic'' events of mine. I'm a medical nurse by profession, and ive seen a lot of rehab work that has gone bad due to antimedicine oaths, therefore give yourself a chance along with your medical staff, it might change your already reduced options of life... a bittersweet story about the stunt double who had a ''hag-shot''(hekseskudd in my language) in his neck, and just another reminder how frail a human life may be."
Filling in the Blanks (2023),Absolutely Powerful and Interesting Documentary,"Jon Baime does an amazing job with this documentary about his journey of self-discovery due to his father's off-hand comment leading him to have a DNA test secretly. His ability to tell this story has you on the edge of your seat, fully engrossed. I felt like I was involved, part of the family, and I wanted to know more. It is an interesting insight into the world of popular DNA tests and what the results might lead to. You go into it thinking you want to know more about your ancestry but end up
finding out that nothing has been what it seemed and the family has had a secret you were not privy to. I highly recommend this documentary."
Filling in the Blanks (2023),"Very surprising, well told story","I wasn't sure I really wanted to watch this due to the immediate thought this was being thrown here due to the Israel conflict - a hightlight on some Jewish story. But I was wrong. It is a well written, well told story of one families experience with sperm donation and how it affects ensuing lives - personal feelings of angst and uncertainty. It was also set in a time I'm very familiar with and can definitely identify with the writer/narrator, Jon, all the facts surrounding early sperm donation and the stigma for a variety of reasons. This was a well done, firsthand account documentary that left ""no stone unturned"". It held my attention because the story and the ""players"" ARE REAL, they are human and a family and of course, most of us can identify with that. Very pleased I saw it; answered a whole lot of questions; gave me better insight to those I know going through life...Wondering."
Filling in the Blanks (2023),Incredible Discovery Journey,"I was immediately captivated by the trailer and therefore wanted to watch the whole documentary. The story brings historical perspective into what is now quite common place - the idea of a donor parent. DNA testing has opened so many doors for so many people. The story is told from a surprising, to me, perspective. The mystery that Jon lived with for over 50 years. His quest to solve the mystery and then to share it with others is a gift. Everyone will relate to some part of the story. The story is told with humor and sensitivity and understanding. I truly loved the way it was all combined to tell his version as well as sharing others."
Filling in the Blanks (2023),An Unexpected DNA Odyssey,"""Filling in the Blanks"": Unveiling Paternal Identities in a Modern Tale
""Filling In the Blanks"" is a poignant and thought-provoking documentary that delves deep into the lives of middle-aged individuals who discover the truth about their biological fathers through proprietary DNA analysis. Directed with finesse and sensitivity, the film offers a revelatory exploration of identity, family dynamics, and the emotional rollercoaster that accompanies such unexpected revelations. The film's central character, a middle-aged man grappling with the shock of discovering his true biological heritage, becomes the audience's guide through this complex journey of self-discovery. Through direct interviews, viewers are granted intimate access to the raw emotions of not only the protagonist but also his newfound brothers and sisters who share the same extraordinary situation. The documentary expertly captures their diverse range of reactions, highlighting that there is no one-size-fits-all response to such life-altering news. One of the most compelling aspects of the documentary is its exploration of the varying emotional landscapes of the siblings. Some are genuinely surprised, while others experience a profound sense of relief, shedding the unwanted baggage of their non-biological fathers. Amidst these disparate reactions, one common thread emerges - the unwavering love and dedication of their mothers, regardless of the paternal complexities. This underscores the powerful and enduring bonds that tie families together, transcending the boundaries of biology. As the narrative unfolds, the film deftly navigates the multifaceted layers of the human experience. It shines a spotlight on the societal shifts and attitudes of the past, specifically addressing the reluctant acceptance of artificial insemination during the 1960s. This contextual backstory adds depth to the broader discussion on identity and challenges our perceptions of family structures. The filmmakers are careful to present a balanced portrayal, allowing the audience to ponder the complexities and ethical considerations surrounding artificial insemination. An engaging and heartwarming subplot centers around the siblings' journey to connect with their biological father. The documentary captures their excitement and trepidation as they embark on this unique quest for self-discovery. The genuine warmth and openness of the biological father as he welcomes his newfound children into his life provide a touching counterpoint to the initial shock of the revelations. His willingness to share his medical history and personal experiences helps foster a sense of closure and understanding for the siblings, who yearned for a connection that had been concealed from them for so long. ""Filling in the Blanks"" excels in its ability to provoke introspection and dialogue on sensitive subjects. It raises important questions about the timing and necessity of disclosing the truth in cases of artificial insemination, highlighting the evolving perspectives on transparency and the potential impact on individual well-being. The documentary serves as a catalyst for conversations surrounding family secrets, the evolving nature of family structures, and the significance of genetic ties. In conclusion, ""Filling in the Blanks"" is a captivating documentary that masterfully captures the complexities of identity, family, and the profound impact of newfound revelations. With its insightful storytelling and candid interviews, the film prompts viewers to reflect on their own perceptions of family and the power of genetic connections. By shedding light on the deeply personal experiences of the characters, the documentary succeeds in its mission to illuminate the intricate tapestry of human relationships and the transformative power of truth."
Filling in the Blanks (2023),Must see if you are into DNA testing,"I am surprised I am the first one rating this very well done documentary. This movie is a must see to any one who has done DNA testing and found surprises once the results comes back. While this documentary focus exclusively about being conceived through a sperm donor, the emotional road each person travels once he/she finds out the truth, is not much different than finding out one is adopted, or that one of your parents had an affair. I do believe that for all those people that are experiencing DNA surprises, this documentary will help you understand, forgive, reconcile. At time Jon Baime sense of humor reminded me of Seinfeld. He keeps the documentary light and smoothly paced. I loved the cake message, the ending in the wall, and the gratitude shown. I find it refreshing that someone had the courage and goodwill to share his story. Kudos to the Blaine brothers for helping Jon making this documentary."
The Mission (2023),"Listen When Someone Says ""NO!""","The problem with missionary religious groups is that they are raised in a belief system of absolutes. Pushing a fantasy on new generations that one ""must"" convert the globe to their way of thinking never takes into account the opinion of those they're trying to convert. I don't come away from watching this documentary thinking of John Chau as a sympathetic figure in any way, shape or form. He is just another statistic in a long and - unfortunately - unbroken chain of the imperially arrogant devout who feels that their message is the only one worth heeding. A truly elevated and civilized human being doesn't think that way."
The Mission (2023),Um. Okay,"It's really a story that we all know about. But the real question is how it's told. The storytelling, for me, was pretty average. I like the live-action bit, but it did not blow my mind for sure. I wish the interviews had more depth. I like that they tried to humanise Chau - a brilliant but dumb kid who wants to ""save"" the world from Hell and pave the way for Jesus' return. However, his dad's mournful letter cannot be the sole reason for me to empathise with Chau. I wish the filmmakers tried digging deeper into his life. Also, how can you give TN Pandit such little screen time? And how can you miss the incredible Madhumala Chattopadhyay in this documentary that revolves around North Sentinel? Wish it was extensively researched and showed the Indian perspective."
The Mission (2023),Horribly Boring AND SLOW Documentary,"Years ago I aptly proclaimed that I was/am, and aptly gave myself the title of a, 'Documentary Nerd.' I honestly cannot think of a documentary that I've absolutely hated, nor have I ever not finished a documentary in its entirety...until this one! And my thoughts, feelings, rating, and review of this documentary have absolutely nothing to do with any religious, nor societal/sociological ""right or wrong"" points of view. They are, and it is, just what it is: This documentary was horribly boring and slow! Painfully so! I've sat in college trigonometry based physics lectures (as a NON-SCIENCE major!) after working a 12.5 hour overnight/night shift that held my attention more than this documentary (and that is saying A LOT!). Dull! Dry! Boring! And the information that was presented in it was so haphazardly thrown together and strewn about it was unbelievable! Adding to that, the director of the documentary couldn't seem to decide just what direction he wanted to go with this documentary, the underlying feeling that he was trying to achieve (ie. Touchy feely, or factually based). I sought high and low for this documentary after learning about it, hoping that it just happened to be including on one of my many streaming subscriptions and I was so excited when I found it on one of them that I instantly started watching it (or trying to watch it rather). Only to be horribly dismayed at how such an interesting story with so, so, so much documentary, and even feature film, potential was handled with such callous ineptitude and thus was subsequently destroyed."
The Mission (2023),"Similar to ""Savior Complex"" (but not nearly as good)","As ""The Mission"" (2023 release; 103 min) opens, we are introduced to John Chau, an evangelican Christian who is hellbent on doing missionary, the further away and more isolated, the better. Through something called ""Unreached People"", he sets his sights on the 200 or so resident on the North Sentinel Island, one of the most isolated spots on earth (in the Bay of Bengal)... Couple of comments: this is the second documentary from co-directors (and real life husband and wife) Jesse Moss and Amanda McBain (""Boys State""). Here they reassess the life and times of John Chau, the evangelican Christian whose mission went horribly wrong. Of course it raises the issue of the assumed superiority by (almost always white) people who are determined to show the rest of the world how it's done and how to live a proper and meaningful life. The thought that maybe, just maybe, this is just insanely arrogant, if not worse, doesn't even enter their universe. All of these themes were also examined in another documentary from earlier this year called ""Savior Complex"", and frankly better than in ""The Mission"". (As a complete aside, please do not confuse this documentary with the 1986 movie of the same name starring Robert de Niro. They are completely unrelated projects.) ""The Mission"" premiered at the Telluride film festival some months back and it is now streaming on Hulu. If you are curious about the moral pros and cons of religious missionary work by white people across the globe, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
The Mission (2023),Hilarious study in hubris.,"Damn, this is mind blowing. Violating the human rights of the ""sentinelese"" by not introducing them to jesus? Right, whilst the missionary's hawking product tie-ins on their social media - I'm sure that's what jesus had in mind when throwing the money lenders out the temple. In fact, I think that part of jesus' life was sponsored by Mountain Dew. Nevermind the Human Right of the Sentinese to have hidden cameras placed on their island so the missionary could study them or potentially have illness/disease introduced to them that they have no immunity to. I remember 9/11 and the New York lady that was circulated in the media ""why do they hate us""? It's up to you to decide, but personally I found no redeeming features in any of the social group of the missionary, who I could best desribe as well-intentioned, but ultimately dangerous proto-fascists ""for christ"". I've had the misfortune of being around evangelicals - if you're not one of them ""converting"" you seems to be how they measure their own worth - not living as christ, but bullying, cajoling, threatening, bribing - all whilst failing to observe the beam in their own eyes. Nothing of value was lost here other than the time the Sentinelese took to dispose of this ""person"" that they no doubt could have spent not being disturbed."
The Mission (2023),Is It Altruism or Arrogance?,"Is religious missionary work an act of altruism or arrogance? Does it represent a quest for the fulfillment of one's spiritual potential or a euphemistic cover for an inflated sociopathic ego? And, in either case, is it even possible to distinguish the two? Those are legitimate questions in the case of 26-year-old fundamentalist Christian missionary John Chau, who disappeared and was presumed dead in 2018 while attempting to spread the word of Jesus to the reclusive indigenous residents of North Sentinel Island, an Indian protectorate in the Bay of Bengal. The locale, one of the world's most difficult destinations to reach and one that's strictly off limits to outsiders, is home to an obscure, little-known tribe with a reputation for being mistrusting of and unwelcoming to strangers. Yet Chau was convinced that it was his destiny to convert them to Christianity no matter what, even at the cost of his life, a concern that worried his family, friends and seasoned missionaries who had attempted comparable initiatives with native people in other parts of the world. It was an effort that raised questions about Chau's motivations: Was he a committed religious zealot who truly wanted to spread the word of Christ, or was he suffering from a maniacal Messiah Complex hell-bent on testing the limits of his courage, hubris and personal capabilities? Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss seek to answer these and other thorny questions about this enigmatic individual whose real intents may never really be known, leaving lingering doubts and pain about his mission in the minds of those who knew him. Thanks to unprecedented access to Chau's kindreds, as well as his recovered diaries, the filmmakers tell a captivating tale about his experience, along with thought-provoking ethical examinations about the nature and propriety of missionary work in connection with indigenous societies. Should it continue? Is it appropriate for Westerners and devout Christians to interfere in the spiritual lives of those who adhere to alternate viewpoints? Indeed, are these people genuinely in need of being ""fixed,"" regardless of the alleged nobility behind the intentions of those seeking to carry out these transformations? ""The Mission"" offers viewers a delicately balanced view of these notions, prompting even the most dedicated disciples of this work to step back and take a new look at what they and their peers are carrying out. It also presents an eye-opening discussion of this subject, encouraging us to ask ourselves, how much is too much when it comes to missionary work, regardless of the religion involved? And when is it appropriate to leave things as they are for those who already appear to be happy and contented in their lives and beliefs? There's a lot on the line in this Critics Choice Documentary Award nominee, and, in light of the nature of its story, that's something we must never lose sight of."
The Mission (2023),Glorification of hopeless act,"I started watching this documentary to see the glimpse of sentinal island. However i think what they are showing is just another fake island. This is pure waste of 1hr 40 mins. In the start of this documentary the character says "" is this the last fort of devil?"" why devil? It is untouched nature just let it be as is. Why do john wants to destroy it? This documentry (?) glorifies the foolish act of spreading christianity where it is not needed. Why do missionaries want to force their views on world? Why do this john character wanted to enforce his beliefs on people who are kept protected from world? He endangered them by visiting that place. I do not understand the purpose of this documentary. It looks like director wanted to showcase how that fool was having a strong faith and what he did was to spread his beliefs (unncessarily on others)"
The Mission (2023),Not really a documentary,"This story is wildly sad and unfortunately told with a bias towards the individual involved, John. I'm sure many will see this as an inspiration to repeat this tragic behavior in the name of God. I have but one question for the Christian community as a whole. Assuming you believe God is all powerful, all knowing and all mighty. Why does God need you to do God's work? If God is all powerful, then God can speak to any human God wishes to speak with and provide guidance without the help of other humans. The fact that there are people so unbelievably arrogant that think a book written by men is the actual work of and word of God it's simply mind boggling. To believe you are needed means God it's not capable thus not a God is just as mind boggling. This poor soul died due to human arrogance and this story only promotes it without balance."
The Mission (2023),Moronic behaviour,"Why on earth do people feel the need to force their views and opinions on others? Especially ones that live in the middle of nowhere and have made it clear they do not want to be contacted? I actually think this makes religious nutters look even worse than I thought possible. I've got a great idea why don't I go and force my opinions and views on other people that aren't interested!? There in lies the problem with the world and this piece of garbage. The movie romanticised him way too much in the beginning and I actually think he got what he deserved...I know that may sound harsh, but I think the moral of the story is leave people to live in peace and mind you own business."
The Mission (2023),Interesting and provided more context about why he did it,"Let me start by saying I'm not religious whatsoever so that's not why my rating is higher than others. When I first heard of this story I was just perplexed of course as to why he would do what he did... figured he was just naive and did it all on a whim. The film is very detailed showing WHAT exactly lead him to not only go to the island, but to keep pushing as much as he did: his upbringing, high school/ college mentors, personality and so on. Not saying it was smart to do, just interesting to know why. Was not a fan of the animated portions. Lastly as someone who thinks the North Sentinel island is fascinating along with other similar islands/ tribes left in the world, this was cool to watch. I didn't get the ""glorifying his actions"" vibe at all, even the one ex- missionary guy said how dumb he was."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),"Embarrassing, boring and not an endearing character in sight","Too slow to be that boring. It's basically an episode of ""Days of our lives"" Aussie bush version. Maybe this is a typical small Aussie bush town but damn did they have to live up to all out crappy stereotypes?! How embarrassing
The alcoholism is at the centre. They'd have to all be drunk driving every day. Disgusting. The cussing like it's normal. Classy. Living in a town with so few people is asking for trouble. Not only are troubled people attracted to towns in the middle of nowhere but familiarity breeds contempt and it certainly did here. U won't like these ""characters"". Xxx.xxxxxxzzzzzz."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),How bizarre,"Ok, weird anomaly watching ""Last stop in Larrimah"", after watching ""Pain Hustlers"", ""Transparent"" inadvertently!!. I'm a true blue Aussie and obviously now a Jay Duplass fan without knowing it. I'd heard the podcast and the visual will hope help find the culprit. Worth the watch! Pure coincidence in hitting the button to watch this informative documentary but insightful to the going's of the outback especially where a missing person/murder has occurred (think Pete Falconio) for us regional mob or the city slickers and I guess the rest of the world. Maybe they'll keep us updated on news as it comes, but won't hold my breath!!!!"
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),Exceptionally well researched!,RIP Paddy Moriarty. I literally signed on just to give a review for a greatly portrayed Aussie doco/investigation. Thanks for giving each town player a voice too. Was it Richard who said there's two sides of a story and the truth is somewhere in between? Or something to that effect. You guys really captured the heart of Larrimah. I cried at the ending. Peter Allen gets me every time. Each new piece of evidence has you on the edge of your seat secretly convicting the next person who is spoken about poorly by their 10 person town neighbour. I love that Larrimah's legacy lives on in the young new blood that is now running in its veins! I hope Larrimah's new baby gets to write a whole new story for the town! I was going to stop there but I need 600 words so good luck to the crocodile as well. Maybe there will be some little baby reptiles kicking around town soon. Perhaps someone will invest in reviving the tourist park. What else? Part 3? Ok. I'm still going apparently. I LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. I HOPE WE FIND PADDY AND HIS DOG. PLEASE MAKE YOUR NEXT INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE WIEAMBILLA KILLINGS!
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),"This is such a quirky, but interesting documentary.","Larrimah is an Australian town with only ten residents, until recently it has eleven, only Paddy was killed, The Police believed that Paddy's adversary killed him, and the motive was pies... What a fascinating story this is, not the usual documentary I opt for on Netflix, but it's totally engaging. I loved the pacing, early on I didn't quite know which way it was heading, it all seemed sweet and lovely, with some very interesting and very open people, but as it develops, the scandals and open hatred comes seeping through. I honestly couldn't believe some of the revelations, wow, there was some real resentment, and in a town of eleven people, that was likely to cause problems. It's a little padded out in parts, but the interviews are so interesting, especially the lady from the pie shop. So many characters. What an incredible place, it really does look like a place that has once seen better days, but is somewhat off even that pace. Very entertaining. 7/10."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),Original and interesting,"Larrimah redefines 'small town'. Almost everyone is a murder suspect in this town with a population of 10 citizens, and almost everyone had an altercation or feud with Patrick Moriarty. It is a very interesting documentary. To see the once thriving Larrimah be run into the ground by its own residents was very sad. The clashes between the neighbours seems petty at first, but we soon learn that the tension run much deeper and darker than expected. I felt sympathy for Fran Hodgetts. I do not believe she was treated fairly by those interviewing her and the filmmakers, instead it looked like there was attempts to make her into a laughing stock purely based on the person she is. The things she said about Patrick in the past footage was edited and replayed to make her seem suspicious or the likely murderer - but on reflection, anyone who had a feud with someone would say similar tongue in cheek phrases such as 'What goes around comes around'. Nothing she said screamed 'Murderer' to me, and as we see at the end of the documentary, it is fairly obvious who the likely killer is. I expected the town to crumble as the documentary was coming to a close, however I was surprised at how pleased and emotional I was to see that there is new hope for Larrimah. Hopefully the new and old residents can learn from past mistakes and build a promising future together. I have every hope."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),Bad Day at Outback,"There's a-feuding and a-fussing and a-fighting in Netflix's documentary ""Last Stop Larrimah,"" population eleven, minus one, all in all, a homey expose of the simple pleasures in the land-down-under: beer, meat pies, the great outdoors, beer, man's best friend, and deep-rooted, festering, personal animosities. In a way, the outback is Australia's badlands, where life is close to the land until it's eventually underneath it. For some, like local eccentric, Paddy Moriarty, whose head meets with a hammer, maybe too soon. There's larceny in the heartland, so it seems, and intense loathing, bitterness, heaps of grudges and accusations, but worst of all, insanity where there ought to be sanctuary. The inhabitants of misery's reward, this narcoleptic watering hole, have forsaken modesty and a shirt, to air their petty grievances, with some reluctant remorse, over the course of five years. Wasted effort, it seems, for a lot of ornery Aussies, one transplanted Irishman, and a dog."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),"Rather Intriguing Fargo, Australia","This was quite a surprise and I found myself intrigued from beginning to end- a very quirky, frustrating, enigmatic tale of the murder of someone who may or may not have been a great Irish immigrant, may or may not have been a great neighbor, may or may not have been a pot-stirrer, and his dog (NO NOT THE DOG!!) neither of which deserved to be killed in cold blood for nothing in particular. The residents are a menagerie of characters- some of which feel quite slimy- amongst them Fran and Owen, of which seem to be painted in an unflattering light yet they do absolutely nothing to help themselves fight the portrayal. They're both quite vitriolic and full of blame for all their problems on anyone but themselves. Then there's Karen and.her husband, but she seems to like the camera more than her husband. The name definitely seems to fit, as she epitomizes it in virtually every way possible. So many people are castigated by the others, including a lot of whining, miserable miscreants who can't seem to find a way to keep a business afloat yet keep plenty busy with keeping the rumor mill running full steam, having no problem with tossing ridiculous accusations and nonsensical claims with absolutely no regard for the man who has been missing and presumed dead or those they happen to share a community with. All that being said, it's a seemingly lighthearted and somewhat cheeky true crime documentary but never loses sight of the fact that an innocent man lost his life and has never been heard from again. It's a rather interesting story told in a fascinating way that's a fresh new way, so be prepared for every budding artist to now put their spin on this and fill the void with some of the insipid work the genre has seen since Jimmy Hoffa went for a walk."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),The kind of mysteries Netflix should be involved with! [+68%],"I love stories about small towns. So, this one really intrigued me from the get-go. The piece begins with the (ten) inhabitants talking about their decision to move to Larrimah in the first place, and what they love about it. We then move to the mystery of a missing man and the filters of suspicion suddenly switch on. Frankly, the slow-burn reveals of the townsfolk surprised me one after the other. Not only do some hold major grudges against the rest, but they're also completely open about it. The aesthetics of the place (and its people) had my attention throughout. The pub with the crocodile, the pie shop, the bush, the stilt houses, the large open spaces, the dogs, the sunsets - there's something about the place that even a complete outsider like me can get drawn to. The interviews are spread out between all of the residents of the town, and everyone gets to voice their thoughts. The place, the story of the missing man, the people (their ongoing grudges and motives) - I feel this has everything needed for a neo-noir crime drama, at least on paper. It's predominantly Australian too - like, where else do you see folks candidly talk about murder while chugging beer, smoking, or laughing their butt off?"
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),Fargo in Aussie,"This was great. They way the story is told, will keep you guessing. Guessing which side you're on. They cinematography is really well excecuted and the line up of real life characters is unbeliveable. A gem for the true crime audiences out there. But it also tells the tale of humans- humans with too much time on their hands, living in the middle of nowhere, drinking the day away, just being. I kind of want to go visit the town now, that i feel like i know everybody there. Meet the colorful characters, have a beer, and talk about what REALLY happened that night Paddy went missing. Great, great documentary."
Last Stop Larrimah (2023),Land of plenty feuds,"If you love Fargo (the film), you'll probably enjoy this as a real life whodunnit, with a wealth of eccentric Fargo-like characters, each and every one of them far stranger than fiction. In a nutshell, this true story revolves around 11 people who are the sole inhabitants of a tiny villlage off the beaten track in northern Australië. Did I say 11? I mean 10. One of them has mysteriously disappeared, presumably murdered. You'd think with such a meagre population it wouldn't be too difficult to narrow down a suspect or two, right? Yeah, unless the potential murder victim had more than a few enemies among his ten-fold brethren. To further complicate matters, the remaining ten don't like (any of) each other much either, and that's me putting it very mildly. This 2 episode series is hard to compare with anything else, but I can say this: the individuals who tell the story - Larrimah's population, all of them potential suspects (and some cops from the nearest glimpse of civilization) - had me completely absorbed. There's lots to say about them, but it's hard to find the words, I assure you. And if you have yet to watch this, the less said the better."
Family Switch (2023),The situations are ridiculous with a lot of over-the-top acting moments.,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix offers a family-friendly comedy that also serves as a holiday-themed flick. The body-switching movie was directed by McG. Writing credits go to Chris Shafer, Victoria Strouse, Adam Sztykiel, and Paul Vicknair. The story is about a family who has a chance encounter with an astrological reader who mysteriously causes them to wake up to a full-body switch. Their next day is filled with important events for each one which complicates and entertains. THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Jennifer Garner and am always happy to see her in anything. I thought she was so fantastic in her fun TV series Alias. Did you ever see that? While the script isn't incredible, the fantastic class makes up for it. Check out the fan favorites: Ed Helms, Matthias Schweighofer, Rita Moreno, Fortune Feimster, Howie Mandel, Paul Scheer. The new, young actors I hadn't seen before are Emma Myers and Brady Noon. There is plenty of heart as the family learns to appreciate what each other is going through in their life. I love it when movies reference other movies. For example, Ed Helms' character says he's ""13 Going on 30"" which is an adorable body-swap movie that also stars Jennifer Garner. The movie was originally going to be called ""Family Leave."" It's actually not a bad name, although the current name is perfectly descriptive. You'll get some Christmas cheer with some fun songs. Keep watching during the final closing credits to watch some funny bloopers. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Wow, most of those high school students definitely didn't look like high school kids! The plot doesn't exactly break any new ground in this genre, except maybe the fact that an entire family swaps places. The situations are ridiculous with a lot of over-the-top acting moments. TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of farting
We see a dog urinate a lot
Close-up shot of a colonoscopy
Teen partying
Some profanity
Lots of bad behavior
Spitting
Adults & teens drink alcohol
Awkward kissing
School bullies. To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!"
Family Switch (2023),Underrated movie,Honestly I like this movie no one can tell me different. I seen body swap movies before. This movie is not as bad as people it is. I think Jennifer Garner is great. Ed helms is good as always. Brady noon has a bright future. Emma Myers really did stole the show for me. So I definitely recommend this movie. They have the best on screen chemistry I ever seen in a long time. Plus the baby and the dog switch places is a treat. Netflix may have hits and misses but for this movie is definitely a hit for me. So please ignore the haters and critics cause this movie deserves love. Also thank you so much for reading and please take care. Peace.
Family Switch (2023),Starts Off Good,"The movie has a cute concept, however the part that lost it for me was the switch with the baby and the dog is kind of stupid. The animation with the dog baby just is super fake looking and acting. Half the time the dog and the baby are completely forgotten about. The ""parents"" went to bed and no one put the baby to bed. If the dog and baby would have been left out of the movie I would have liked it better. Also the car scene with flying around the traffic and Jennifer Garner getting on the hood is super far fetched. I hate when movies start off good and then take it way way to far with stuff that you know is super fake could never happen."
Family Switch (2023),One of the funniest movies I have ever seen!,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen! I am still laughing. It has that 90s humor writing style that I really love. I had a great time with my family watching it. All the actors were good but Jennifer Garner was amazing she was so much into both of her characters, so funny and self-deprecating! The movie doesn't just make you laugh; it makes you feel good. It is a great film to watch with your whole family through the holiday season and it is also a comedy with a good message... I also added the movie to my funniest movie list in notion cause I am definitely gonna see it again. It has that ""home-alone"" vibe that sticks with you. I hope in the future they make Family Switch 2."
Family Switch (2023),Adults look too old and the kids are just boring,"Not sure what creators intentions were but Jennifer Garner who played the mom didn't age well, looked very wrinkly than the age who had a new born and why was she wearing dark red lipsticks all the time with pajama?! I saw her with so much makeup with wrinkles very old looking. It didn't suit her at all and made her look very cheap and odd looking. They should have casted much younger woman as she was 10-15 years older her actual role. She also looked like Gena David and wasn't an appealing look on her (cheap looking). The dad played by Ed Helms (a guy from the Office) looked really old and again he looked way older than should be for the role. Not sure why these pathetic Netflix people cast these actors and actresses who don't even have the proper look nor in the suitable age for the roles. Don't put someone 15-20 years older than the actual role and make them look like they actually are with cheap looking set designs. It makes the movie look and feel unprofessional and really fake. I had to stop the movie and couldn't watch the entire thing as it was too pathetic and decided to watch YouTube instead. They create better contents than all of you combined on Netflix. It is also no wonder it only took Netflix a few months to film this and a few months after to release it on Netflix where a proper film usually takes way longer and cast proper actors and actresses. I mean have you seen Jennifer Garner in real life? She looks really old without all the filters...why cast that kind of old looking woman here?? And why does Netflix categorize this as ""Hollywood"" movie? Let me tell you you Netflix ain't the Hollywood and any movie or series created by you guys are far from Hollywood productions. Just because putting together a few mediocre someone who was married to a big name actor or played in TV sitcoms doesn't make a great movie worthy to call Netflix ""Hollywood movies"". I found this to be such a joke. No Hollywood movie makes a movie in a few months and release it without proper editing or reviews. They don't have proper production designer and the entire movie felt pathetic and overdone. Don't waste your time. Not recommended."
Family Switch (2023),Just watch other Christmas movies,This movie is so low budget and is just unfunny it's a dumb movie that not a lot of people are gonna care about and that is a fact I can't stand it but if your kid's gonna watch it just put it on if it'll make them quiet it's dumb slapstick and Pyrocynical is gonna cover this video if he still does that someday other than that this movie is just stupid and it's a complete flop like every other Netflix family films a cringy low budget film that no one really likes acting is usually horrible and the storyline and storytelling is horrible and it personally isn't a family favorite film among anyone other than 4-9 year old kids.
Family Switch (2023),Awful. Jennifer Garner is no great actress,"This film was painful to watch. I didn't really have high expectations, thought it would be a fun no brainer kind of film. But no. The acting is so horrid, especially Jennifer Garner's, that I could barely get through it. Did she always talk with a baby voice? Aside from this being a predictable film (been done many times before), it's almost insulting to the viewer. One feels bad for Rita Moreno, a true legend. We're also supposed to believe they live in that big house in LA based on their jobs- completely unrealistic. The best part of the movie is the cameo from the French Bulldog. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
Family Switch (2023),Come on give me a break!,"No nay saying here I and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes it's not Citizen Kane but it's fun and thoughtful. The actors are entirely adquate in their performances and seemed to enjoy their work. We enjoyed the many references to other ""switch"" movies and it has a good redemption story where everyone has a. Winning endgame. In the cancel culture we live in it has redemptive qualities. It is humorous without being goofy and thoughtful and deep in character meaning without being sappy or maudlin. There is enough character development to make the story relateable. Kudos to the writers and all the staff and the actors with parts large or small for making ""art"" enjoyable. My daughter noticed that every character got to have a SPIT take."
Family Switch (2023),You will Laugh So hard and cry,"""Family Switch"" is a Dad Joke that is both corny and entertaining. It features a body-switching movie where a character assures everyone that it's a unique and original situation. The movie references other body-switching films, such as ""13 Going On 30"" with Jennifer Garner as the producer. The film has a sprightly direction from McG, an appealing cast, and a parade of all-star supporting characters, making it a fun and entertaining watch. In ""Family Switch,"" the Walker family faces stress due to losing touch with their teenagers. Architect mother Jess (Garner) and high school music teacher Bill (Ed Helms) are disappointed to learn their children are not excited to see them dress up like candy canes and dance to the Jackson 5. Their soccer-star daughter CC (Emma Myers) shares that they used to make family Christmas videos. The game features a family of teens, including Jess Walker (Garner), a workaholic architect, her husband Bill (Ed Helms), a frustrated musician and music teacher, CC (Emma Myers), a competitive soccer player, and her shy 16-year-old brother Wyatt (Good Boys' Brady Noon). One day, they encounter an astrological psychic, leading to a life-altering event where Jess, CC, Bill, Wyatt, Miles, and Pickles, the family dog, find themselves in each other's bodies. The situation is filled with humor, as writers Victoria Strouse and Adam Sztykiel milk every possible situation out of it. Director McG keeps the pace fast and furious, with Jess and Bill finding renewed youth and attraction at a teenage dance, CC and Wyatt learning about responsibility, and Pickles and Miles getting the big laughs. The game aims to show that it takes drastic action to truly understand the chasm between teens and their parents. The film, set during Christmastime, features a game cast including Garner and Helms, Myers and Noon, and a talented cast. Despite its festive appearance, the film is not a traditional Christmas movie, focusing on the understanding and appreciation of family members. Moreno delivers a strong performance, while the supporting cast, including Matthias Schweighofter, struggles with one-dimensional roles. The film is a pure family fun, with producers including Garner, McG, Lawrence Grey, Ben Everard, Nicole King Solaka, and Mary Viola. Body-swap comedies are a genre where adult actors channel their inner innocent kid and young actors channel their serious adult. Since the original ""Freaky Friday"" (1976), this genre has been marked by true Hollywood artistry, such as Tom Hanks' classic performance in ""Big"" and Jennifer Garner's lyrically funny bedlam in ""13 Going on 30."" However, since then, hundreds of Hollywood comedies have wallowed in a baseline joke of American middle-class behavior, repeating it like a sacred trope. The movies teach us that adults are overgrown children, creatures of impulse and appetite, arrested by their immersion in pop culture. On the other hand, kids move through the world with the verbal precocity and confident observational style of grown-ups, implying that they already are adults in kids' bodies. ""Family Switch"" is a double body-swap movie that reminisces about a fractured L. A. family during Christmastime. The Walkers, a mother and daughter, and their father and son, are forced to switch bodies by a magical gypsy fortune teller. The movie's comedy is weakened by the double cliché, as the characters' lives are revealed. The mother, Jess, tries to become the first female partner at her architecture firm, but finds herself in the body of her daughter, CC. The father, Bill, is a high-school music teacher who misses out on being a member of Maroon 5. He finds himself in the body of his brainiac son, Wyatt. The two kids now occupy the middle-aged faces and physiques of their secretly desperate parents. The movie's humor is largely reductive and undercuts the comedy. The film ""Bust a Move"" is a humanistic comedy that focuses on the struggles of a group of adults and kids who switch bodies. The actors are engaging, and the director, McG, stages the movie with a verve that would translate into something halfway delightful. However, the script, loosely based on Amy Krouse Rosenthal's best-selling children's book ""Bedtime for Mommy,"" is less a smoothly rounded plot than a cluttered, opportunistic heap of situations. The characters' bodies are not different enough, and the movie's humor is wrecked when they bust a move at a high-school party, which should be a joke. The film's success relies on the actors' engagement and the director's ability to stage the movie with a verve. The Walkers discover their family member is a better person than they thought, appreciate each other, and play Bruce Springsteen's ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" together. Despite everyone missing out on their dream, the movie's overly programmatic approach is overshadowed by its worst line. ""Family Switch"" has some amusement but is mostly a wishlist for a better movie. The film's worst line is ""Bein' your dad has been the rock 'n' roll adventure of a lifetime."""
Family Switch (2023),I swapped brains with a vegetable to watch this movie,"I thought this movie looked a bit lame but my wife wanted to watch it. I was wrong. It was TOTALLY lame, but she liked it. Not much more to say ... what, another 440 characters? Make that 414. No 406. Wait ... OK, there were a few laughs, mostly the dog-child swap scenes and the bloopers, gotta love bloopers, but this is derivative formula with lots of preaching and heart-warming messages about the importance of family and getting along. We got the usual cliche - adults back in high school, children faking it hilariously (not) in the workplace, and 69 characters to go - but I wouldn't bother unle."
Spirited (2022),Watching it over and over,"I had no idea what to expect with this movie and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. This has become one of my favorite Christmas movies, dare I say movies in general. Obviously I'm extremely biased because I love musicals and am a big Elf fan. If you like both of those things - this is probably the movie for you! We particularly enjoyed the meta humor (similar to Schmigadoon). The side characters were also so good. Will Ferrell, Ryan Reynolds and Octavia Spencer were all excellent AND sang well - surprise! The dance numbers were incredible AND hilarious. We even involuntarily teared up toward the end. All in all hilarious, goofy, well-acted, excellent dance numbers and catchy fun songs to listen to all day. Bravo all. Happy to have a new musical to love!"
Spirited (2022),Fun.,"Starts off great but slows down. Smart idea for a movie! Is this movie worth watching? Yes, during the holidays. How was the plot? Smart at the start but gets lame later on. Was the budget enough? Yes. Apple TV did it well. What is this movie saying about our world? Not sure. What is your emotional response to this movie? I was happy at times. What did this movie make me feel? Okay at times. What thoughts does this movie spark in me? Cookies. What themes are present in this movie? Xmas stuff. Why would someone want to watch this film? To get in the holiday mood. What does this movie have to say about the big story we are in? We are tools. What does it make me think about? Cookies again."
Spirited (2022),Great spin off of a classic but with the same message with a modern twist,"I love the movie; they have good, funny elements in it, and the musical elements give it a surprising twist. Not so boring. It's easy-made and cheap, but it shows you only need a little to make things good. The story is long but does take a lot of time even though the story does not need it. It's a very classic holiday movie type and American, of course. The acting could be better. I love the twist of a classic, but this one is just for a bit older age and is not a real family movie makes it the downfall of the movie as it should, or else you cannot really say it is a holiday movie. The sound is good."
Spirited (2022),We need more messages like this,"Ignore the naysayers for sure. Just give it a watch and don't read the reviews. I never look at reviews anyway, and here I am writing one haha. If it has a good, positive message, especially for kids, it's worth sharing. I was a little skeptical at first because it was a musical and I'm not heavy on them, but I had to give it a chance because well it's Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds is cool too. I love how they brought up the bullying aspect with the kids. Touching on that is so important these days because social media can be a nightmare for kids, especially with cyber bullying. It was done very creatively overall, pretty cool concepts all things considered."
Spirited (2022),'Good Afternoon!!',"Spirited is an amazing movie. Even though Elf is better, this is still a great movie with Will Ferell and Ryan Reynolds. The movie had great songs but the songs felt like they came out of nowhere. Also there was too many songs. This movie had about 15 songs. Even though this is a musical that is way too much. My favorite song though, was the one Ryan Reynolds was singing about Christmas trees. Also this movie is hilarious. It's super funny and it has two great comedic actors, Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferell. Still, after all that, this movie gets a 6.6? Good afternoon. Yes, good afternoon, one of my favorite lines in the movie. If you watch the full movie, and not just 5 minutes, you will know why. I would recommend this movie to you if you like Elf or if you like musicals, and or comedy, and and or holiday movies. In my mind, giving a modern twist to the classic Christmas story was a great idea. I also love the ending of the movie. It's just not what you would expect and it is very creative. In all, I give this a 8.4 out of 10."
Spirited (2022),Our new holiday tradition,"What's not to love? Will Ferrell is in his charming mode, funny, but tender and restrained. I knew Octavia Spencer could act, but who knew she could sing?! And I love Ryan Reynolds anyway, with his lovable smarminess that only he can pull off without the cringe, but here he is doing that while tap dancing!!! Heartstrings are tugged just enough to give you all the feels, but not so much that they gag you. They knew how to take sentimentality right to the line without crossing it - Reynolds has a lot to do with that. And the songs are REALLY GOOD - take that from a musical perfectionist! This is more than just a rehash of a Christmas Carol, it's tears and laughter, excellent dancing, and a good story, all wrapped in a beautiful package. And did I mention how good the songs are?! Watching this will be our new holiday tradition."
Spirited (2022),One of the best new Christmas films of recent years,"Spirited is an incredibly fun and enjoyable Christmas film that will most definitely get you in the Christmas spirit. Mostly this is because it combines the tried and tested Christmas Carol story (albeit a heavily re-imagined version), the comedy chops of Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds, and the feel good vibes of a musical. The plot does take a little while to find its feet, but once it does you will be fully hooked into the premise and will be sure to enjoy the ride. It's a really fun re-imagining of the story which has been done to death, so it does feel fresh and contains quite a few surprises. I think the songs are incredibly cheesy but they do work and the dance and musical sequences are all really well constructed and are thoroughly entertaining. And really what is there to say about the cast? Will Ferrell is one of the finest comedy actors working right now so he is flawless as expected. His back and forth with Ryan Reynolds is brilliant and the two of them are hilarious together. Top all this off with some lovely Christmas vibes and the result is a film that deserves to be considered a modern Christmas classic!"
Spirited (2022),Really quite awesome!,"I'm grateful I gave this movie a chance, as a fan of both Reynolds and Ferrell. There is an abundance of singing (in the best way). I enjoyed the storyline, an oldie with a creative twist. The acting was good and I thought the chemistry between Ryan and Will was ideal. This movie was really great, I am a fan of musicals and loved the storytelling of the songs. Spirited exceeded my expectations really - the humor is felt through out and I appreciated the modern day twist of a timeless Christmas classic. I was so impressed with the performances of all characters, the singing and dancing was exciting and I didn't find it to be corny or obnoxious like some reviewers. If you enjoy music and Ryan Reynolds + Will Ferrel's humor, you will love this movie. Happy Holidays!"
Spirited (2022),Not your classic Scrooge tale...,"From beginning to end, this show surpassed my expectations. Great Ferrell and Reynolds comedic delivery and wonderful dance and musical choreography. I was taken back by the 6.6/10 rating showing up here on IMDB and even worse on other websites. I originally rated it as an eight of ten, but I raised it because barely seven is not reflective of the degree of talent and effort that went into this production. Tracy Morgan's humor and style also add a spark to the character he voices. Octavia Spencer, always a favorite, really shines in her role. Great supporting cast and many performers really push the limits on this ""Spirited"" Christmas Carol tale! My opinion nonetheless, but I also really like musicals!"
Spirited (2022),I don't know,"I normally love a musical, especially a Christmas musical but I just wasn't feeling this one. However, I do have to admit some of the emotional moments hit me. Like Clint with his sister and his niece and the boy running for president which is why I gave it a 6 instead of 5. Other than that, I just didn't care. I called Will Ferrel being Scrooge from the beginning but that's still interesting I guess. The songs were mid and somewhat catchy but not something that I'll think about. I wouldn't listen to it for fun. I think ""Good Afternoon"" is funny but the cab driver saying it at night time made no sense. Anyways, I have mixed feelings about this movie. I don't know if I liked it or not."
The Big Sleep (1946),The Big Sleep,"""General Sternwood"" (Charles Waldron) has two daughters and poor old private detective ""Philip Marlowe"" (Humphrey Bogart) might be forgiven for ever getting involved with a case that sees him employed to investigate a case of blackmail against his youngest - ""Carmen"" (Martha Vickers). It looks like she is the target of the venal rare book seller ""Geiger"" but swiftly we realise that that's just the tip of an iceberg that includes not just that blackmail, but another one - with the duplicitous ""Joe"" (Louis Jean Heydt) and then there's the missing ""Regan"" which takes him fairly and squarely into the scheming orbit of the other daughter ""Vivian"" (Lauren Bacall). Soon he's chasing his tail, getting thumped, tied up, shot at - and all whilst he slowly falls for his femme fatale. Who's pulling the strings and why? The story itself isn't the most complex - it's a fairly standard Raymond Chandler adventure. What makes this positively glow are the performances. Bogart and Bacall exude a chemistry that's understatedly provocative. Bacall, especially, uses the less-is-more style with a flash of her eyes or a gesture from her cigarette; Bogart just needs to smile or shrug. It comes alive. The effective use of rain, light, shade and a strong support from Vickers and Bob Steele as crooked henchman ""Canino"" all help this to create an atmosphere of menace tinged with some dark humour and presented via a strong script. Howard Hawks knows how to let his stars get on with it, and he delivers well with this compelling and superior example of Hollywood at it's very best."
The Big Sleep (1946),The Big Sleep,"Howard Hawks crime noir has one big problem. It is hard to figure out what the plot is about. Two characters are talked about and never even appear on screen. Their deaths occur off camera. The reason was the original version of Raymond Chandler's pulp story was reworked and recut by Hawks two years after the movie was completed. The version released in 1946 had some exposition removed hence the confusion. It also added a bit more sleaze, double entendres and more of Lauren Bacall. Humphrey Bogart is the hard boiled, tough as old boots former ADA turned private eye Philip Marlowe. He has been hired by the infirm General Sternwood who is being blackmailed by a bookseller over his wild daughter Carmen. He also has an Irish protege who has gone missing. His older daughter Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) has gambling debts and knows that the blackmailing over some naughty photos of Carmen. All roads lead to shady casino owner Eddie Mars. His wife ran off with the Irishman and his tentacles are everywhere. What The Big Sleep has going for it is the combination of Bogart and Bacall. Hawks skirting around censorship laws and some smart, sassy dialogue."
The Big Sleep (1946),Sleepy But Interesting,"One of the most important agendas director Howard Hawks had for Humphrey Bogart in THE BIG SLEEP - following his breakthrough in HIGH SIERRA followed by THE MALTESE FALCON and CASABLANCA - was to not only sustain his snowballing stardom, but to make him a ravaging sex symbol... Because every woman here wants him... needs him, even... from a sexy librarian, a sexier bookstore employee (Dorothy Malone)... and even a hot female cab driver gets his number, literally, for a possible nighttime tryst... Yet Bogart's private eye Philip Marlowe - adapted from novelist Raymond Chandler - is far too busy after being hired by a rich old man blackmailed about his oldest, troublesome, party-girl daughter Martha Vickers... But what really works is youngest daughter Lauren Bacall's interest in why Marlowe was hired in the first place - more than adding to the perpetually twisting maze that always occurs when the audience knows as much... and as little... as the investigating gumshoe... Who gets so far over his head with tons of last-names spouted in all directions, from or about characters either coming out of the woodwork or already dead, THE BIG SLEEP reaches a point that feels like the third-act wind-down less than halfway through, needing far more of what Lauren Bacall brings to the intentionally cluttered table... She's a relaxing breath-of-fresh-air, even during all the running around that, while well-written, sublimely acted and economically directed, gets downright exhausting while Bacall, despite having secrets of her own, is the only thing that makes complete sense."
The Big Sleep (1946),Terrible,"The story is a muddle, the acting - especially by today's standards , is amateurish, the dialogue is annoyingly contrived, the ""chemistry"" between Bacall and Bogart is weak and unrealistic. For some reason all the ladies want a piece of Marlowe (Bogart), but let's be honest - he's no Clint Eastwood by a long shot. Characters appear for seemingly no real reason, and you wonder who they are and what are they supposed to add to the story. There are long, drawn out unnecessary scenes that do absolutely nothing to drive the story along. Why this film is deemed a classic is beyond me. The Big Sleep is just awful, overrated and a bit of a mess."
The Big Sleep (1946),Read the Book First,"I just read the book a week earlier. Watching this movie through the lens of someone who hasn't read the book and I'm convinced that the story would be next to impossible to follow. To be generous, the Raymond Chandler book was a very recent bestseller so the movie producers might have felt that they could safely gloss over some details without losing the audience. On top of that, the actresses all look strikingly similar, shoulder length blondey brunette's with doe eyes and sharp eyebrows. Where the movie succeeds is in creating that classic film noire hard-boiled detective atmosphere. The Philip Marlowe character seems like the budding archetype for the soon to come James Bond, ladies swooning with innuendo in a very hard to believe manner."
The Big Sleep (1946),The second of four Bogie and Becall pairing,"(1946) The Big Sleep
CRIME DRAMA Quintessential film noir adapted from the popular character created by the Raymond Chandler novel starring Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe stumbling upon many twists and turns, after a big long sleep! Screenplay co-written by famed novelist William Faulkner! Also starring is Lauren Becall as Vivian whose somewhat involved with all the double crossings and murder coverups! I just watched this film again, but this time with the close captioning on this time and I'm still trying to make sense out of everything, but is not really the point anyway since it's not trying to make sense with intentions was it, was to become resonating are the mood and atmosphere and characters, especially between Bogart and Becall."
The Big Sleep (1946),Classic film noir,"It's film noir set in Los Angeles in the 1940s following a private detective trying to sort a complex blackmail case. This version is a slight variant from a pre-release 1945 rendition seen by U. S. troops. Elderly General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) hires Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to investigate possible blackmail of one of his daughters. Sternwood has two 20-ish daughters. Vivian (Lauren Bacall), in her 20s, is widowed and living back in her father's home. Carmen (Martha Vickers), the younger daughter, has a drug problem and is entirely irresponsible. She has considerable debts to bookstore owner, A. G. Geiger (Theodore von Eltz). After being intercepted by Vivian before leaving the Sternwood house, Marlowe begins to pursue Geiger. The film then follows Marlowe sorting out the disappearance of a recent Sternwood employee, two complex blackmail cases, and an increasing series of murders in which the links are unclear. A significant player is gambler Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), whom Vivian protects from Marlowe even as their own relationship heats up. ""The Big Sleep"" is a classic film noir. The dialogue is clipped 1940s tough guy. The sizzle between Bogart and Bacall is similar to that in ""To Have and Have Not."" They married soon after ""The Big Sleep"" was completed. It's a complex plot, and some characters like Agnes Lowzier (Sonia Darrin) and Harry Jones (Elisha Cook) appear and disappear almost too quickly. The storyline moves briskly and the black-and-white cinematography is filled with darkness, fog, and rain."
The Big Sleep (1946),Such Great Dialogue!,"Bogart is awesome in this flick. He's a tough guy, a ladies man and a genius to solve the crime (which was way too convoluted for me to figure out). The dialogue in this movie was awesome and Bogart delivers his lines perfectly. Who else could toss money at a female cab driver and say, ""Here you go sugar. Buy yourself a cigar."" And when he said: ""You know, you're the second guy I've met today that seems to think a gat in the hand means the world by the tail"" I had to rewind it twice because it was so great. Like I said, the plot was too tough to follow and there were way too many characters to keep track of, but the writing and acting was so great it barely mattered."
The Big Sleep (1946),Quite a High Sheep Count...,"Here's a film that might tie you in knots, as it untangles with plenty of shots, quite a curious reveal, as the layers are unpeeled, a film noir that's like a dot to dot. At its core is one Philip Marlowe, takes a hold at the start - gets a tow, although why, when and who, will leave it up to you, as the suspects expand, swell and grow. In the end you might give a big sigh, you might even let escape a big cry, but there'll be no big sleep, you won't need to count sheep, unless the coil is released and you die (god forbid, there's enough of that already). It's a great film, with great performances and you might only have to revisit it a few times to understand the make it up as you go along story."
The Big Sleep (1946),"crazy plot, charismatic stars","An entertaining mixed bag reaction from me. Movie's noirish, humorous style to spare, and charismatic leads overcome an increasingly convuluted story of blackmail, drug fueled jealousy, coverups, and murder. The fun, clever, snappy tough guy dialogue, zingers, trashy sexy femme fatale vibes , and dynamic pairing of Bogey and Bacall all make up for the storyline flaws. Hawks' supporting players are also well cast, especially the ladies. A few of them rival Bacall in stunning beauty, especially. Martha Vickers. And it's amusing that every woman in this movie are instantly attracted to Bogie's tough guy smart ass cool."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom,"In what was one of Hollywood's first indictments of itself, faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) offers young, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) the opportunity to stay with her in her lavish, antiquated mansion, where she lives in recluse, dreaming of her bygone days as one of the once budding industry's brightest stars - and hoping that her latest script will give her one last taste of the fame she's incurably addicted to. Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom with shrewdness and doubtless first-hand knowledge. But after 70 years of aging, Sunset Boulevard only fully works on that allegorical level. The rest of the movie, with its looming tragedy and noirish shadows, is a little too plotted and melodramatic to really resonate, despite - or perhaps partly because - Swanson's outlandish performance as the ageing diva. She's a ghost of the expressionist traditions she was brought up in, and she's blind to the fact that she's become a parody of her own screen-persona. As the picture revels in this parody, with sprinkles of black comedy which alas are too slight and far between, it does still create its own atmospheric realm that partly explains Joe's lunacy. Thanks to Wilder's skill and an invested William Holden, Sunset Boulevard transports you back to 1950's Hollywood and gives you a fascinating glimpse into its world of theatricality, decline and debauchery."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),Wilder's Hollywood Babylon,"Starting off the year in the right way. One of Wilder's finest and most complex work, surely; a film ahead of its time, eternal, I guess. Norma's character was brilliantly arduous to decipher. A unique performance which ended up highlighting the signs of obvious illness. I guess it'd have worked better if they saved the major plot-twist (or what could've been one) at the end, without showcasing it in the first minutes, something that many years later its film brother Mulholland Drive would take inspiration from. An ending that feels like Hitchcock in Psycho, where the constant looking of the cameras give a different kind of creepy tone to it."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),Desolation Row,"Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered one of the most biting satires of classic Hollywood. A cruel tale of the capriciousness of movie fandom. In his mockery of the industry's sordidness, Wilder turns the history of Tinseltown inside out. He tells a story where a former silent star plays an aging movie diva. Her butler is portrayed by ""The Man You Love to Hate"" - Erich von Stroheim. And yet Billy Wilder himself hadn't come to America until he was almost 30 years old. The director was born in 1906, in the small village of Sucha, Austria-Hungary. When Billy Wilder was 20 he moved to Berlin where he began working as a screenwriter. After the Nazi Party's rise to power, he fled to the United States. There, Wilder finally ended up in Hollywood where he could continue his career in film. In 1939 Wilder had his first success with ""Ninotchka"", a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. Swedish superstar Greta Garbo appeared in the lead, which, by the way, was her first role in a romantic comedy. ""Sunset Boulevard"" began life as a comedy. As work progressed, however, the script became more melodramatic than funny. Wilder first offered the main role to Greta Garbo. When she declined, he turned to Gloria Swanson instead. Then, Montgomery Clift was approached for the male lead, but he wasn't interested. According to him, the notion of an innocent young man being kept by a 60-year-old woman was downright disgusting. The part eventually went to William Holden. Hardly surprising, ""Sunset Boulevard"" became the most anticipated film of the year. The magazine ""Newsweek"" even put Gloria Swanson on its cover before the release. And William Holden's performance reignited his, at the time, dwindling stardom. So, even if the movie was offending Hollywood's powerful moguls, ""Sunset Boulevard"" was rewarded with 11 Academy Award nominations. Billy Wilder himself took home one of them for having written the screenplay."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),A mesmerizing journey into 1950s Hollywood decadence and faded stardom: a cinematic masterpiece!,"A masterpiece. The whole cast is superb. An iconic film from the 1950s. The film noir atmosphere is moody and evocative. The film set piece of Norma Desmond's decaying mansion is decadent but has a ghostly quality where it's seen more fulfilled days. Which yes, it has. Norma is still holding on to her past glory days of fame as a silent film star and she finds this easier to deal with having screenwriter Joe Gillis be her companion and, in her mind, more than that. A film about obsession, pessimism, ageism and Hollywood's cruel treatment of stars who outlived their heyday. A MUST-WATCH for all film lovers."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),"Sunset Boulevard: a journey into Hollywood's heart of darkness, headed by Gloria Swanson's layered acting masterclass","As the movie capital of the world, Los Angeles has always managed to capture people's imaginations. This goes all the way back to the early 20th century, when the advent of the big studios brought about the first Golden Age during the roaring '20 and Hollywood became the center of the film industry. Film became in fact an industry, presenting itself as a 'dream factory', selling to the public the idea of the American dream. This industry was built on bonafide stars, good-looking men and women with whom the audience could identify and who, in their pictures, overcame obstacles to achieve success. Stars like Norma Desmond (or Gloria Swanson, for that matter). In selling the public their dreams, Hollywood has attracted many hopefuls in search or their own American dream. People from all over the world with dreams of being in front of (or sometimes behind) the camera, of becoming the next big star and seeing their name up in lights. Up until this day, Los Angeles is a lightning rod for hordes of aspiring actors/actresses or other artistic hopefuls. Obviously, Hollywood itself is in no small part guilty of sustaining its own myth. Most films about 'the movies' perpetuate this romanticized version of Hollywood as a magical place where dreams come true and anything is possible ""if you just want it enough"". Sunset Boulevard, however, takes a somewhat different approach: through the story of a would-be screenwriter and a washed-up movie star, it offers us a blunt examination of the dark side of Hollywood, a cruel industry with a short memory that stifles creativity and ambition and is quick to dispose of its expendables. We follow B-movie screenwriter Joe Gillis, unable to sell his work and struggling to make ends meet. He is ready to go back to his hometown in Ohio, when a fateful incident makes him stumble upon the decaying Sunset Boulevard mansion of faded silent-movie star Norma Desmond. All but forgotten by the movie-going public and living in isolation, Norma is delusional, believing that fans are still longing for her and that she will make a triumphant return to the big screen. She proposes Joe to move in and help her finish the script that will propel her back into the spotlight. Initially reluctant, but ultimately seduced by the comfort of Norma's wealth, Joe agrees and basically becomes her gigolo. With its brutal dissection of an equally ruthless industry, Sunset Boulevard doesn't so much deconstruct the Hollywood myth as shatter it completely. It looks into the gaping mouth of the monster, one that chews up its stars and spits them out whenever it's done with them. Former stars like Norma are abandoned, neglected by studio executives and the public alike, desperately clinging to their glory days and longing to return to the spotlight. Norma roams the ruin that is her mansion like a vampire, a relic of an older time, in search of a purpose in a fast-changing world. This the fate of the lucky few, the talented people who in addition were fortunate enough to once achieve such success. For the other 99%, the common suckers like Joe, who are either untalented or unlucky, Hollywood is simply a place where dreams go to die. They are never even chewed up by the monster in the first place, but rather spit out immediately. In the world of Sunset Boulevard, these are the people that end up on a bus home to Ohio, their heads hanging in shame. Either that or they become gigolos for middle-aged, mentally disturbed former movie stars, one false move away from ending up face down in the pool of a broken down mansion. Gloria Swanson's gloriously outlandish performance is fully deserving of its iconic status in film history. Her histrionics and over-the-top facial expressions are perfectly suited to the (once) larger-than-life star of the silent movie era, Norma Desmond. She gets to deliver classic lines like ""I AM big, it's the pictures that got small."" Or, when Joe suggests that her script needs a bit more dialogue: ""What for? I can say anything I want with my EYES."" The fact that this was a comeback role (sorry, a RETURN) for Swanson, who in real life was one of the grand dames of Golden Age Hollywood and star of many Cecil B. De Mille's films, obscures the line between fact and fiction. This meta-aspect adds a fascinating extra layer of intrigue to her performance and the film's commentary on Hollywood's shameful treatment of its talent. ""Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio"", Norma Desmond's claims at one point in the film, but it might as well be Gloria Swanson herself speaking. Swanson's flashiest scene (in a movie full of them) comes at the very end, in an epilogue that is both compelling and deeply tragic. As Norma is about to be arrested for the murder of Joe, she has lost all touch with reality and has disappeared fully into her own dream world. The last scene of the film is transcendent. As Norma comes down the stairs, her descent into madness is complete. A look of insanity in her eyes, she stares directly into the camera, addressing ""those wonderful people out there in the dark."" At this point, I got literal goosebumps. Such a chilling ending, utterly devastating, but perhaps also somehow some sort of perverted tribute to the allure of the spotlight and the magic of the movies? In any case, for me it is up there with the greatest endings of all time. Finally, a word on this film's legacy. It is interesting to see how Sunset Boulevard inspired more films to look at Hollywood through this darker, more cynical lens, like The Player, Birdman, or my all-time favorite film, Mulholland Drive. Sunset Boulevard was undoubtedly a huge inspiration for David Lynch. There are little references throughout his filmography (FBI-agent Gordon Cole!), but specifically the parallels with his own magnum opus are remarkable. There are many plot and thematic similarities and even the title is a nod to this film. Most importantly, just like Sunset Boulevard, Mulholland Drive offers a scathing criticism of the soulless nature of Hollywood and the destructive effect that the movie industry can have on ambitious and talented people. The general concept of an (aspiring) actress in search of an illustrious career on the big screen, gradually growing more disillusioned, before finally giving way to insanity, is the same, but being the singular filmmaker that he is, Lynch of course put his own uniquely nightmarish twist on it. With Mulholland Drive, David Lynch pretty much made it a wrap for the 'cynical exploration of the dark side of Hollywood' subgenre, effectively making it pointless for anyone to have another stab at it. However, it is probably safe to say that Mulholland Drive would have never been made, had it not been for Sunset Boulevard (by Lynch's own admission, it is one of his favorite films ever made)."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),Billy Wilder's best film,"The above statement is, of course, never an easy, or definitive pick - there is an ever vast and ever impressive filmography belonging to said master auteur in many genres - but I, along with most critics, feel that this could be his most defining film. It havng a spot on IMDb's prestigious Top 250 list, and being one of the best film noir films ever made, if not the best. The actors all do an incredible job, all of them legendary names, and all of them doing some career defining acts, truly haunting, somewhat satirical and a tragic and heartbreaking tale overall. The script is beautiful, perfectly paced and sharply written, very melancholy and provides several great angels. The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, ever important in the genre, and something that Wilder always excells at. It is indeed one of the most beautiful features I have ever seen, for sure. Overall, definitely one of the all time greats, and one that is ever recommended for any lover of film, though I would expect most have seen it already. Watch it again, and again!"
Sunset Blvd. (1950),Perfect,"This word has been used for many unnecessary films before, but this time I say it with all sincerity; it's a complete classic. It's a perfect, amazing movie with everything. Shall we talk about Billy Wilder, Gloria Swanson, William Holden and the other actors, the script, the camera use, the music, the subject matter, the editing? Which one should we tell? Indeed, they can all be praised at length. There is an expression; ""To tell Hollywood to Hollywood"". Wilder couldn't have done any better. From the first second to the last, he manages to arouse interest and curiosity in the audience. He can handle drama and tension at the same time, through simple things, but in an impressive way. He extracts sentences from the mouths of his characters in great depth that can be spoken on. With every but every feature, people say, ""This is cinema!"" he's forcing himself to say."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),"Good For Film Lovers, But If Won't Connect with Others Anymore","A down in his luck Hollywood writer suddenly finds himself forced into the delusions of a washed up old-time Hollywood actress. The movie isn't bad, but I do t necessarily think it should remain as one of the best films of all time. To be fair, the acting is quite good, and most of the writing is clever. However, I found it a challenging film to take seriously and in which to suspend my disbelief. I understand that it is somewhat based on a set of real situations, but I simply was not taken with it. I think true film buffs would love this movie, if not for the nostalgia. But it won't resonate with most audiences."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),"The Twilight Zone"" episode ""The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine"" is better","(1950) Sunset Boulevard
DRAMA Co-written and directed by Billy wilder, that has right from the start of this film, the viewer observes a dead body floating in a pool and we are left to ask several questions like how did it get there and who is it and why!! Then comes the narration where it starts to use the ""Rashomon"" formula of point of view and the whole narration is done from one point of view ( and a strange one that is )and by the end, everything comes to make sense. Directed by Billy Wilder whose best known for directing ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment"" with Jack Lemmon. The reason for this rating is because although it's well acted, directed and is self explanatory, the film didn't really offer me what I don't know about the industry that I couldn't find out for myself on my own. As well, that the film industry is definitely not what it's used to be anymore. So even though it kept my eyes peeled in some retrospects it's a little outdated."
Sunset Blvd. (1950),A script writer's outrageously enjoyable worst nightmare,"Whatever you may think about Billy Wilder's coldly detached and almost cynical approach to human affairs, you have to admit that in this piercing settlement with the Hollywood phenomenon and cult he strikes to the very core of the problems of the dream factory. Norma Desmond, once the greatest star of all, has got stuck in the greatness of her glorious past to the degree that she no longer has any connection with reality, and the only thing she is living for is her return to the glory of her past. An impoverished screen writer has the misfortune to end up in her extravagant house of incredible luxury and sumptuousness and is caught up in her dream, which leads him into a blind alley of irrevocable personal annihilation, which when he tries to break out of it at last only inevitably becomes the end of him. Gloria Swanson makes a magnificent performance twenty years after her departure from her Hollywood glory, and William Holden makes an impossible role possible and tragically credible. Then we have all the cameos or icons, like Buster Keaton, Hedda Hooper, Cecil B. DeMille, Anna Q Nilsson and other living ghosts of the silent era, a great score by Franz Waxman not intruding on the action, and a marvellous cinematography and stage settings, but the top of the masterpiece is the manuscript. Billy Wilder wrote it himself with others, and there is so much gold in it that it has to be termed a literary masterpiece. In brief, the essence of the Hollywood dream factory was never more perfectly compressed into a masterpiece of genius."
Suspicion (1941),Anything Is Possible,"At 24, Joan Fontaine was beautiful enough and talented enough to earn an Academy Award for this Hitchcock suspense picture, told from her character's viewpoint. Somewhat unworldly Lina Laidlaw meets Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) on a train, an impertinent, but charming, bounder. Swept off her feet, she marries him and slowly learns of his questionable character. His designs on a possible inheritance from her censorious father (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) arouse suspicion. Is he a murderer? The version written by satirical novelist, Nathanael West was set aside for this satisfyingly romantic tale a la Hitchcock."
Suspicion (1941),"For the superficial ending that it showed, I give it an 8. One of those movies I disagreed with Hitchcock about","(1941) Suspicion
PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER Adapted from the novel ""Before the Fact"" by Francis Iles co-produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock that has socialite, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) meeting and then eloping with dashing playboy, Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). And very slowly viewers know more and more about the supposedly wonderful man Johnnie is supposed to be, as the longer she continues to live with him, the more she becomes convinced he wants to murder her. If it did not have the superficial ending that it did, I do not think I would have liked it. History says that Hitchcock wanted to align the movie the same way as the book, except that producers were against it."
Suspicion (1941),Hitchcock and his story,"""Suspicion"" of 1941, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a cinematic masterpiece that not only confirms the skill and unique style of the director, but also represents an amazing work as a detective thriller. One of the main aspects that makes this film so outstanding is the ability of a masterful director to create an intriguing atmosphere from the very beginning and maintain it throughout the work. Every scene, every frame is perfectly worked out and turns out to be as intense as possible. Cary Grant deserves special attention for his impeccable performance as the main character. His performance is so convincing that the viewer is completely immersed in his world and experiences every emotion that the hero experiences. Grant conveys the nuances of hysteria and suspicion well, which will not leave any viewer indifferent. And the scenario moves allow the viewer to guess the whole movie who this mysterious hero really is. The heroine performed by Joan Fontaine is also good. The girl gave a great character. I consider her victory at the Oscar in the Best Actress nomination absolutely deserved. No less surprising is the virtuoso execution of the characteristic features of Hitchcock's style. Without exaggeration, every frame of the film is a work of art. From detailed camera angles to the play of light and shadow, each scene looks as if it was created to make the audience sit at the edge of their seats. ""Suspicion"" is not just a film, it is a cinematic calling card of the author, which becomes another vivid example of the magnificent work of Alfred Hitchcock. This is a film that impresses with its intelligence, passion and unpredictability. If you are a fan of Hitchcock or just like good movies, then this movie is a must-see work. 7 out of 10."
Suspicion (1941),One of Hitchcock's best,"Alfred Hitchcock, the name need only be said to invoke a sense of greatness in every lover of film. The master of suspense himself, he has provided an ever impressive and vast filmography of suspenseful dramas - and this one, whilst perhaps not one of his more well known, is an ever incredible and ever exciting film with incredible acting that I would highly recommend. Hitch's usual level of suspense, sharp writing and great character work is ever present, and he does wonders as usual. The cinematography, cutting and editing is as always beautiful. Truly a great piece. Overall, a highly recommended film for any lover of film and fans of Hitchcock!"
Suspicion (1941),WWII reaction,"When I saw this movie, I was very curious as to how Brits would see Johnnie's character and I almost forgot about the American reaction--the audience to whom Hitchcock would most favour given the movie was shot in Hollywood. As the US soldiers were not in the war until after the movie was made, Cary Grant's star quality would endear him to American audiences as intended or at least keep them quite intrigued to see if he was just a lovable conman or a real murderer. I think though that British audiences would have been quite puzzled by the English setting, the free style trips to Europe for the honeymoon as well as the Beaky trip and just the lack of any reference to the war in 1941. British men and women would find the free-wheeling Johnnie particularly nasty in his behaviour next to what British men and women were sacrificing at the time. I was very curious that I found no reference to this in any reviews. It was almost as if Hitchcock had set the movie in a very different time period perhaps 1932 the date of the book on which the movie was based. There certainly seem to be some deliberate choices, perhaps dictated by the studio, given that Hitchcock did not shy away from bringing the war into some of his later psychological thrillers."
Suspicion (1941),When manipulative personalities create a veil of fear and distrust,"How do we deal with suspicious personalities around us? Well, this movie takes it to the extreme when manipulative spouses create such an atmosphere that every negative event around is somehow linked to the said person. Manipulation creates an atmosphere of distrust that is similar to the ""boy who cried wolf"" - even when the manipulative party is visually inactive, we still raise our suspisions to find links how the manipulative party worked around to achieve their mischevious plans. Even us, the viewer, fall into the trap of suspicion that makes us accuse the manipulative party even without any concrete evidence. That just means the movie has achieved in portraying how manipulative personalities emotionally ruin those close to them and what madness lies in the head of the devoted manipulated. I find this Hitchcock movie rather fascinating on the physological realm. Besides the mentioned points, we also get to witness how the spouse experiences inner turmoil between love for her husband and hate for his manipulative ways unfolds."
Suspicion (1941),liked it,"Stories about psychopaths are hard for me to take, but I thought it was very well done. Some people seemed disappointed with the ending that apparently exonerated him. I didn't see it that way. There were so many cases of rotten behavior on his part and then suspicious potential incidents of heinous acts, which then had an innocent explanation, but you could never be sure. And the incidents at the end seemed to me to be just as ambiguous. Was the guy merely a really screwed up person, or was he a full blown psychopathic killer? To me the movie leaves that up in the air, and that was a satisfying ending in my opinion."
Suspicion (1941),Not top quality for Hitch or the actors,"This film and these performances are very flawed. Fontaine won an Oscar (which was really for Rebecca) for this neurotic, melodramatic, and vapid performance, one which always shows up on those 'worst Oscar' lists. Cary Grant was much better at his part, but the problem is that his character is both unlikable and unbelievable. His wife, somewhat of a simp, ascribes his terrible behavior to 'you're such a boy!' Which shows how old fashioned the morals are in the film. As for Hitch, the pacing is slow, the tone is inconsistent (is it a farce? A romance? A murder mystery?), and the ending destroys all his tedious work to build tension. Instead watch Stranger on a Train or Rope to get the fully realized Hitch directing."
Suspicion (1941),Too Many Holes,"John Asgar did kill Binky and wanted to and tried to kill his wife. Every single detail, time, place and the motive all added up. The story didn't even go to the trouble to develop a counter argument based on other possible information to explain a different conclusion. Asgar was a seasoned con artist, cheat, scoundrel and murderer. Just because Grant was in the role, they should not have gone against logic and turned to an illogical ending. It almost ruined a suspenseful movie that could have been great if not for that ending. Each time I watch I wonder what was the director thinking and why would the studio ruin it in some feeble attempt to protect Grant's good guy reputation. He didn't win anything for the movie and may have won an Academy Award without the botched ending in place."
Suspicion (1941),One of Hitchcock's best films,"It surprises me that I rarely see this ""suspicion"" on lists of the best AH films. The film is fabulous, starting at a light and comic pace and progressively evolving into a tense atmosphere of ""film-noir"", with great mystery and ""suspense"" and with an ""open"" ending that does not clarify (I think on purpose) all the intrigue, always remaining in doubt. This progression of genres in the film is accomplished by Hitchcock with great subtlety and skill. Fantastic performances by Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. It is part of my TOP 5 of Hitchcock, along with ""psycho"", ""vertigo"", ""north by northwest"" and ""dial m for murder"". My rating: 9/10."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),The System becomes the Gangster,James Cagney is a charismatic gangster who has influence over young boys in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Pat O'Brian is a priest trying to influence the angels with dirty faces. The lawyer Humphry Bogart is corrupt. The media manipulates the people with its headlines of violence. Violence becomes seductive in this 1938 film about manipulation. Telephones are used to make quick calls to influence events. Money can manipulate people. The film is about the system becoming more corrupt than an individual. Corruption is contagious. The infantile thrill of a shootout outweighs the choir voices. Father Pat O'Brian has little appeal against the physicality and money of Cagney. He lies to the boys. The boys dress differently. They wear hats and jackets like Cagney. Cagney has a terrible end and the system that arrested him as a boy is to blame. O'Brian ran faster and escaped reform school.
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),Once the Dye is Cast...,"The fork begins to split after attempting to commit, a theft from rolling stock that starts the countdown of a clock, where the option Jerry takes, means that he'll get all the breaks, and the dice that roll for you, leaves you locked in a curfew. Some years later, in a cycle, you return to your old ground, where you're looking to recoup, from an acquaintance a few grand, but there's cheating and deception, though you find yourself protection, it all leads to a big shoot out, with a pistol in each hand. Alas you're captured and convicted and then sentenced to the chair, you are cool and quite collected and the thought just does not scare, but does a chat turn you all yella, is it for real, are you that fella, and does it really make a difference to remove future despair."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),A Flawed Hero and a Questionable Priest,"The movie is well-made for the era, featuring tense action sequences, witty dialogue, and realistic settings. Rocky in particular exhibits glimmers of humanity and remorse beneath his hard exterior, making him one of the most well-developed and complex characters. In addition, the movie raises ethical concerns about how the government, the media, and the church shape public opinion and social behaviour. But there are some problems with the movie as well. The priest's plot against the corrupt politicians and gangsters seems contrived and unrealistic. His final visit to Rocky in prison is disappointing, as he does not offer him any spiritual comfort or guidance, but only asks him to pretend to be a coward in front of the kids. He also assaults a reporter in an earlier scene, which undermines his credibility as a moral authority. The film's ending is ambiguous and controversial, leaving the audience to wonder if Rocky's last act was sincere or staged. Another weakness of the film is the portrayal of the kids, who are supposed to be Rocky's admirers and Father Connolly's proteges. They seem like real brats who are rude, rebellious, and disrespectful to everyone. They do not show any gratitude or remorse for their actions, and they do not seem to learn anything from their experiences. They are not worth saving anyway, as they are likely to follow Rocky's footsteps or end up in jail or worse. They are not sympathetic or relatable characters, but rather annoying and irritating ones. Overall, Angels with Dirty Faces is a compelling and entertaining film that deserves its place in cinematic history. It offers a fascinating portrait of a flawed hero who struggles with his conscience and his fate. It also challenges the viewers to reflect on their own values and beliefs."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),Don't believe what you read,"My view of this film is undoubtedly influenced by my opinion of James Cagney. I never used to like him and then one day, something happened inside me, and things just clicked into place. I now think he is great value in anything I see with him. It's inexplainable but I now really like him. I find the same with Elisha Cook Junior. The fact that the Dead End kids were in this film would have normally turned me off watching it in the first place, and I don't care much for them in this film, but Cagney's presence somehow negates the irritation I feel whenever I see Leo Gorcey. After spending time in jail, gangster Cagney (Rocky) visits his lawyer friend Humprey Bogart (Frazier) to claim his $100,000.00 dollars but Bogart tells him that things are now different and so we now have 2 rivals and Bogey doesn't care for Cagney breathing air. These two connive against each other whilst Cagney expresses his softer side by looking after a bunch of kids - the Dead End kids - in his home town. Maybe they can learn to behave themselves under his guidance. His old friend Pat O'Brien (Jerry) is now the priest of the parish and also hopes that Cagney can turn away from his criminal activities to help the community and serve good for the troublesome teenagers. The ending isn't very realistic, it's wishful thinking but I don't think the film should be knocked for veering off in this direction. The message is sound - change your ways if you can and youare on the slippery slope to ruin, and sacrifice your ego if you think your actions can benefit others. The ending is memorable for this. Just shrug your shoulders and say ""Don't be a sucker, see"" in a Jimmy Cagney manner and witness how you feel much better instantaneously."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),One of the lamest endings ever to an otherwise enjoyable film,"Angels with Dirty Faces is a film depicting the fictional story of Rocky Sullivan, a hoodlum-turned-gangster. The bombastic opening music by Max Steiner makes it very apparent that this is 'classic' Hollywood. I'm always fascinated by the way in which society is portrayed in movies from the 30's/40's and thus I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue and characters in this movie. From the young hoodlums referring to the police as 'coppers', to the main character sometimes ending his sentences with 'see' to the group dynamic of the hoodlums, it's all wonderful. The plot is quite straightforward, Rocky Sullivan (played by an immensely charismatic James Cagney) and his buddy, Jerry Connolly get busted while stealing from a train. Rocky gets caught while his friend gets away. While in the juvenile detention system, Rocky gets deeper and deeper into trouble and its there he gets his real gangster education. During a montage we see him in and out of jail, eventually you see him 'taking the blame' for a case that he seemingly did together with his lawyer James Frazier (played by Humphrey Bogart - who was the reason I picked this film up). The loot is $100,000 and Rocky intends to get his money when he gets out of jail. Rocky gets released, moves into his old neighborhood where he befriends some young hoodlums. Rocky wants his money from Humphrey Bogart, who puts out a hit on him. Rocky retaliates, finds some dirt on Bogart and gets his $100,000 back. Eventually his childhood 'friend', who has become a catholic priest, decides to do everything in his power to stop Rocky by slandering him in the newspapers which results in Rocky and Humphrey falling out, at which point Humphrey is killed. The police show up, arrest Rocky (who gets a death sentence), then the lame priest shows up and asks Rocky to cry and appear afraid at the execution so the young hoodlums won't look up to him. Rocky then obliges after which everyone (including the audience) is disappointed. I would've gave the film a 7, since I enjoyed it, but the lame, preachy ending really ruined it. I'd love to see a sequel in which the next local criminal turns out to be a *real* piece of junk and the priest summons Jesus to bring Rocky back. Rocky then beats the sense out of the criminal and makes the priest convert to Rastafarianism. 5.5/10."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),Outdated despite likable cast,"(1938) Angels With Dirty Faces
CRIME DRAMA A very generic simplistic storyline if a movie like this were made today centering on well intention gangster played by James Cagney idolized by ""the Dead End Kids"" getting mixed up with bad gangster Humphrey Bogart. Ed O' Brien plays a pastor which the Cagney character saves. (contains spoilers) I may have liked this film at the time it was made but not so much anymore since I did not like the fact that the Cagney character first 'saves' his brother the pastor's life than gets punished for that by means of being sentenced to death, and then his pastor brother has the gall to ask him for a favor of showing fear by means of tears and so forth before he gets put into the chair... that scene has got to be one of the ""cheesiest"" scenes in movie history. And I also do not like the fact that the film sympathizes with the Cagney character and then kills him off just because he's a well intention gangster who just happens to associate with some bad apples- that doesn't make any sense especially when they're worst gangsters than him such as Capone and so forth and they get life in prison."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),What do you hear? What do you say?,Classic movie featuring the Dead End Boys with plenty to culture one from abroad. Watch James Cagney in one of his best roles by watching Angels with Dirty faces. A+
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),"Decades later, a case where real life failed miserably to imitate art","You know the setup: life-long friends Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connelly end up, respectively, as a gangster and a Catholic priest. Father Jerry's church is a sanctuary for wayward youths, with Rocky helping out financially. Rocky finally gets his just dessert with a death sentence to be carried out at Sing Sing Prison, New York. The teenage boys at Jerry's church are impressed with Rocky's successes as a gangster, in spite of his being caught and sentenced to death. Father Jerry asks Rocky, just before the execution, to act like a coward so that he is not a martyr for the boys. Rocky went to the Hot Seat wailing and crying for mercy, and it was reported so in the papers. In 1979, a brutal killer named Jesse Bishop needlessly gunned down a honeymooner during an attempted robbery of a casino in Las Vegas. Bishop got the gas chamber (the last time it was ever used). After the execution, the prison's Warden, for reasons I'll never understand, told the media that Bishop had faced his fate with stoic courage, implying unmistakably that Bishop was a real tough guy. Apparently the Warden had never seen Angels With Dirty Faces, and he certainly didn't have any understanding of the effect his comments may have on those who fancied themselves tough guys and impressed with such drivel."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),Great classic that left me thinking.,"I think this is the first James Cagney film I've watched completely ... although I might have a memory of maybe sitting thru Yankee Doodle Dandy when I was young with Dad. Really, really enjoyed this film selected from the 1000 book ... and not just because I love old films. The story was great and the acting was too - considering it was 1938. I did laugh at how Rocky was firing his gun - almost like he was throwing the bullets from it. A nice surprise to immediately recognise Pepi from Shop Around The Corner as Young Jerry. Especially liked the ending. Was he doing as his old pal wanted in going out yellow ... or did he really crumble and beg for his life? A wonderful decision for the viewer to make in their own mind ... and I normally HATE that kind of ambiguity. 83/100."
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),What does friendship prepare for us afterward or a Philosophical parable of gangster America,"Crime drama, noir. I wanted to look at this picture last year because of Humphrey Bogart (and another ""Treasures of the Sierra Madre"", but I'll tell you about it next time), but everything didn't work out, but now I found the time. And the result made me pretty happy, because the picture was worth watching and even made me think about some things. And here's my brief opinion for you - a philosophical parable of gangster America. There are no minuses in the picture, but there is some remark that I will write in a separate paragraph, and it's time to focus your attention on the expressive merits of this gangster drama. So, here they are:
1. Scenario - in the center of the story is the fate of two friends who, as children, were still mischievous and pranksters, but as a result of an unsuccessful robbery, one goes to prison, and the second manages to escape. The first, after many years of prisons and colonies, becomes a famous gangster and returns to his hometown and visits a friend who has become a priest during this time. And if everything was fine between them before, now they are on opposite sides of the barricades, and after all, the gangster does not intend to turn off the crooked road, and the priest wants to save the soul of a friend from eternal torment. That's right, we have an ordinary crime drama in the scenery of America in the thirties, where friendship is at the center of the story. The characters are bright and interesting, even secondary, everyone has a personality, and everyone can sympathize and find their weak spot. The picture is about the choice made by every person who has entered the criminal path and about the people who want to return it. The finale turned out to be very strong and emotional, even despite its brevity. And in general there are no unnecessary scenes here, everything is clear and to the point. If you miss interesting and well-developed crime dramas, and also noir, then do not miss this picture in any case! 2. The atmosphere is gangster America of the thirties in all its glory: shootings, fights, everyday murders, gangsters in stylish business suits and with big money, corrupt officials and policemen, street kids admiring these same gangsters, intimidated townsfolk and a few brave souls who decide to challenge this whole corrupt system. There are a decent number of fights and shootouts in the picture, and they are made just fine for the late thirties. Everything is fast and brutal (although there is no blood). I love paintings and TV series that unfold in this historical period, and here the picture was shot in the late thirties, when memories are still alive and when this era began to fade into the past. 3. Morality - what I like about crime films or TV series with the main characters of criminals is the obligatory morality that such a life will not lead to good. Yes, at first you will be happy with a lot of money and that power, but even if you are not killed by competitors, you will still end your life not in the best way, and this picture shows it perfectly. Although the first picture that clearly demonstrated this for me personally is ""Scarface"" with Al Pacino, but the roots come from the paintings of the twenties and thirties of the last century. 4. Parable - it's not for nothing that I called the picture a philosophical parable in gangster America, because it is full of cruelty and gloom, and at the same time faith in a better future for young boys and girls who lived at that time, because they should not grow up in such a shameless, gloomy and corrupt environment, they should not admire criminals and murderers. And although life has shown that these dreams have not come true, but the very humanistic message and sincerity of this faith are captivating, although it will have to make great sacrifices to realize it. 5. Acting - what can I say, the old school of acting, equally good both in capitalist America and in the communist USSR, when actors tried and did not spare themselves, they were selected suitable roles, and no one dared to fake. Of course, James Cagney, Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart attract the main attention to themselves, but other actors did their best, they looked convincing in the frame and you believe them, although they were all filmed in the pavilion. Now about the remark. There is one scenario blunder that was made for the sake of the development of the story, but logically it ruins the perception a little. This moment is only one, and it does not greatly affect the final grade. A little about the main characters:
1. Rocky Sullivan, played by James Kangi, is a famous gangster and childhood friend of priest Jerry Connolly, who after his release decided to return to his hometown and become his ""gray cardinal"". A bold, bold, cheeky and very ambitious gangster who is admired by many people and whom they want to emulate. No wonder James Kangi was nominated for an Oscar for this role - it's deserved! Bravo James! 2. Jerry Connolly, played by Pat O'Brien, is a priest, a childhood friend of Rocky, who dreams of re-educating his friend and guiding him on the true path. Although he is a man of God, he can safely punch a scoundrel in the face. Pat demonstrated a slightly restless person who is torn between friendship and faith until he makes a final decision. Bravo Pat! 3. James Fraser, played by Humphrey Bogart, is Rocky's lawyer, who ""heated up"" him and is now trying in every way to squeeze him out of his ""small"" business, although Rocky finds a loophole every time to stay at the top of power. It was unusual to see Humphrey in the role of a negative character, but even so he is remembered for his trademark cynicism and sarcastic smile, from which you can expect anything. Bravo Humphrey! If you like noir - run to watch! If you like criminal pictures with interesting scenarios - run to watch! If you like perfectly written characters and interesting situations - run to watch! If you like to think about the questions that the pictures raise - run to look! If you like a great acting game - run to watch! As a result, we have a good gangster drama with noir elements, an excellent philosophical script, bright characters and great acting! My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"
Strangers on a Train (1951),Good stuff but a tad unbelievable,"Strangers On A Train is a taut, thrilling murder film, but I find it inferior to most of Hitchcocks other works. The films flaw is in its premise itself- it seemed quite improbable that the police would believe a raving lunatic over a sane man, and that planting a lighter days after a murder can possibly be much admissible evidence to convict and try Haines. The film is also oddly structured, in that the plot moves rather slowly in the middle hour or so, and the true climax of the film, the really suspenseful, thrilling bits are the last 30 minutes of film. I find that Hitchcocks movies can be so,it into two kinds- action adventure espionage tales normally with a bit of wit and humour in them(North By Northwest, thirty nine steps, lady vanishes) or more serious thrillers with excellent dramatic acting(Notorious, Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo). Strangers On A Train falls squarely into the latter category, but its plot lacks enough tension, and its characters lack enough interpersonal relationships to truly ground and humanise the story. Notorious had a serious love story, Man Who Knew Too Much a family kidnapping story, and Vertigo and obsessive love story. Perhaps this film is most similar to Rope, but I find Rope to be more tautly constructed and more suspenseful. Of course, strangers on a train does have outstanding performances, notably the chilling, psychopathic portrayal of Bruno. It also has beautiful cinematography by Robert Burks. But ultimately, this story felt too cerebral, without a touching romance or drama to ground and humanise the story much."
Strangers on a Train (1951),"A Hitchcock thriller with a whole lot of style, but ultimately lacking in depth","I watched ""Strangers on a Train"" once before and remember, while certainly feeling entertained, not being particularly crazy about it back then. In revisiting the film as part of my Hitchcock marathon, expectations were high, considering its esteemed reputation for being one of the director's best works. Although my understanding of Hitchcock's cinematic language and appreciation of his visual inventiveness has grown since that first viewing, the overall impact of the film, unfortunately, still didn't resonate as strongly with me as it seems to do with almost everybody else. As has been highlighted by many others, the movie boasts several brilliant set pieces that showcase Hitchcock's filmmaking brilliance. I think about the whole murder sequence, from the misdirection in the tunnel, using shadows and screams, to the actual deed being viewed through the lenses of the victim's broken glasses. Later, there's some intricate crosscutting between scenes of a tennis match and a character reaching for his lighter in the sewer, which elevates these ordinary activities to an almost unbearable level of suspense. The film's climax at the carnival is another testament to Hitch's ability to create high levels of tension from seemingly innocuous settings. In ""Strangers on a Train"", rich-kid-with-daddy(-and-mommy)-issues (a Hitchcock trademark) Bruno Anthony approaches tennis pro Guy Haines with his theory for committing the ""perfect murder"" (another director trademark). One of the film's strengths lies in the performance of Robert Walker: he portrays Bruno Anthony as a charming, manipulative playboy who is gradually revealed to be a full-blown lunatic. However, in my opinion, the narrative falls short in fully exploring the potential of the intriguing premise (the ""murder swap""). Hitchcock's best works usually add some element of (moral or other) ambiguity, complex psychology or a plot twist that completely upends our perspective and the way we think of certain characters. ""Strangers on a Train"" doesn't have that additional layer of complication. The characters lack the depth and complexity that elevate Hitchcock's best works. Bruno Anthony is a psychopathic villain without any redeeming qualities (and a possible Oedipus complex). Guy Haines, in equally straightforward manner, is presented as an uncomplicated hero: he doesn't seriously consent with Bruno's plan for the murder swap, even though his wife is clearly shown to be a manipulative monster who cuckolds him. Guy is an upstanding citizen who just had the bad fortune of meeting the wrong stranger on the wrong train, his innocence never in doubt. In the Hitchcock's pantheon, ""Strangers on a Train"" falls into the mid-tier for me. While I could better appreciate the technical finesse this time around, the film ultimately failed to really strike a chord with me beyond its visual bravura. The absence of extra intrigue, whether through engaging character development, interesting thematic elements, or unexpected plot twists, prevents it from being in the upper echelon of Hitchcock's work, occupied by classics like ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""Rebecca"", ""Notorious"", or the in many ways similar, but more richly layered, ""Rope"". Despite some captivating moments , ""Strangers on a Train"" remains a film where the technical brilliance outshines the narrative and thematic depth."
Strangers on a Train (1951),This is a Fun Train Ride,"Strangers on a Train is a mid-career work of Hitchcock's and it's a unique and fun film. All of the performances are right on and the story is interesting. I won't reiterate the story as that's already been covered here enough but I will say that the premise seems like the perfect crime, or pairs of crimes, in the making. So obvious and yet fresh sounding at the same time. But as we know in the movies, in real life, and especially with Hitchcock, things don't always go as expected. Good thing for the viewer because that's where the fun comes in for us. All in all Strangers on a Train is one worth checking out."
Strangers on a Train (1951),7.2/10. Recommended,"I started my Hitchcock journey recently, i have no words to describe his genius. For reference, my ratings are: NOTORIOUS 9/10 VERTIGO 8,9/10. ROPE: 8,2/10. DIAL M FOR MURDER: 8,6/10. THE 39 STEPS : 7,3/10. REAR WINDOW : 8,4/10. THE BIRDS: 7,7/10 MARNIE: 7,2/10. SPELLBOUND : 7,6/10. As you can see, i consider this as the worst Hitchcock movie i've watched. The ""worst"" Hitchcock movie is still a good movie, 7.2/10 is a good rating in my books. There are many classical, Hitchcockian signs and characteristics here. There is suspense, a great acting performance (Robert Walker) and the main idea of this story is brilliant (The criss-cross). However, there is some bad acting here too. Some events are unbelieavable and don't make sense. And the ending is kinda dumb. The ending is like a parody of a Hitchcock movie, like a farce to the viewers. This could be a great movie if it was a dark comedy. Unfortunately, i don't believe it was intentionally funny. In any case, most people who like his movies, will enjoy it."
Strangers on a Train (1951),Exciting moments,"(1951) Strangers On A Train
SUSPENSE THRILLER Adapted from the novel by Patricia Highsmith produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, that has an obsessed fan, Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) of tennis player, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meet in a train proposing for a deal of a double murder. Guy then tries to back out of it, after the wealthy obsessed fan Bruno accomplished his part of the deal is when things get very complicated, when he tries to pin Guy on the murder. Famous for the speeding 'merry go around' scene at the end and although it's an original idea never seen before, almost felt that scene was somewhat imposed, but still very effective nonetheless."
Strangers on a Train (1951),Another great mystery from The Master of Suspense.,"Bruno Antony randomly encounters tennis star Guy Haines on a train, after a while in each other's company, Bruno details a plan for murder, for the pair to carry out killings for each other, thus drawing suspicion and focus away from themselves. I get why this is regarded as a classic for many fans, and rightly so, I thoroughly enjoyed it, I wouldn't perhaps put it up there with the likes of Rear Window, Vertigo and The Birds, but it's still an excellent film. It is full of suspense, it's clever, and it presents us with a tantalising, ingenious murder device, two strangers with zero apparent motive, committing the perfect crimes. I see the ending has gotten criticism of some fans, personally I quite liked it. Robert Walker delivers an extraordinary performance, the whole cast are great, but his chilling, relentless doggedness is the key to the film's success, he has some presence on screen. Granger is also excellent. Impressive visuals, the tennis scenes in particular look great, and good to see that Farley Granger Granger can actually play tennis, it's very rarely the case with films and TV shows. 8/10."
Strangers on a Train (1951),Something of a Hitchcock hidden gem,"Many films from this era can be quite a chore to watch, even if you can appreciate how impressive they were for their time. Strangers On a Train, however, is a brilliant ride that is captivating from start to finish. A great storyline, strong character development and an array of Hitchcock's signature touches all combine to make for one of the most impressive movies of the 50s. The biggest standout though, is the incredible performance from Robert Walker whose mixture of desperation, evil and vulnerability is phenomenal. Farley Granger and Ruth Roman are less impressive, both quite wooden and one-dimensional in contrast to Walker. If, like me, you're on a quest to unearth great films from the 20th century, this is one to add to your watchlist."
Strangers on a Train (1951),quality entertainment,"Fun fact: The global prevalence rate of schizophrenia is approximately 0.5 percent (and most likely underestimated), meaning in a random train involving a random 200 people there IS a chance you could be sitting beside a literal schizophrenic person. Strangers On a Train belongs to a more popcorn-ish side of Alfred Hitchcock's roster of films, while remaining faithful to his prominent characteristics : An innocent suspect no one believes, a cunning villain on the loose, the ever-growing suspense and a plot that is both crazy and believable. It's a film that offers a lot of quality entertainment."
Strangers on a Train (1951),Minds on a Collision Course,"Strangers on a Train opens with a fateful encounter between the tennis star, Guy Haines, and the enigmatic Bruno Antony, a wealthy playboy. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that beneath their surface façades lie layers of complexity and intrigue. The contrast between Guy's seemingly normal demeanor and Bruno's disturbing Oedipus complex and manipulation skills creates a tension that resonates throughout the film. Bruno, a true fan of crime fiction, proposes a seemingly perfect murder plan: each man will commit a murder on behalf of the other, eliminating any motives and casting suspicion away. The film masterfully weaves a web of suspense and moral ambiguity as Guy, initially dismissive of Bruno's bizarre proposal, becomes ensnared in a spiral of crime orchestrated by Bruno himself. Despite the audience's inner urge to intervene and shout advice to Guy, the film captures his gradual entanglement with Bruno in a mesmerizing fashion. Guy's moral compromise and increasing vulnerability are portrayed with exceptional depth, creating a dynamic character arc that keeps viewers riveted. Bruno's enigmatic and manipulative nature adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative. The psychological power play between him and Guy highlights the fine line between influence and control. The film delves into the question of whether individuals can be pushed to commit heinous acts against their better judgment. The exploration of Guy's transformation from a seemingly ordinary man to a participant in a sinister plot raises questions about the duality of human nature and the extent of moral compromise. Alfred Hitchcock's direction shines brilliantly in Strangers on a Train. The film's atmosphere is steeped in tension, psychological depth and morally complex characters. The juxtaposition of normalcy and darkness creates a haunting experience that lingers long after the film ends. The intricate narrative and character dynamics are elevated by Hitchcock's masterful storytelling techniques, resulting in a film that remains timeless in its allure. Strangers on a Train is not merely a film noir but a psychological exploration of crime, manipulation, and the intricate interplay of human emotions. With its suspenseful plot, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes, the film cements its place as a quintessential masterpiece in Hitchcock's illustrious career, inviting audiences to delve into the depths of human psychology and the allure of the unknown."
Strangers on a Train (1951),A psychological portrait of timeless proportions,"Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his career when he made this thriller - one of the most Hitchcockesque of all his movies. The idea upon which the crime plot, concocted by the brilliant Patricia Highsmith, is based is so simplistic and universal that it has an inherent elegance: Two men meet on a train and contemplate the idea of ""swapping murders"". That one of them may take it all a little more seriously than the other creates the basis for the playful perversities that ensue. As with almost all of Hitchcock's movies, the story invites several moral discussions and thematic ambivalences, which the director naturally exploits both narratively and visually. Hitchcock and his cinematographer Robert Burks, who worked together for the first time here, take full advantage of the array of possibilities black-and-white cinematography offers, not least by use of shadows and juxtapositions. These visual hints and suggestions aren't seminal, but they give the story a little extra zest. And they are part and parcel of how Hitchcock ambushes you in his subtle, sneaky way. You cannot help but be taken by Robert Walker's Bruno - even identify with him and his degenerate selfishness. Strangers on a Train is in many ways a much simpler film than other Hitchcock masterpieces such as Vertigo or North by Northwest, but it's a psychological portrait of timeless proportions. A tribute to human debasement, made possible by a wonderful performance from Robert Walker, who reached his zenith here before succumbing to his own demons later the same year."
Double Indemnity (1944),Double Indemnity is Outstanding Film Noir,"The chemistry and charisma of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray smolder and ignite in this classic film noir about a murder for insurance money scheme gone wrong. Expertly filmed and fast-paced, Double Indemnity draws the audience into the swirl of passion, fantasies of riches, and evil plans that unravel faster than the heated passion it took to cook them up in the first place. Barbara Stanwyck brings just the right combination of looks, smarts and emotional manipulation to the role as the wife who wants her husband dead. The audience sees insurance agent/Stanwyck stooge Fred MacMurray's detached and cynical facade shift as he turns into a calculating plotter of murder, followed by his helpless entrapment as the walls close in by unexpected circumstances as the insurance scheme unravels. In his role as MacMurray's boss, Edward G. Robinson's cunning realization that the supposed accident staged for a huge insurance payout was a fraud all along adds a fiery and intellectual topping to this movie. Expertly and intricately plotted, and yet presented in a logical, coherent way the audience can follow, this film is a must see for any fan of Billy Wilder productions and the art and drama of cinema."
Double Indemnity (1944),Quintessential Film Noir,"I dropped a star since there are dated aspects to the movie that modern audiences may not appreciate. Specifically, the ability for love at first sight. The story is of a top notch insurance salesman who gets roped into a murder plot against the woman's husband. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a slick guy but still can't resist the sultry nature of Phyillis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She is spunky and quick witted and reels in men due to her roller coaster behavior. Loving at first, but runs cold when she doesn't get what she wants. So she uses the insurance savvy Walter to devise a plot to kill her husband, make it look like an accident and then collect on the insurance. What starts off as a plot to gain money becomes a more sexier topic. Do bad people fall in love? Yep. The tables get turned in a film noir. Femme fatale spins a web for the poor dumb schlub to fall into. But in this case, something deeper goes on between them. She realizes he's a skilled manipulator. And the thought of doing away with someone as cold to a person so lacking of empathy spins the tables. This is the fun that director Billy Wilder (my favorite director of all time) has with this flick. It becomes even better when Edward G. Robinson enters. He is Neff's direct manager and he has studied his insurance craft. He crunches numbers and lives at the office. He is also such a close friend to Neff that he never sees the evil within him. The joy of Wilder is that he already tells you the outcome. And then we get the narration through a dictaphone which is the confession. If you are planning to make a film noir...look no further for classic references than this one. It is incredible plotting."
Double Indemnity (1944),"""Murder can sometimes smell like honeysuckle.""","Los Angeles, July 16, 1938. ""I don't like the word confession..."" - Walter Neff A good story that unfolds as a flashback with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwick, and Edward G. Robinson. Screenplay by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler from the novel by James M. Cain. Do not want to go into the details of the movie as that is where the fun is. What can go wrong? Do not panic. I can say that the love sorry in the movie is between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes from the beginning to the end. Many movies and books are written for their mystery. Others focus on time and place. It is the time and place that fascinated me just as much as the story. Los Angles Railway Corp. I rode both the Red Cars and the Green Cars before they were dumped in the ocean. I even rode the electric buses that replaced the streetcars. They also showed Glendale. The Long Beach oil fields are mentioned (not Signal Hill.) Santa Monica, Palo Alto (a tad to the north), Olvera Street, and so on. There are a few technical faux pas, however they do not distract from the movie. It is worth watching several times to see how the details match the story."
Double Indemnity (1944),A Classic Film Noir That Still Radiates Energy,"Fred MacMurray is cast against type. Barbara Stanwyck makes good in a role she described to novelist James M. Cain as ""my favorite"" in a letter. Edward G. Robinson delivers the sharp dialogue co-written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler in an understated, yet deliberate, manner. Robinson drives the film with a performance that establishes his character as an insurance claims investigator with the eagle eye of a detective. He sparkles in scenes like the following: ""Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball. Only you fumbled on the goal line. Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty-yard loss. Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on."" Almost 80 years later, the noir genre simply does not get any better than Double Indemnity (1944)."
Double Indemnity (1944),One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen,"""Double Indemnity"" (1944), directed by Billy Wilder, is an undisputed classic of film noir that undoubtedly earns a perfect 10-star rating. This dark and gripping masterpiece is a shining example of the genre, showcasing exceptional storytelling, memorable performances, and unforgettable dialogue. The film's premise follows Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who becomes entangled in a sinister plot after meeting the seductive Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Together, they hatch a scheme to commit the perfect murder and fraudulently claim a double indemnity insurance policy. However, their plan spirals into a web of deception, betrayal, and moral decay. What sets ""Double Indemnity"" apart is its impeccable script, co-written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler. The film's sharp and cynical dialogue, delivered with finesse by the talented cast, contributes to its reputation as one of the finest examples of film noir. The banter between Walter and Phyllis is both seductive and chilling, setting the tone for the film's dark narrative. Fred MacMurray delivers a career-defining performance as Walter Neff, a character who evolves from an ordinary insurance salesman to a morally compromised and ultimately tragic figure. Barbara Stanwyck is equally impressive, exuding charisma and cold-blooded determination as Phyllis. Their on-screen chemistry is electrifying, making their morally ambiguous characters all the more fascinating. The film's direction by Billy Wilder is masterful, with noir cinematography that effectively uses shadows and lighting to create an atmosphere of tension and moral ambiguity. The voiceover narration, provided by Walter in a confession to his boss (Edward G. Robinson), adds a layer of suspense and introspection to the story. ""Double Indemnity"" delves deep into the themes of lust, greed, and the corrupting influence of crime. It presents a bleak and morally complex narrative that challenges the viewer's perceptions of right and wrong.

Double Indemnity (1944),8.5/10. Recommended,"This is a great movie. One can argue this is a masterpiece. A cinematic archetype of ""Man caught in an evil's woman's web without even realizing it"". It's unbelieavable how natural things seem to evolve/progress, resulting in a crime, that, by nature, is not ""natural"" at all. This is the definition of a trap that many people get caught, a trap made of envy, greed, lust, malice and deceit. Viewer cannot of course root for these characters but for sure these characters are magnetic and exciting. I don't know these actors. I think Barbara Stanwyck was very famous back in the day. In any case, they are excellent. Edward G. Robinson is ""primus inter pares"" though, oh, he is something else. So, if you want to watch one of the best crime/drama film noir movies of all time, watch this. Really high level of suspense, too many anxiety inducing moments."
Double Indemnity (1944),"This early and influential film noir is good, but it's not the best of the genre...","As is often the case, the reputation of something can be so great, that it becomes difficult in reality to meet the expectations such regard can create. Perhaps this was a factor that shaped my opinion about 'Double Indemnity', and I therefore should be mindful of that when judging this movie. I liked and enjoyed it, which my rating intends to convey. But there were a couple of aspects that slightly disappointed me as well. Modern viewers probably need to recognise and keep in mind, a couple of important contextual points regarding this movie. Firstly, its subject material, plot and characters - particularly the portrayal of a woman of questionable virtue - had become rare for an A-level feature film in the United States, after the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934. Secondly, its commercial success proved that the movie-going public had an appetite for the genre, encouraging the industry to create the numerous imitators which soon followed. One could draw a parallel that this movie did in 1944, what  Pulp Fiction (1994)  did fifty years later. They both pushed the boundaries of what was palatable subject material, introducing new edgy dialogue and interactions between the characters, creating a new kind of ""Cool"" for their respective eras. I was disappointed with Fred MacMurray's lead performance, but it should be noted that my opinion here is definitely in the minority. I felt his efforts weren't very natural, especially in his scenes with Barbara Stanwyck, who came across as more comfortable in her role. Edward G. Robinson was unsurprisingly brilliant, and of these three mentioned stood out the most. Most people will enjoy this movie, and plenty will go much further with their praise. I personally rate it a fair way short of the greatest films noir, but of course, that is a very high bar indeed."
Double Indemnity (1944),Quintessential Noir With a Few Notable Slow Spots,"In many ways, 'Double Indemnity' stands as the quintessential film noir. The crackling dialogue, a result of director Billy Wilder's collaboration with famed novelist Raymond Chandler, based on James Cain's pulp novel of the same name, coupled with the exceptional noirish cinematography by John Seitz, positions the film deservedly among the all-time great noirs of its era. However, I'm hesitant to award the film a perfect 10 out of 10 rating without addressing some deficiencies that slightly diminish its overall appeal. Undoubtedly, 'Double Indemnity' was a groundbreaking and highly controversial film for its time. Based on a murder that occurred in 1920s Queens, New York, the film delves into the sinister plot between a woman and her lover to murder the woman's husband for insurance money. Initially, the Production Code posed a challenge to the film's creation due to the salacious nature of the story. Even the film's star, Barbara Stanwyck, who portrayed the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, expressed reservations about embodying the role of an amoral killer. Certain critics might have preferred a more glamorous femme fatale, yet Stanwyck's more ""ordinary"" appearance is, in fact, perfect in capturing the intended note of banality when paired with co-star Fred MacMurray, who takes on the role of Walter Neff, an ""average"" insurance agent. However, the banality of their relationship becomes the narrative's Achilles heel. While chemistry occasionally surfaces through the aforementioned dynamic dialogue (notably Phyllis's clever allusion to exceeding the speed limit when Walter first makes sexual advances), the initial interactions between the two mainly revolve around the gradual acceptance of the notion of committing murder. This progression unfolds rather slowly, causing the suspense to truly heighten only when the actual murder transpires. Fortunately, the inclusion of Edward G. Robinson as Claims Investigator Barton Keyes injects a magnetic force into the film. Keyes, one of Robinson's most iconic roles, captivatingly portrays competence, especially in the memorable scene where he exposes a fraudulent insurance claim. The compellingly unique circumstances of the murder-where Walter impersonates the victim on a train-capture the audience's attention. Equally fascinating is Keyes's deduction that the death of Dietrichson (Tom Powers) was neither accidental nor a suicide, although he fails to connect Walter to the crime. Here, the subplot involving Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), who stands to inherit her father's estate, plays a role. Regrettably, much of the suspense involving Lola remains unseen on screen, a notable narrative weakness. As the plot advances, Walter's alliance with Phyllis takes a dramatic turn when he discovers her collusion with Nino Zachette (Byron Barr), Lola's on-and-off boyfriend, potentially for Lola's murder. The anticipated denouement sees Walter and Phyllis face their due consequences. However, I find Phyllis's sudden change of heart, leading her to spare her lover, slightly less convincing. In the realm of cinema, 'Double Indemnity' stands as one of the rare films where continuous narration effectively enhances the dialogue's imagery. The film's authenticity is bolstered by its adept incorporation of insightful references to the insurance industry, complementing Robinson's remarkably realistic performance."
Double Indemnity (1944),10/10,"I wonder what did the writers in the 40s had that contemporary writers lack. That's what runs in my mind every time I watch a classic. I'm not criticizing current writers (well who the hell am I to criticize anyone, anyway). It's just that notion you get when you watch something mind-blowing. How could something of more than 70 years old stay evergreen and amazing? As for Billy Wilder's works, I first watched Witness for Prosecution and had the same astonishing elation witnessing the brilliance of its time. I thought that's the case with any film that has been adapted from novel, but make one wrong move while converting a novel to film language, and you could infect the essence of the story. And, Billy Wilder was one of the many masters of the craft in his time. Opening a movie by revealing what is it about and make the viewers think what more could I expect now that I know the act, and disappointing them for being a smartass is one of the many character traits of masters, in my opinion. That's the way I felt with Kurosawa's High and Low as well. Films like these are just making me fall in love more and more with classics."
Double Indemnity (1944),"Yep, its great and timeless.","Watching ""Double Indemnity"" doesn't even feels like watching a movie from the 1940's era, because its a timeless piece of art that was great and age even better with time, telling a story about a crime almost perfect but not crime is perfect if there's a man willing to solve it. ""Double Indemnity"" doesn't just tell a story of a crime that was well plotted, but it also tell the story of the man who was plotting that crime, a man who wanted to challenge the system who he knew and worked in for 11 years, a man who was ready to challenge his co-worker and friend to see if he can outsmart him and come out victories. A man who put everything in the line for money and for the woman he loved with a simple murder against the husband of the woman he loved who did no wrong to him except having what he wanted for himself. The movie tell a story about a woman with no love in her heart who is welling to do whatever it takes to get what she wants, even if it means leaving many bodies behind her and using people for her gains and her gains only. It tell a story about a man who is used to deception and lying and yet this time it hurted him and he had a hard time solving a case because it was done by a close friend and a colleague who he trusts and share many things. ""Double Indemnity"" is a must watch for anyone who enjoys the film-noir movies, also recommend for anyone who is looking for a great movie."
The Third Man (1949),Still one of the best in the genre,"December 2023. Watching this 4k restauration confirms that this masterpiece has not aged a day. Just still speechless. The acting, the images and, indeed, the soundtrack are just perfect. Nothing to do with the version I saw in the fifties which was so truncated that it was hard to understand what was going on. Fortunately I saw it again in the Musée du Cinéma at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in a much better version. Then I really thought that it was a masterpiece. Watching it now confirms that I was not wrong at the time. Looks like I still need 40 characters to be eligible with this review. So I will finish with two words: Forever Outstanding."
The Third Man (1949),Beautifully filmed and flawlessly directed...,"I didn't quite love this movie as much as I hoped to, but my appreciation for the art and visuals is absolutely boundless. The feel of desperation in post-war Vienna is everywhere, the stunning B&W cinematography is flawless, and the acting is top shelf. I did find the pacing at times to be a little slow, and there wasn't the degree of suspense that I was hoping for, but neither of these detract from this Carol Reed / Graham Greene film noir masterpiece. Joseph Cotton is stellar as a hack American author turned sleuth, and Alida Valli shines as the love interest of Cotton's newly deceased friend, Harry Lime (played to perfection by Orson Welles). Since Welles was listed as a main star, we knew he had to turn up eventually... I thought it'd be in a series of flashbacks, but not so. The story is good, but this film should be seen and appreciated for the visuals and on-screen depiction of a post-war Europe at the onset of the Cold War. In this regard, it is unparalleled."
The Third Man (1949),The Viennese Child of German Expressionism,"Canted cameras galore and perhaps the best lighting cinema has ever been graced with. Every technique here seems to be in service of a filmic translation of the tumultuous state that post-WW2 Vienna underwent. This is sadly incorporated into the score, which ends up in laughable and even vexatious dissonance with the atmosphere, a brooding underworld accompanied by music that sounds not too dissimilar to Spongebob's theme. Despite my appreciation for this directorial aim, though, I found most of this slightly underwhelming in that department. Lots of quick cutting during regularly paced dialogue and no eagerness for blocking lengthier shots. Made me yearn for Welles in the director's seat, which is funny considering the film instantly gets better as soon as he shows up (his reveal is the best moment in it). Until that point, I found myself somewhat disinterested in the mystery plot that meanders a bit. Still, these are all blemishes on an otherwise gleaming surface that I hope to appreciate more when I take another (and closer) look at it."
The Third Man (1949),Orson Welles story in post war Vienna.,"A real classic, beautifully presented. Cinematography, music, story and cast were all pretty much perfect. In the story our protagonist (Joseph Cotten), a writer, travels to Vienna a city still recovering from the effects of the war, now divided into separate zones. Our protagonist has come to attend the funeral of his charismatic friend, who was seemingly killed in an accident. However something doesn't seem right and foul play it soon suspected. An alluring young woman is introduced (Alida Valli) who herself has secrets she wishes to keep. A web of lies and corruption begin to unravel and our hero must make a choice about how loyal he can remain to his old friend."
The Third Man (1949),One of the very best,"Combine a great story and direction with brilliant acting, perfect music and you get a fantastic film. But the cinematography and atmosphere take it to a whole different level. Any number of shots from the film could be used in an exhibition of B&W photography. The final scene and long shot is just perfect. Has to be in any serious film buffs top 5. It helps if you have read some Graham Green as it is a reflection on good and evil with two people who love someone who has turned out to be deeply flawed. But whom they still care for in their different ways. Deeply sad and gets me every time. And Ive watched it dozens of times."
The Third Man (1949),Carol Reed's best?,"The above headline is, as one would understand, no faint statement, when it comes to one of the all time greats in film history - and a personal favourite of mine. This film could very well be the best of his ever impressive filmography, however. It is an ever iconic and beautifully put together masterpiece, filled with stellar, suspenseful and ever great writing - incredible acting from some of the acting class legends, such as Orson Welles to name one. The cinematography, cutting and editing, truly in line with Carol Reed's great style, and always important in the noir genre. Beautiful and accompines the film gracefully. Overall, very much deserving of all the praise it has gotten, a stellar post-war film noir film, by a stellar director, and one every lover of film should watch, if you by odds have not seen it already!"
The Third Man (1949),Requires a lot of discussion,"(1949) The Third Man
THRILLER/ SUSPENSE/ CRIME DRAMA Co-produced and directed by Carol Reed, co-written and starring Orson Welles, that is the opposite to what most of what Hitchcock had done because of it's stance with the bad guy, in this case it's the Harry Lime character and a standout performance played by Orson Welles. Novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) visits war torn Berlin only to assume that his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) is dead only to discover that he is not quite dead yet, leaving him with so many questions and dilemmas! This film is best known for it's use of actual locales during the war, as well as the ending that may have reinvented endings in movie history."
The Third Man (1949),A tremendous post war mystery.,"The Third Man even now is a classic mystery, time has been very kind to this film. It moves by at an enjoyable pace, it gives an interesting look at a post war Vienna, and features some startlingly good visuals, Vienna is a stunning City, they make great use of it. It's a classic film noir, if you're a fan of the genre, the you'll very likely know this film, and probably enjoy it, it's very nearly up there with the likes of Double Indemnity and The Maltese Falcon, definitely of that ilk. Lots of twists and turns, you can't always believe what you're told... There's a lot of German spoken throughout, that helps to give it a very authentic feel, not something you'd see too often in English speaking movies. Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten and Alida Valli are all wonderful, every single player is a big character, there are no but party players here. Ardent fans of the Carry on films, will know full well that half of Carry on Spying came from any number of James Bond films, the other half came from this, right down to the catchy music. This film definitely has the rewatch factor, it just never gets old. Class! 9/10."
The Third Man (1949),"""Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?""","Extremely dialogue heavy for the first 30-40 mins, but luckily things become much more enthralling after that, and from there it isn't boring for a second. And that twist, oh my word! That immediately sparked excitement in me for the rest of the film. The writing is excellent of course, it's no wonder the likes of Martin Scorsese have waxed lyrical about it. This is my first time seeing an Orson Welles performance and he was subtly but strikingly captivating, and Ernst Deutsch deserves a shoutout as he was intriguingly most magnificent when he wasn't even saying a word. The small nuances in his facial expressions were remarkably perfect to show his true thoughts to the audience. To end on a small negative, I found the music choice very odd, as it didn't suit the tone of this tense, dramatic story one bit. As a result, the feature as a whole felt too unserious, despite the incredibly serious nature of the events unfolding. But overall a fantastic noir which I'd recommend not only to fans of this genre, but also to those who love a good mystery."
The Third Man (1949),Not a subversion - a gag,"I can't have been more underwhelmed by this film. I watched an ""explanation video"" which was all about the main role of geometry and angle, the alienation of the main character, the labyrinthine mystery the viewer ought to experience, and the control Harry Lime exerts from the shadows, until cornered. I found no aesthetic pleasure in the film, the anti-aestheticism emphasised by the purposely annoying soundtrack. I do find pure pleasure in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and do understand absurdism, profoundly enjoying Beckett. The Third Man read to me like a negation of everything, mainly plot and emotion. There's no reason a femme fatale would unconditionally embrace a detestable character. In terms of plot and dialogue basically nothing happens. Is this about a (no)man with no redeeming qualities, bound to lose everything except a beautiful woman, who would devote to him even postmortem?"
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Down These Mean Streets,"Dashiell Hammett was considered one of America's leading mystery writers. The New York Times even described him as ""the dean of the hard-boiled school of detective fiction"". But his stories have also had a significant impact on movies and TV shows, especially in the film noir genre. Hammett's most famous work was probably ""The Maltese Falcon"" from 1930. Here the public met the private detective Sam Spade for the first time. In him the world came across the archetype of the hard-drinking, hard-hitting, tough-talking gumshoe. In 1941 an odd group of people started filming ""The Maltese Falcon"". John Huston had never directed before, Humphrey Bogart only used to play heavies in supporting roles and for 61-year-old Sidney Greenstreet it was the first time he appeared in a feature what-so-ever. But the executives at Warner Brothers weren't worried. The studio regarded the production as a typical B-movie. A cheap detective flick to run out in some of the country's small, insignificant theaters. Despite the fact that many of the people involved were so new to the game, the production flowed along at a rapid pace. This was largely due to the fact that Huston had scripted every scene and camera angle before photography began. The whole thing actually went so smoothly that the cast and their director could take long, leisurely lunches at a Country Club next to the Warner studio in Burbank. When ""The Maltese Falcon"" was released the response was so positive that the film instantly acquired A-status. It was quickly moved to bigger and better theaters. The movie also made Huston a respected director - and turned Humphrey Bogart into a star. The only one unhappy was Dashiell Hammett. The writer had sold the rights to his novel for $8,500 but now discovered that the character of Sam Spade had been part of the bargain. Dashiell Hammett never earned another penny from the film rights to his most famous creation."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),"""Keep askin' for it and you're gonna to get it - plenty. I told you to shove off.""","FILM: 8.5/10. You know how everyone says remakes are terrible and Hollywood just recycles ideas nowadays? Well, folks, let me introduce you to John Huston's 1941 film The Maltese Falcon-the third adaptation of the same-name novel in a decade, and hands down, the best one. If you've always been skeptical of remakes, this film might make you reconsider. It's a cinematic gem that proves not all remakes are destined for mediocrity. Writing them off outright would mean missing out on this noir masterpiece. Set against the shadowy backdrop of film-noir, The Maltese Falcon is an early example of the genre's brilliance. Humphrey Bogart, known for his gangster roles, takes a departure and delivers a performance that's both gritty and nuanced. It's like seeing a familiar face in a new, captivating light. What struck me most is how the film unfolds its mystery. You don't even hear about the elusive falcon until well into the storyline. John Huston, who not only directed but co-wrote the script, pulls double duty with finesse. The result is a singular vision on screen that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The Maltese Falcon isn't just a remake; it's a reinvention that stands tall among its predecessors. So, the next time someone bemoans the state of Hollywood's obsession with remakes, throw this film into the conversation. It's a compelling argument that some remakes aren't just necessary-they're downright exceptional. FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray VIDEO: 9/10.

The Maltese Falcon (1941),Classic noir,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is a landmark 1941 film that still remains one of the best examples of the detective and noir genres. Director John Huston embodied on the screen a classic story about mystery, intrigue and romance, creating an atmosphere in which it is impossible not to get involved. One of the main reasons why ""The Maltese Falcon"" has become a real cinematic gem is the unsurpassed cast. Humphrey Bogart as detective Sam Spade, along with Mary Astor as his mysterious client Bridget O'Shaughnessy, create amazing chemistry on the screen. The performance deserves the highest praise - their acting is full of energy, intrigue and unpredictability. The script of ""The Falcon"" skillfully mixes elements of a classic detective film with comedy features and subtle hints of romance. The story of the search for a valuable falcon and the relationship between the characters seems simple, but it strikes with its unpredictability and the development of the plot. The dialogues are masterfully constructed and full of humor, which makes the film unique and memorable. The visual style of the painting deserves a special mention. Houston creates an atmosphere of complete mystery, riddled with riddles. The black-and-white image enhances the effect of noir cinema, adding icy aesthetics and mystery to each scene. Lighting harmoniously combines with the characters and the environment, creating a game of shadows and shades, and the camera skillfully conveys the emotions and mood of the characters. The musical accompaniment in the film sets the viewer to the right mood - jazz perfectly combines with the action on the screen, giving it dynamism and passion. The selected music creates the atmosphere of the era and subtly conveys the emotional state of the characters. One of the main advantages of ""The Maltese Falcon"" is its time. The film skillfully works with the plot, characters and aesthetics of the 1940s, literally setting the genre outlines of that time. This desire for authenticity and aesthetics creates the impression of immersion in the past and allows the viewer to better enjoy every aspect of the painting. ""The Maltese Falcon"" is certainly a memorable work that continues to be a milestone in cinema. An excellent combination of acting skills, an unforgettable script and visual style makes this film one of the most significant projects of its time. 7 out of 10."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Amazing Bogart,"Most reviewers seem to want to point out mainly that Bogart shines in this movie, but I'm almost afraid that that would not give some of the supporting cast enough credit. Peter Lorre was a familiar face for me, having showed up in Fritz Lang's M before, and plays a great mischievous, almost fairy-like counterpart to the Fat Man, Kasper Gutman. Gutman very confidently plays a villain in control, which makes the story more compelling and exciting. Granted, the female supporting roles do seem a slight bit too dramatic and stiff in their performance at times. Sam Spade's secretary might be the most charming in this group. Directing and cinematography is gorgeous, but the plot is, even though intriguing, lacking a bit in the end. Overall, it's not just Bogart that makes this film worth watching, but one could wonder how well it would've survived in people's minds over half a century if it would have had a different actor playing Sam Spade."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),At least Bogart's great here.,"I've watched three John Huston movies lately, but none because they were John Huston movies necessarily. He's a director who made a range of films, and many of them are admirable... but I also find many of them kind of dry and boring in parts (Treasure of the Sierra Madre is maybe the only one I don't find slow in parts, for what that's worth). The Maltese Falcon followed Casablanca at the double feature I saw tonight, and Casablanca is so much sharper from a writing perspective, and much better paced. The Maltese Falcon really drags in parts, and I felt restless watching it to some extent. It's all about various people wanting the titular object, and I don't know - it really drags things out to some extent, and while I don't think it's visually flawed, nothing about the way it looks was consistently super exciting to me. That they got a feature-length film out of such a straightforward premise might be worth something, but the thing that does thankfully save The Maltese Falcon is the acting. Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre (both were also in Casablanca) are good, but it's Bogart (also of course in Casablanca) who's amazing here, and considerably elevates something I'd otherwise consider pretty dry. I think besides the acting, The Maltese Falcon is fair for its day, and overall not terrible, but just not one I really connect with all that much. I pretty much felt the same way back when I watched this during high school, while we were studying the film noir genre."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),8/10. Recommended,"Not much to say. Another great 40's movie, for sure they they don't make them like they used to. Classy, stylish, clever, intense and exciting. The most well received review here mentions that ""Many film historians consider this as the very first noir film"". That by itself should make any cinema fan eager to watch it. However, the recommendation is not for historical reasons and only. FALCON remains an amazing movie, interesting at worst, i mean, even if you don't love it, you won't get bored for a second. It's not the best 40's movie i've watched (NOTORIOUS and CASABLANCA are superior movies), it's definitely a bit outdated but its flaws are not even worth mentioning."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Iconic John Huston,"John Huston is without a doubt one of the standouts in the so-proclaimed ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood, providing a vast number of incredible dramas and thrillers, crime films. This thriller is certainly one of the more infamous classics, and for good reason. The script is ever incredible, the pacing and writing very sharp and even. The actors, all of them great icons of course, all do an incredible job. Truly some of the best in their careers. The cinematography, cutting and editing is, as per usual with Huston, incredible. Very beautifully put together overall. Very much an incredible film, that is highly recommended for any lover of film, if you by odds have not seen it already!"
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Beginning with a ripper of a noir,"John Huston starts his directing career proper by creating a movie star in Humphrey Bogart. Bogart had been a supporting actor for WB for a few years (notably in things like Wyler's Dead End), but his turn as Sam Spade in the adaptation of the novel by Dashiell Hammett done by Huston himself put him on the cinematic map. And watching the film eight decades after its release (for the third or fourth time, to be honest), it's easy to see how he could capture the audience's attention in this sarcastic performance that glides through danger with ease. Throw in the mystery of a plot, and you've got a recipe for audience enjoyment. Sam Spade (Bogart) runs a private detective business with his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) when a woman under a false name (Mary Astor) comes in and asks them to track the man who has her sister. It turns out that this woman, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, was lying about her reasons for following Floyd Thursby, and Sam finds out that night when both Miles and Thursby are murdered on the street half an hour apart. So begins Spade's search through a seedy underbelly of antique collection where no one says what they mean, and he has to sort through it all to find the truth, despite the unhelpful efforts of the police who want to lock him up for the murders. With the help of his secretary Iva (Gladys George), Sam stays one step ahead as best he can, especially when Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) sticks him up to find information about some mysterious black bird figurine, starting Sam on the path to find Mr. Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) who is also after it. The joys of the film are in the combination of the tricksy nature of the plot and Spade's cool approach to unraveling what he got dropped in the middle of. I think part of the appeal is that Spade is simply not emotionally connected to anyone or the Maltese Falcon itself. We get a nice rundown of the history from Mr. Gutman, and Spade just listens blithely like he doesn't really care. He's constantly acting invested one moment, pretending rage or investment, but then going back to being smug and almost entertained by what he sees and hears. It's all ridiculous, and Bogart plays Sam like a detached member of the audience to a certain degree. The film was obviously made on the cheap with almost half of the film and most of the final half hour taking place on a single set: Sam's apartment, but Huston makes the most of his camera, obviously having learned from Wyler on how to make his compositions interesting even in limited space. This especially becomes important in the final twenty-minutes or so where five people are in the living room of an apartment for almost the whole time, and Huston can pan his camera from left to right, getting all five into frame at different distances. It's not as complex or effortlessly accomplished as Wyler would have done it, but it is, nonetheless, well done. My only real issue with the film is that despite all of Spade's apparent detachment from all of the events in the film, there's this last-minute need for him to be invested in Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. There are tears as he makes his terrible decision to invite justice upon her for her crimes, and I just don't think it follows from what we learned about from Sam Spade up to that point. There's a nice reveal about his motive for getting deep into it, regarding what one does when one loses a partner, but I never felt much that Spade was actually falling for the woman. He was toying with her as much as he had been toying with Cairo or Gutman or slapping around Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.), Gutman's right hand man, because he could and it entertained him while it got him closer to figuring out the answers at the center of the mystery. And that the mystery ends without a real conclusion, essentially Spade just closing one chapter in a larger adventure while talking about the Falcon being the stuff that dreams are made of is just kind of wonderful. That he's removed from the mystery because he doesn't actually care about the falcon provides this kind of distance to the manic behavior of the people he's dealing with that creates a better sense of fun in the tale. Huston entered the WB system as director in the early 40s, made a very fun and accomplished entry in their house style while applying the filmmaking lessons he'd learned from Wyler and keeping Hammett's storytelling intact. He bred a new movie star in the process and got his own directing career into a great opening state. The Maltese Falcon is a very good first film, and a fun movie in its own right."
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Attack of the Raptors...,"Sam Spade and Miles Archer are detectives, the private type who you can give directives, after meeting with a dame, there then begins a deadly game, with a group who seem to have, their own perspectives; although they all have as their goal a missing falcon, and soon there are some folks, who find their souls gone, as beneath the dark veneer, there are those quite insincere, as you'll find after a number of liaisons; as the story ratchets up the threads combine, and at the centre of the plot's a large waistline, that speaks with eloquence and intent, as deep within, passions ferment, in a film that is a classic of its time. Great cast, great story, great film - but isn't Sydney Greenstreet outstanding!"
The Maltese Falcon (1941),Great but not perfect,"The Maltese Falcon is a great film, it was one of the very first noirs, a unique genre that defined the next two decades in cinema, it first introduced a delightful Humphrey Bogart who'd become a worldwide icon, it deployed spectacular camera and light work and it deserves a spot in the list of films that shaped cinema as we know it today. However, the actual product that we have on our hands leaves much to be desired. In my humble opinion, pacing in this film is far from perfect. It starts at a reasonable speed, we get to know the main characters, their intentions and the overall plot starts to unfold itself. But as we go deeper into the second act, the pace ramps up, to the point that keeping up with the story becomes a headache. This is a film that most people with focus deficiency will lose interest in, finding themselves not caring about what is going on. Still, this film earns a watch for its technical marvels and for Bogey's acting masterclass. I just wish that it was longer or the plot was less disorganized."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Laughton should have directed more,"Charles Laughton's sole work as director is an accomplished, beautifully made, impeccably acted, and perhaps a bit too thin thriller, the announcement of a new talent behind the camera. And the reaction was muted contemporaneously. It was either the negative critical reaction or Laughton's simple preference for directing theater over film, but The Night of the Hunter marked the sole, enticing work behind the camera of Laughton who could have gone on to make several more films, giving us a legacy in film of him beyond his performances in films like Witness for the Prosecution. As it stands, though, if you are going to have only one movie to your name, you could do far, far worse than The Night of the Hunter. The story follows the deranged preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who goes from town to town, killing women because he considers the frilly and lacey nature of modern women to be a blight upon God's creation. He's thrown in jail for stealing a car at the same time that Ben Harper (Peter Graves) is thrown in prison with a death sentence for killing two people while stealing $10,000 that he hid with his children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), without the knowledge of their mother Willa (Shelley Winters) because she's too trusting. Harry gets a hint of the money's location through Ben's sleep-talking, realizing that the children know. Harry becomes monomaniacal in the pursuit of the money, finding the newly widowed woman, playing up his charm, and marrying her in quick time, all while Pearl falls in love with him and John mistrusts him. The meat of the film is all about danger, this deranged preacher man using his outward position as both a man of God and the new father to these children to commit and threaten violence in pursuit of the universal MacGuffin: a handful of cash. That sense of danger is palpable because of how in control Laughton was in terms of every aspect of the production. Firstly are the performances. The standout showstopper is Mitchum who balances between charming and viciously dangerous with ease. Considering the supposedly true stories of his deep drunkenness the deeper into production he got, that's kind of amazing and a testament to Mitchem as well as Laughton. The supporting cast has their own great moments as well, the early parts dominated by Winters' combination of wounded, expectant, and pious that makes her sympathetic and pathetic all at once, the exact sort of woman who would fall for a slick operator like Powell. That latter half is dominated by the silent film star Lillian Gish who appears as a kindly old woman who takes in wayward children cast out during the Depression, who adds John and Pearl to her brood after the two escape from Powell's murderous ways. Where the film works surprisingly well (only because Laughton was an actor, really) is how gorgeous the film looks from beginning to end. It's rarely realistic, those moments relegated to scenes outside during the day, and there's a heavy use of shadow from the DP Stanley Cortez that takes a full step into German Expressionism, especially the moment that Powell reveals his true nature to Willa, complete with exaggerated arm movements. The action moves outside after Powell becomes too big of a threat, and the river gets filmed on a sound stage primarily at night, creating that artistic look of night where every major figure in the distance is backlit by some major source of light, causing outlines in the dark rather than needing to rely on heavily filtered brightly lit scenes. I suppose one reason I'm held back in appreciation slightly is that good wins. It doesn't feel right for the story, especially after Powell escapes from a lynch mob and disappears from the story completely. There's a happy note at the end, unalloyed by any other emotion, and it doesn't quite seem to fit the rest of the film. The book ends definitively with Powell dying at the hands of the lynch mob, but the movie has him get away, and then we have a happy ending. It just doesn't quite fit. Plus, there doesn't seem to be much of a point by the end except the thrills of the chase we've had, and when we have this happy ending, it seems incongruous with what came before. Still, that's a minor concern. It's a beautifully shot, well-acted, and thrilling ride through the American midwestern countryside. That it was poorly received at the time is not the biggest of surprises. It's all about children in danger and is overwhelmingly meanspirited for much of its runtime, but it's also such a good thrill ride as it goes. I do wish Laughton had directed more. He showed real promise."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Stark and memorable movie.,"The preacher, a man of charm, conviction and a commanding fiery presence arrives in a quiet troubled town. There's one problem though, he's crazy...
The film is packed full of tension, I would say though that the children are unrealistically adult and rational. The film has a lovely soundtrack, great black and white cinematography. The main character has an almost pathologically violent reaction to any signs of female sexuality. The story is almost like King Herold and the lost children. It also plays tribute to older forms of cinema. The films is very memorable and won't be to everyone's taste but I thought it was pretty terrific."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Finally saw this movie on the big screen,"I have seen this movie on DVD and finally got to see it in theaters tonight. This is a perfect movie. The acting, the visuals, the emotions that it pulls. Everyone needs to see this. This was the only movie the director ever made, well he could never top this. It's such a beautiful movie to watch, and it pulls all the emotions. It is terrifying, it is sad, and it truly makes you feel love at the end. Lillian Gish is perfect. Robert Mitchum is not only terrifying, but you can understand the feels of one of the characters at the end *he is sexy as hell*. The river seen will make you cry from the beauty."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Chiseled diamond of dark poetry,"One of the most iconic and atmospheric film of the movie history, a masterpiece directed by an only one film movie maker, and also UNIQUE actor: Charles Laughton. Best iconic Robert Miitchum's performance, and his favourite movie with himself. A mix-up of poetry and darkness, absolutely stunning images, camera work, angles, a jaw dropping aesthetic performance, and I don't even speak of the best Robert Mitchum's performance ever. He will repeat more or less the same character thirteen years later in Henry Hathaway's FIVE CARDS STUD. Lilian Gish is also outstanding in this brave and dedicated old lady taking care of children. That's just a shame that director Laughton died so early without having the possibility to give us another gem of his as a film maker."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),"A Chilling, Masterful Noirish Thriller","A taut, gripping, and disturbing noirish thriller that has lost none of its power and resonance. As concerned with power, manipulation and control - especially but not exclusively of the religious variety - as it is with the maguffin of the money, it sings with technical excellence, vivid symbolism, and haunting imagery. Mitchum is terrific, but it's the children who really shine; the cinematography draws many memorable and unsettling images, and the pastoral setting is used to evoke some disturbing, worrying parallels. Timeless and masterful, it's hard to forget. What the director might have gone one to accomplish is one of cinema's great unanswered questions."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),A film that with a love/hate ethos that was hated but now has gained more love!,"The plot is very simple but effective. A con-man, posing as a preacher tries to get his hands on $10000 stolen from a bank and hidden by the perpetrator in his daughter's doll, something the Preacher at first doesn't know about. The cast performance most notably by Robert Mitchum as the deranged preacher is a highlight of the film. One minute he is menacing in his quest for the money ($10000 was a hell of a lot of money in Depression era America when this film is set) and the next quite comical as a supposed Preacher talking to God and preaching to townsfolk. The photograpjhy is a highlight of the film and deserves some mention. It has some German expressionism tones that reminded me of 1920's silent cinema with its shadows, shapes and style. First time director Charles Laughton was ahead of his time using techniques from behind the times somewhat! So it was with some tragedy that this was his first and only film as director after this film had a disappointing financial and critical reveption on release back in 1955 and has only gained a healthy respect including IMDB score today. He could and should have furthered his career as director. Influences on modern cinema works I can recollect are notable including the Coen brothers in several of their films including their version of True Grit (2010) and in particular I thought of No Country For Old Men (2007) where a similar odd character chases the money (Javier Bardem)."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Strange but strangely compelling,"The 'Reverend' Harry Powell (Robert Mitcham), a serial killer posing as a 'fire'n'brimstone' preacher, tries to con, then force, the children of Ben Harper (Peter Graves), his recently executed cell-mate into revealing where the cash from a bank heist is hidden. Charles Laughton's only directorial effort is full of offbeat characters, unsettling music, near-surreal cubist imagery, and poetically expressionistic scenes (notably Willa Harper's (an unusually restrained Shelly Winters) final scene in the river). Mitcham is quite good as the creepy black-clad 'hunter', a bit stagy and over-the-top at times, but that is not unexpected for a character playing a character. The actors playing John and Pearl, the Harper young'uns (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are also quite good as are veterans Lillian Gish, the elderly lady who takes the children under her wing and promptly sees through Powell's phoney preacher shtick, and Evelyn Varden, the elderly self-righteous busybody who doesn't. Much of the film was shot on soundstages and Laughton plays with the artificiality of the sets and the lighting to give his film dream-like vibe (the intent to look a bit 'unreal' could explain some of the minors 'errors' noted in the IMDB goofs section). The Night of the Hunter was a unique fusion (for the 1950s) of aesthetics and genres that was a failure with contemporaneous audiences and critics but has since been recognised as a well-crafted piece of 'art-noir'."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),Mitchum's Best (and Scariest) Performance,"Awesome; concise; influential. Basically, a woman-hating preacher learns of a pair of kids who know the secret location of stolen money, seduces their mother, and terrorizes the children. This movie is fast-paced; it doesn't waste a second on worthless plot points, or slow scenes. The actors are pretty good across the board; some of them were duds, but Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish were both at the top of their game. The score itself wasn't anything special, but the use of biblical hymns throughout was well done by Laughton. I liked the theme of this movie (the corrupted religious evil) as well as the slightly-unpredictable ending and pacing which still managed to stay fast. I especially liked the german-expressionism-inspired camera-angles, scenes, and makeup. Overall, one of the best film-noirs I've seen, and worthy of the horror genre too."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),I'm the Only Person Who Hated This Movie,"I watched this movie with a group of cinema buffs - they absolutely loved it and I thought it was terrible. I feel like we were watching completely different movies! Mitchum was just a shallow caricature of a villain and Shelly Winters' character ark makes no sense. The plot was disjointed and strange. Again, lots of flat shallow caricatures and little strong acting. Honestly, the kids were the better actors. The final act with Ms Cooper made no sense, though I understand her as the good counterpart to Howell's evil. This movie was a box office flop and I can totally relate I simply do not understand why modern audiences laud it."
The Night of the Hunter (1955),"""It's a hard world for little things""","There are many films I still remember as classics even though I last watched them very long ago. Upon rewatching Night of the Hunter, it's easy to say it feels just as thrilling and creepy as it did when I first saw it. While not a horror movie, it makes sense to consider it as one seeing as how the antagonist is so brilliantly portrayed as a genuine psychopath. The story in this takes place in West Virginia during the Depression. Two kids, John and Pearl (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce respectively) are approached by their criminal father Ben (who has just committed a robbery) and told never to tell anyone where he hid the money he stole. Immediately after, he is cuffed and taken away to be hanged. Before his execution, his cellmate is a preacher named Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who tries his hardest to get Ben to give up his secret, but the secret dies with him. Powell was in jail for stealing a car. When he gets out, he goes to Ben's town and catches everyone's attention because he appears to be an honest man of God at first glance, and he also acts the part. Ben's widow, Willa is soon the target of his affection, and she and Powell soon marry. Pearl is naive and doesn't seem to mind, but John's instinct tells him this guy is not to be trusted and he'll never replace his real father. Powell guilt trips Willa into going to religious gatherings with him, believing her only purpose in the eyes of the Lord is to take care of John and Pearl. One night, she comes home late and Powell is caught red handed threatening Pearl about the missing money. Powell realizes Willa is now a liability and must be silenced. He stabs her to death in her bed and sinks an old car into a lake with her corpse in it. Powell comes across John and Pearl and threatens to kill John if he doesn't say where the money is. Pearl finally confesses it's in her doll, which is the truth, but before Powell can do anything, John causes shelves to collapse on his head in the basement. They barely manage to get away by using a small boat to paddle to safety up a river. John and his sister eventually arrive at a house owned by Rachel (Lillian Gish), an affectionate but stern elderly woman who takes care of orphans. Powell manages to find Rachel's house and tries to persuade her that he is the father of John and Pearl, but she isn't fooled and sticks a shotgun in his face. He promises he'll be back. Once night falls, Powell returns and threatens Rachel to give up the kids, so she shoots him. He limps into the barn where he is later apprehended. During his arrest, John is reminded of the pain his father went through while being handcuffed, so he gives up the money to Powell. In court, John can't bring himself to say Powell is guilty, but he will still be executed sometime soon. Back at Rachel's house, John, Pearl and the other children open Christmas gifts. With this legendary movie, Charles Laughton shows that he wasn't just a top of the line actor, but a nearly perfect director too. Sadly, in one of the most baffling anecdotes I can think of off the top of my head, the initial reaction to Night of the Hunter was quite bad. Because of this, Laughton never again directed an actual film. Sometimes, I really do have no faith in humanity. Thank god public opinion has shifted in favor of this film, because there are so many different reasons to praise it. Being a noir, it has a lot of dark shadows and reminds me a lot of Grapes of Wrath. The fact they both take place in the 30s I feel is no coincidence. The music is quite disturbing and really contributes a lot to the moments where Powell is trying to chase after the kids. No matter how slow he moves he always seems to catch up with them. Speaking of whom, Robert Mitchum puts on one of the most defining performances of his whole career here. He's still in a noir, so it's not out of place for him, but even when playing a southerner he does so extremely well. He's one of the most downright evil characters in a noir just because he's perfectly willing to kill children to get what he wants. Silent film legend Lillian Gish also portrays a woman who is determined to stand up for what she thinks is right and does so with much tenacity. It is odd seeing her in a non-silent movie though. The movie is made more convincing by the fact that the main characters are two small children who haven't done anything wrong. It's not their fault their father was a criminal, but because of his choices, they enter a nightmare. In my view, Mitchum's performance makes this movie what it is, but there are tons of other reasons why I consider Night of the Hunter one of my favorite noirs."
Rebecca (1940),An exceptional film.,"A really superb romantic thriller released in 1940. The film shot in black and white and in a 4:3 aspect ratio still looks gorgeous and really is one you can't take your eyes off. I think this might be my favourite British film of all time. It's also I think arguably the greatest love story on film, with Brief Encounter the only other option. The film deserves so much praise for the set design, the excellent script, Lawrence Olivier is brilliant as a lonely troubled widower when we first meet him, rich, aristocratic yet sorrowful and distant it's all there in the performance, the way he carries himself, it's sublime. The costumes all look extremely pleasing yet also modern and real, the film also takes you back to a day of manners and a strict social class system where the rich might spend there days at Monte Carlo while a keen sense of hierarchy is preserved back in there stately homes. You really feel and care for our main character, superbly played by Joan Fontaine who seems so earnest, insecure and caring yet so full of self doubt too and so often made to feel inadequate by those around her, either deliberately or accidently. The film constantly raises the question of who's in charge, one character seems to not so much ask as tell her what will happen next around the house. The film makes great use of light and shadow to hint at the mystery in the story and the internal conflict within the character. The beautiful house at times feel overwhelmingly large and intimidating and at times empty. The film later turns into more a crime thriller with great tension between the characters who also have great conflict within themselves, there's just so much happening in every scene. Big twists come, the characters become more morally grey but also more interesting, our new young wife assumes a stronger more protective personality while another charming but slightly threating man appears on the scene and is given all the best lines. Secrets are revealed but then struggled to conceal leading to greater tension yet. A scene involving a huge fire also looks magnificent near the end. The acting, cinematography and story cannot be praised enough. Both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are incredible in this movie, playing two of the greatest characters I've seen on screen. I finally get what all they hype was about with Olivier."
Rebecca (1940),8.1/10. Recommended,"I started my Hitchcock journey recently, i have no words to describe his genius. For reference, my ratings are: NOTORIOUS 9/10 VERTIGO 8,9/10. ROPE: 8,2/10. DIAL M FOR MURDER: 8,6/10. THE 39 STEPS : 7,3/10. REAR WINDOW : 8,4/10. THE BIRDS: 7,7/10 MARNIE: 7,2/10. SPELLBOUND : 7,6/10. STRANGERS ON A TRAIN : 7,2/10. LIFEBOAT : 7,4/10. NORTH BY NORTHWEST: 8/10. One of the best Hitchcock movies. Of course, it helps a lot that the story is based upon the work of acclaimed novelist, Daphne Du Maurier. Even the best directors need desperately a good story in order for their movie to be great, they are not magicians to pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even Hitchcock himself has created some not so memorable movies because script didn't help him. It's not just Du Maurier. Acting is always one of the best qualities in Hitchcock movies but acting here is even better than the average of them. Laurence Olivier's acting is transcendental, dare i say, mythical. Fontaine is also excellent, and truth be told, her role is even more demanding, not so ""glamorous"", more introvert and subtle : These roles are always harder than a loud character who screams and yells, displaying his rough emotions. In conclusion, this is a great drama/mystery movie, a bit less suspensful than his other best movies, but amongst his most well-written movies with really unexpected twists and turns. Last 40 minutes are amazing. I didn't love this movie until then, and that's the reason i didn't rate it higher. In any case, these last 40 minutes make this movie (almost) a masterpiece."
Rebecca (1940),When woman loves a man,"I watched this movie long ago but I remember very well Joan Fontaine. She was really excellent actress playing ""white"" role in all of her movies I watched (black&white movies). In this movie she is trying with love to soften character of the man who is under his face trying to hide dramatical relationship with his past. Simply she is trying to heal his heart. She is fighting with ghosts of the past all over the place. Good heart and love are only weapons she is using to save him. It's easy to be a bad person. She was acting a good person and that is a pretty difficult task. I will always remember gentle look and her eyes full of love."
Rebecca (1940),Dark Delights and Hidden Desires,"Rebecca is a captivating tale of romance set against the backdrop of a haunting mystery, reminiscent of a Cinderella story with a twist. The narrative begins with the aspirations of an ordinary woman who dreams of the grandeur of the opulent Manderley since her childhood. Fate intervenes when she is swiftly proposed to by the master of Manderley. As she enters the splendid Manderley, I can't help drawing parallels to the gothic setting of Jane Eyre: Both works feature young, isolated heroines entering mysterious estates dominated by enigmatic male figures, dark secrets and repressed emotions. And their romances begin... The initial happiness of blossoming love and bright prospects quickly transforms into a sinister nightmare as she realizes that her marriage is far from what she anticipated. The life at Manderley is shrouded in gloom, darkness and haunting memories. The very walls of the magnificent mansion seem to echo the presence of her husband's deceased first wife, the perfect Rebecca. The story unfolds as secrets about a heinous crime are unveiled, leading to a tumultuous climax that will determine the fates of the main characters... As far as I can tell without spoiling its twist ending, this old film retains enough suspense and tension to captivate even those accustomed to modern mysteries, like myself."
Rebecca (1940),Rebecca,Joan Fontaine gives quite a performance as the unnamed main character. She captures self awareness very well. She marries Laurence Olivier and moves to his mansion and she is permanently reminded of his widow Rebecca. The housekeeper is also a good character. The film is eerie and is very good for me up to the point where you find out what really happened to Rebecca and then i just feel everything is rushed. Hitchcock's first American made film is extremely British. This is probably where he starts to get into his stride. Joan Fontaine gives quite a performance as the unnamed main character.

Rebecca (1940),Hitchcock's Creation,"The films of Alfred Hitchcock and decades after the master's departure are remembered for their unique atmosphere. Sometimes his style is elusive in a particular scene, more often it excites when the viewer sees that memorable suspense and tension. ""Rebecca"" is a project a little unusual for the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Although all the recognizable aspects of the director are present here, the detective and the love line come to the fore. And this is undoubtedly a successful approach to the presentation of this particular work. I remember the picture and the variety of beautiful plans. The team of creators did a great job on the scenery, presenting the rather detailed rooms of the mansion to the audience. But the main characters in the film, of course, are the characters played by Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. Moreover, in my opinion, Olivier acts as a ""second fiddle"". The main decoration of the painting is Fontaine, her game pleases and fascinates. The heroine looks both strong and lost, puzzled, and sometimes afraid of what is happening. The whole range of acting skills of the actress allows you to feel how complex her heroine is. I am sure that other contenders for this role, among whom, by the way, were the stars of the recent ""Gone with the Wind"" Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, would hardly be able to convey the image of the heroine, which was so successfully embodied by Fontaine. Olivier is also good. The Englishman very subtly conveyed the aristocratic image of his hero, who has all the recognizable features of such persons. His hero is confident, determined, and of course it is his story that becomes something to be explored by both the heroine of the film and the audience. The acting work of all the other participants in this project is also good. I wouldn't single out anyone in particular, everyone coped perfectly. Hitchcock, as a masterful director, perfectly staged the picture, playing on the feelings of the audience and skillfully presenting this or that scene exactly as he knows how. The picture became the best at the Oscar ceremony in the corresponding year, taking the coveted statuette. The second award, which the creators could boast of, was the best work of the operator. ""Rebecca"" is a worthy film of its time. Often the picture is forgotten because of the more famous works of the master of suspense, including the legendary ""Psycho"", ""Birds"", ""Window to the courtyard"" or ""In case of murder, dial ""M"". However, this is a high-quality project that will still be interesting today with its unforgettable atmosphere of detective and drama. The authors elegantly conveyed a mysterious story that is literally imbued with the intangible, but very distinct and even dangerous presence of the one called Rebecca. 7 out of 10."
Rebecca (1940),Rebecca review,"Rebecca represents a major turning point in Alfred Hitchcock's career. It was his first American-made film, allowing him to capitalize on the hopes and dreams of working with a bigger budget and more equipment, furthering the masterful technical control so central to his style. Looming large over the entire picture is the involvement of that sleepless memo maniac David O. Selznick. With Gone with the Wind inching towards release, he moved forward on an adaptation, or as he put it 'picturization', of Daphne du Maurier's much-loved classic Rebecca. Selznick was as intrusive as a producer gets, managing to stay on top of the production even through the Gone with the Wind preparation which took up almost all of his time. It is easy to under-appreciate what Selznick contributed to Rebecca, even though Hitchcock purists may see the final product as damaged goods. This new Blu-Ray reminds us of the singular combination of Selznick's prestige, Hitchcock's recurring themes and embedded psychology and du Maurier's sumptuously enticing exploration of the Gothic. Revisiting the film, in more pristine shape than ever before, allows us to take in Rebecca in all its glory, and even its limitations. Selznick had an unrelenting sense of grandeur and a lavishness with which he strove to do justice to a book he near-worshiped. This comes to serve Rebecca well, most prominently with Manderlay. The mansion is so imposing in its physical representation of the suffocating spirit of the deceased Rebecca that it becomes a central character. The first Mrs. De Winter and Selznick are united in their paralleled enduring influence that seeps into every scene. As contradictory as Hitchcock and Selznick's agendas seem, they inadvertently coalesce to create something mostly harmonious. As far as Hitchcock goes, he also had a strong connection to the book, wanting to buy the rights earlier but not having the money to do so. Here, he gets to astonish with his lusciously multi-layered compositions. The lighting in particular is something to behold, alone begging repeat viewings with its majesty. The mogul's insistence on a conventionally faithful adaptation provides a basis for Hitchcock to wield his inquiring camera into what is going on underneath it all. Selznick's top-of-the-line template doesn't hurt either. He pokes and pries, peeling back the layers as Joan Fontaine treks into the nightmare world of Manderlay. Again, Rebecca solidifies Hitchcock's unmatched control, all the more impressive for working on a production as big as this. The performances remain a varied bunch, from Laurence Olivier's constantly brooding and callous Maxim to the ever-reliable character actors Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Florence Bates. Joan Fontaine is aware of herself every moment in her first starring role and Hitchcock uses that to showcase the character's vulnerability and at times frustrating naiveté. She is a fragile stranger in a strange land, both on and off screen, and it appropriately looks like she could crumble any minute. All apprehensive eyebrows and second-guessing, Fontaine shines because she natural exudes a quality that she herself seems unaware of. It is of course Judith Anderson whose performance has more than held up over the decades. Her Mrs. Danvers is one of mostly passive and increasingly apparent insanity. She exists entirely in her own world, a heightened past broken up with patches of lucid denial and resentment. Anderson's spacy passion makes for a justifiably iconic villain. There is the moment when Rebecca realizes that Mrs. Danvers is not completely sane. The camera stays with the horrified unnamed protagonist as she moves away to deal with said realization, leaving Mrs. Danvers in the background, carrying on in her own world. That scene and moment express all, remaining as creepy as ever. The final twenty minutes is largely where Rebecca falters. We see the baggage lifted between Maxim and our The Second Mrs. De Winter, and they are allowed to connect freely, banding together against Rebecca's hold on posthumous hold on them. This is all well and fine, but at this point the story itself becomes laborious. Hitchcock can only do so much to alleviate the shortcomings found here. Thankfully, George Sanders' slimy presence is always a welcome treat. The extras on Rebecca carry over from a previous DVD edition and are more than satisfying in their abundant quantity, largely supporting a contextual view of the film via the Hitchcock and Selznick collaboration. Richard Schickel's commentary is pretty basic and his views of the film appear to be largely lukewarm. 'The Making of Rebecca' and 'The Gothic World of Daphne du Maurier' further expand on adding contextualization. Also included are radio plays of the story, an isolated music and effects track, interviews with Hitchcock and, my personal favorite, original screen tests with Margaret Sullavan and Vivien Leigh. Rebecca may not be a 'pure' Hitchcock film, lacking in his trademark acidic humor, and balancing out the expectations of another formidable force. Yet it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films (indeed I far prefer it over Notorious) for its Gothic psychological thriller that seamlessly weaves in and out of an amalgam of other genres; the woman's picture, melodrama, romance, mystery and horror, to name some. The Blu-Ray offers a stellar picture with very little grain and minimal kinks; it is a more than worthy purchase to make for one of the master's largely exemplary works."
Rebecca (1940),Masterpiece by the master of suspense,"One of the greatest movies by Hitchcock and the first he made in the United States, not surprisingly the one that have him his only Academy award for best picture (besides the Oscar for best cinematography, which is indeed very beautiful and impressive). The beginning seems an excellent romantic comedy, what is not usual in Hitchcock's filmography (although it may also be seen in great Lady Vanishes). Gorgeous Joan Fontaine is extremely charming in the role of the clumsy and insecure woman whose name is never mentioned, and she has a good chemistry with Lawrence Olivier as the leading couple. The story has well developed and interesting characters, such as her Mrs. De Winter, his Maxim, and others among whom I may highlight flamboyant Mrs. Van Hopper and creepy Mrs. Danvers. However, an unique element is the strong presence of another character who is indeed absent: the Rebecca from the title, previous Mrs. De Winter. Probably, this is the most striking presence of a character who is only mentioned in the whole history of cinema. After the aforementioned romantic comedy beginning set in Monte Carlo, the movie continues engaging but with a dramatic genre twist, moving to a strong drama and psychological thriller, set in the gargantuan mansion Manderley, in Cornwall. Expect plot twists in this nice script well worked in the brilliant direction of the master of suspense."
Rebecca (1940),Rebecca,"That's the essence of Daphne Du Maurier's book, a book which has never gone out of print, speaking to its cross-generational appeal. The past lives around us. Memories ""stir."" The world is in a state of ""furtive unrest,"" it's full of ghosts making demands on the living, the dead exacting revenge from beyond the grave. When the unnamed narrator of marries the widower Maxim de Winter, she barely knows anything about him. Swept away by this dazzling mysterious man, the naive young woman goes back with him to the family manor, a Gothic monstrosity called ""Manderley."" There, she finds herself in a world dominated by the dead Mrs. De Winter, the mythical ""Rebecca,"" whose presence is still felt, in monogrammed pillows, engraved hair-brushes, not to mention the memories of everyone, who all agree she was the most beautiful woman who ever lived. The new Mrs. De Winter fears she will never measure up. Her fears are justified."
Rebecca (1940),"Excellent Plot and Acting, Nice Setting, Long Scenes","This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. To start, it did not stimulate the viewer, as most modern films do with sex or fantastical CGI. Further, this film has an excellent plot which kept me in suspense nearly every moment of the movie. Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. De Winter was especially great at depicting the part of the new, innocent wife who initially must live in the shadow of the first Mrs. De Winter know as ""Rebecca."" Hitchcock does a great job of using the scenery, especially the symbol of the ocean in the film. My only complaints were that some scenes seemed drawn out or somewhat unnecessary, especially at the beginning, and there are a few instances of obviously fake old-school type acting (in one scene Maxim--Mr. De Winter--""punches"" someone and then there is no mark on the other fellow's face)."
Notorious (1946),Great film that hasn't aged well...,"I have all the respect in the world for Alfred Hitchcock, and his contributions over the years. I have no doubt that ""Notorious"" was a brilliant film when released in 1946, and I wish I had seen it then. But the truth is it hasn't aged particularly well, and seeing it for the first time through 2023 eyes, you realize that, conceptually, films like this have been done far better since then, and this detracts, maybe unfairly, from its impact. That said, I DID enjoy the movie, and it was thrilling to watch (finally). Grant, Bergman, and Rains are all very good, and Hitch, while not at his best, does a fine job with the material he has been given. But I thought the story was a bit thin, that the Grant-Bergman love story wasn't explored properly, the dialogue was spotty, and that the ending felt a bit rushed. Even the details of the nefarious plot and the threat of potential exposure and imminent danger weren't fully realized. Maybe I expected too much? Everyone should see and appreciate this film. It's very good, but to me, it falls just a little short."
Notorious (1946),Great Movie,"""Notorious"" (1946), directed by the iconic Alfred Hitchcock, is a classic espionage thriller that skillfully combines suspense, romance, and intrigue. This film, filled with unforgettable performances and a riveting plot, certainly merits a well-earned 8-star rating. The story revolves around Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, who is recruited by American intelligence agent T. R. Devlin (Cary Grant) to infiltrate a group of Nazis hiding in post-World War II Brazil. As Alicia becomes entangled in a web of espionage and danger, her growing affection for Devlin and the enigmatic Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains) complicates the mission. What sets ""Notorious"" apart is Hitchcock's masterful direction and his ability to create tension in even the most mundane of situations. The film's famous wine cellar sequence is a prime example of Hitchcock's knack for building suspense, and it remains one of cinema's most unforgettable moments. Ingrid Bergman's performance as Alicia is both vulnerable and resilient, making her character complex and engaging. Cary Grant, the epitome of suave charm, delivers a captivating portrayal of Devlin. Claude Rains' portrayal of Alex Sebastian adds depth to the film's morally ambiguous characters. The film explores themes of trust, sacrifice, and love, all within the high-stakes world of espionage. It cleverly blurs the lines between good and evil and questions the choices people make when driven by love and duty. ""Notorious"" also benefits from the sharp and suspenseful script by Ben Hecht, which keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The chemistry between the leads, particularly Grant and Bergman, adds depth to the film's romantic and emotional core. In conclusion, ""Notorious"" is a captivating espionage thriller with memorable performances and Hitchcock's trademark suspenseful direction. Its exploration of love, trust, and sacrifice within the world of espionage makes it a classic in the genre. With its enduring impact and captivating narrative, it confidently earns an 8-star rating."
Notorious (1946),"Hitchcock's response to ""Casablanca""","(1946) Notorious
SUSPENSE/ MYSTERY/ ROMANTIC Adapted from the story ""The Song of the Dragon"" by John Taintor Foote produced, co-written and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, that has Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) spying and sacrificing her love by marrying pro Nazi war criminal, Alexander 'Alex' Sebastian (Claude Rains) who lives with his mother, Madame Sebastian (Leopoldine Konstantin) having a residence in Washington. And while Alicia is reporting to her contact, Devlin (Carey Grant). Claude Rains is excellent as usual whose reminiscent to a momma's boy married to Ingrid Bergman who at first doesn't suspect anything. It has been said this film was Alfred Hitchcock's equivalent of ""Casablanca"", also starring Claude Rains which the main difference with this version is that it's more romanticized. The second of four movies Alfred Hitchcock collaborated with Cary Grant."
Notorious (1946),9/10. Masterpiece,"Watching movies like this is like cleansing your soul. A step forward for your esthetic quality. Nothing wrong in watching trash movies in order to entertain yourself. But your mind is like your house. At some point, you've got to dispose of some stuff. It's the second Hitchcock movie in a row i 've watched recently. I rated VERTIGO 8,9/10. This is -slightly- even better. No words to describe Bergman's performance. Of course, Grant was excellent too. I was not impressed during the first 20 minutes. With each passing second, it was getting better. And better. Final 40-ish minutes are literally nail-biting. I knew he was ""master of suspense"". I didn't know he remains unsurpassed. I am gonna watch every Hitchcock movie from now on."
Notorious (1946),10/10,"While, at times, 'Notorious' can be a gripping espionage and heist-like film with a mostly believable romance; it's also a pretty relentless shaming of a woman's ""notorious"" lifestyle (...geez). Good grief, you can't go more than 5-8 minutes in the first half of this movie without someone (usually guys) commenting about how she ""gets around"". Here I am watching a woman going through a stressful situation (recently losing a close loved one, dealing with a deadly mission, and not having her current love reciprocated) while she's getting emotionally bashed in the process. Heck, who am I supposed to be rooting for here, the ex-lover who would do anything for her while he associates with evil doing German scientists that treat her with respect and dignity (well, until the end of the film) or the hero federal agent she's in love with that keeps reminding her how ""fast"" she works when he gets upset with her. After thinking back about it this way, it's no wonder she's got a drinking problem; who wouldn't? Anyhow, despite even her romantic love (Cary Grant) making disparaging remarks to her, somehow I still believed that these characters care deeply about each other (I credit the acting of Ingrid Bergman over the writing and Cary's mostly mannequin performance here). As far as the story goes, it's pretty standard straightforward stuff really, and it almost feels like this film could have been created by any director. Honestly, if someone showed me a large chunk of this film for the first time without those handful of distinct Hitchcock camera work scenes and asked me who directed it I don't think I would know (even after revisiting a lot of his catalog recently). But, I'm no movie history guru, so maybe this film has been used as a template for other movies so much that it's formula seems tired to me. Outside of the repeated ""easy"" commentary and drunk driving scene, the rest of this movie is fine. You could say that the wine cellar key part was a bit clumsy in the end, but there's not a lot that I would call bad here either. It's an ok movie, but I'd recommend watching a better Cary Grant/Hitchcock film like 'North by Northwest' or 'Suspicion' over this."
Notorious (1946),"One of Hitchcock's 5 or 6 greatest masterpieces, with Bergman and Grant in a disturbing love story perfectly framed in a story of suspense and espionage.","One of Hitchcock's great masterpieces, and the best of his films with Ingrid Bergman. A disturbing love story perfectly framed in a story of suspense and espionage. The entire beginning of the film may seem somewhat rushed, until the arrival in Rio, and of course it is difficult for us to understand today so much concern for the joyful life of the protagonist, for the fact of seeing her hanging out and getting drunk with her friends. We have to put on the glasses of the 40s. We have Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi emigrated to the US and convicted of treason. His daughter, from the moment she discovered what her father was and rejecting him, has dedicated herself to a ""dissolute life"", she is a woman doubly marked, as the daughter of a traitor to the country and as an alcoholic and apparently a woman of many many men. This first scene where Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant appear is magnificent, although we don't find Ingrid's drunkenness entirely credible (one of those perfectly aesthetic drunkennesses where the actress is not allowed to lose an iota of her beauty). Cary Grant is a dark and impassive presence, as he will be throughout the film, watching the girl from a distance. He can be certainly disturbing when he gives her a punch. When Cary Grant offers her to work as a spy for American intelligence, Ingrid Bergman's reaction can be hard to understand: the initial blunt refusal changes in a second when the rich old man comes to pick her up for a luxurious boat trip. Naturally, Ingrid, at that moment, has clearly seen the two options in her life: and being the toy of an elite of rich and libidinous elite does not seem to be the best of the two. So, turned she into a spy, they travel to Rio, awaiting information about their mission. And for eight days, Bergman falls in love with Cary Grant, and a third option seems to emerge in her life, but this option, of course, also depends on Cary Grant. And Cary Grant doesn't seem to be up for the task: distant and somewhat contemptuous of the ""stained"" past of the protagonist, he feels attracted to her, probably falling in love too, but clearly on the defensive: after all, a girl with a past who is the daughter of a traitor is not just a good game. It may be the very least to demand proof that she has changed, a heroic rejection of her past and everything like it. It may almost be better not to get those proofs, and have an excuse not to fall in love. We begin to think that for Grant Ingrid Bergman is a dangerous threat. Hitchcock never shows it more clearly than in the wonderful kissing scene on the hotel terrace. Bergman was never more passionate, sensual and seductive, without getting Grant to abandon a recalcitrant and detached attitude. The camera follows them in a closeness of the most absolute indiscretion, it is almost becoming somewhat embarrassing (and delighting) for us to attend such intimacy. Anyway the call from Grant's boss to meet him in his office and explain what Ingrid's job will consist of seems almost a relief for him. The job turns out to be a mission a la Mata-Hari, and also with a possible old boyfriend of Ingrid's. Enough, Grant thinks, for a converted and sanctified Ingrid to have to unceremoniously reject the job and provide him with the proof he needed. But Ingrid can't take that initiative... without that third option in her life she was talking about showing itself minimally viable, because without Grant and without working as a spy, she's left with drunken binges with the rich. And of course...that third option was up to Grant...who takes a more inscrutable stance than ever. Grant shows his love and respect for her when he talks to his bosses aside, while for her he only has cold and hurtful phrases. It almost seems that Grant is hoping that Ingrid will accept the job of seducing another man, and that way, being able to despise her, she will become a harmless woman. The moments of greatest tension take place at the party of the new and unlikely Sebastian marriage. There are shots as surprising as the beginning of the scene in which the camera initially shows the guests enjoying themselves elegantly at the party, but which becomes more tense as it approaches the object of our concerns: a key hidden in Bergman's hand. It is especially from here that Grant's character becomes more and more unjustifiable, not hesitating in the slightest to put the woman he is in love with in serious trouble in order to get information from the investigation they are carrying out. It would be unbelievable that after the scene at the cellar Bergman would not be discovered, but even so Grant abandons her to her fate without regard. Does it seem so unlikely to him that they will take drastic measures against her? Does it matter so little? At this point it may seem to us that Grant's bitterness and unwarranted rancor has turned into cruelty and sadism. Both Grant and Bergman are terrific. Among the supporting cast, Claude Rains gives enormous relief and sympathy to the character of the villain and especially jealous husband, but the one that is truly unforgettable is Leopoldine Konstantine as his jealous and dangerous mother. When Ingrid is welcomed into her home for the first time, we see her mother descend the stairs from a distance, with a face that we barely make out, but in which we guess a deeply sinister character. As she gets closer, the distrust and resentment she harbors towards the woman with whom his son is in love becomes more and more evident, until for a moment she enters the shadows, and although we are almost sure that she has not changed the expression on her face, when she comes to light again, appears to us as a polite old woman anxious to be pleasant to what may be her future daughter-in-law (in a certain way it is conceptually an inverse shot of the famous tracking shot of the party that is increasingly tense as it approaches the foreground of the key). The romantic music is by Roy Webb, although for the soundtrack of the more suspenseful scene, Hitchcock opts for the Brazilian music that the band plays at the party. Bergman is especially beautiful in this film especially when her hair is let down, and of course her wardrove is by Edith Head. The script, signed by Ben Hecht but in which, as always, Hitchcock was the determining factor, manages to give coherence to all this hodgepodge of emotions and builds around them a story of suspense and mystery using a series of recurring visual elements: bottles of wine, keys, cups of tea, and of course a majestic staircase. But as always with Hitchcock, it's his purely visual storytelling that makes the difference. Many scenes are true masterclasses in cinematic storytelling, the more interesting the less dialogue they have. In short, a masterpiece by the author, among his five or six best films."
Notorious (1946),"""Dry your eyes baby, it's out of character.""","Notorious (1946) - This wasn't a film filled with overly complicated plots and moved freely, but as such it was a little bit slow and dragged out. As one of Hitchcock's I was expecting the content to be much more about the espionage and much less about the romance and I would have liked it more that way too. I wanted to see the sneaking element of it and how they achieved what they set out to do, how they discovered their information, but it was more about Devlin's (Cary Grant) jealousy towards Alicia (Ingrid Bergman) instead, added to a lack of trust which caused even more problems. It didn't have to be like 'James Bond' with gadgets and fast cars, but it just needed that something else to be interesting about it, because the romance was of such a basic formula that it could have been written by anyone and wasn't enough on its own. The leading pair fell in love so quickly, as they tended to do in films of that era, but they were also far too over the top with it and so fakely passionate that it was hard to watch at times. I felt like a cringing teenager watching his Dad kissing his Mum and groaning about it, but it was a lot and very theatrical. Claude Rains, who played the role of Alex, has been really growing on me though. Having seen him in quite a few films lately, it has been easy to see why he got so much work in his time. I really appreciate his clear diction apart from anything else. Cary was his usual self and I suppose that Ingrid Bergman was good too, but nobody really delivered anything outstanding by my standards. Overall, it wasn't the best Hitchcock, the best spy film or film in general for me personally, but it wasn't so bad that I wanted to turn it off. I can't say that I'd watch it again though. 379.99/1000."
Notorious (1946),The Spy Who Loved Me...,"Your father is a traitor and imprisoned, not long after you receive a new commission, to get access to a group, folks you'll really have to dupe, just like your dad, they're quite extreme, right wing conditioned. The recruiter is an agent known as Devlin, it's not long before your both getting new feelings, which are difficult to carry, when you're requested to marry, one of the men, the US has an interest in. At a party as the champagne starts to flow, you take the key and in the cellar you both go, where McGuffin is discovered, not long after you're less mothered, although she has one or two things she will bestow. Cary Grant invariably plays himself with aplomb, or at least the same character he so often portrayed, but it's Ingrid Bergman who steals the show (once again), with a great performance as Alicia Huberman, in a film that intrigues but doesn't really achieve what you'd like it to."
Notorious (1946),A Casablanca with Hitchcock's stamp of paranoia and angst,"The daughter of a convicted Nazi spy (Ingrid Bergman) is compelled by a government agent (Cary Grant) to infiltrate an organization of Nazi refugees in Brazil, where she is used as bait for Alex Sebastian (Claude Rains), an important figure in the organization. The scheme works well until Rains proposes to Bergman, which initiates a cascade of suspicion, masquerade, jealousy and repressed emotions. Hitchcock mixes sentimental romance with fairly reverberant political spy drama in the wake of WWII - a Casablanca with Hitchcock's stamp of paranoia and angst, if you like. The film's power lies in the obscure and implicit. Nobody ever says or does what they really want; they are inhibited by their own reserve and the implications of a world war. When Bergman realizes the danger she's in towards the end, Hitchcock flaunts his visual skills to tighten the grip on her and us. The film's final fifteen minutes are so tense that you may forgive whatever sullen melodrama you've been subjected to along the way. Claude Rains' Oscar nominated performance is a lot more layered than what you might think at first. Grant, on the other hand, never quite gets into his stride in a somewhat unthankful part."
Notorious (1946),Not the first to break the 'kiss rule',"The famous part about Notorious was the kiss scene. Back in the day of the Production Code, it was against the rules to have a kiss last longer than three seconds, so in order to get around that, Alfred Hitchcock told his actors Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman to keep interspersing bits of dialogue in the breaks of their kisses. They talk, they kiss, they talk again, they kiss again. However, if you're a connoisseur of old movies, you know that several movies broke the three-second-rule before Notorious did. Much like Gone With the Wind's hype, it was just publicity rather than fact. If you want to see a movie that really broke the kiss code, rent Fallen Angel and ask, ""Cary who?""
If anyone cares about the plot, it would be best to read about it beforehand. As usual, this Hitchcock drama is very slow-going and quite boring; I had to watch it twice to stay awake long enough to actually understand the story. In any case, Ingrid Bergman gets asked to be a spy by secret agent Cary Grant. Her father was an evil Nazi, and her assignment is to pretend she's following in his footsteps with his old cronies - then report all her findings back to Cary and the government. Claude Rains is the head bad guy, in a different role from Casablanca, but believable as a wealthy, slimy, power-hungry villain nonetheless. Notorious isn't my favorite Hitchcock, so I wouldn't really recommend it unless you love his slow style. You can catch Ingrid and Cary again in Indiscreet, a delightful romantic comedy and reportedly one of their favorites!"
To Have and Have Not (1944),8/10. Recommended,"I can't rate it higher because this is literally a CASABLANCA copycat, trying so hard to repeat its success. I've watched CASABLANCA recently, it became instantly a top 5, and i have watched thousands of movies. I can't overlook this is a copycat. But at the end of the day, i have no problem with that. A copycat of a masterpiece is still a great movie. And i would have rated it higher if the second half was as great as the first. It is not. I would prefer for this movie to focus more on Bogart and Bacall. Their interaction is the greatest quality of this movie. Dialogue is sharp and witty, the chemistry is fantastic. You can feel the tension and the sparkles. Unfortunately, during the second half, there is a not so interesting subplot with not so interesting characters. Make no mistake, this is still exciting. I read that this is Bacall's first movie. I don't understand how a young actress was able to perform like this in her debut. She is more confident than most veteran actors. Of course, it helps if your charisma is like hers. Ending is kinda rushed. Still, a great movie for cinema fans."
To Have and Have Not (1944),When Bogey Met Bacall,"After Lauren Bacall, in her first feature film, says her iconic line about knowing how to whistle and leaves the room, there's a closeup on American charter boat captain Harry 'Steve' Morgan played by Humphrey Bogart, where he practically looks into the camera while doing a wolf-whistle, giving a knowing grin that seems more like a contrived promotion for the lovely newcomer than part of an action thriller, very loosely based on the novel... originally a magazine serial in pulp fiction style... by Ernest Hemingway... However there are a few faithful elements, like the initial fishing trip with irate customer Walter Sande and Bogart's rummy sidekick Walter Brennan, who needs a drink every minute... only this being a movie, the score Mickey Mouses in a dated fashion (mirroring exact character movements), especially with Brennan who, despite being a pathetic lush, is the supposed comic relief in a picture with comedy as one of the genres... Not sure exactly why because the sparse plot, of Bogart hired to ship a boatload of French Resistance Fighters back to the island.. the most anticipated and suspenseful action sequence... is pretty darn grim, before and after reminding audiences of some extremely important elements of that time... Nazis and World War II... making TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT a looser version of the palpably patriotic CASABLANCA, including an initially apolitical anti-hero in a central hotel/nightclub, with pianist Hoagy Carmichael performing soft Latin or Orient influenced tunes in place of the more natural and fitting Arthur ""Play It Again Sam"" Wilson... Meanwhile the chemistry between Bogart and the primary joint's secret pickpocket and sporadic singer Bacall differs from Ingrid Bergman in CASABLANCA since she's not winsome and wispy but the kind of perfect woman not only in looks, but is tough and resilient, like male heroes were depicted back then - so her and Bogey, without the distracting Brennan, could have handled those lethargic German-backed villains just fine on their own... because she needed far more scenes, but without the off-key crooning."
To Have and Have Not (1944),A rehash of Casablanca with the added chemistry of Bogart and Bacall,"It takes place in 1940 in the French colony of Martinique after the invasion of France by Germany. It follows a small boat captain and his alcoholic sidekick as they deal with the challenges of Vichy sympathizers, the French Resistance, and an attractive young singer. American Steve Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) runs a fishing boat that provides deep-sea fishing for tourists. His sidekick, Eddie (Walter Brennan), is an alcoholic. Morgan initially resists pleas from bar owner Gérard (Marcel Dallo) to assist the French Resistance, as he is mercenary and non-political. However, in the bar, Morgan meets 22-year-old ""Slim"" Browning (Lauren Bacall), a floater seeking meaning in life. Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) is the piano player at the bar and eventually gets Slim to sing with the band. The film follows Morgan's interaction with a corrupt fishing client (Walter Sande), Vichy Police Capitaine Renard (Dan Seymour), two French Resistance operatives (Walter Surovy and Dolores Moran), and his evolving relationship with Slim. By the end, some main characters sail away to further adventures. In many ways, ""To Have and Have Not"" is a rehash of ""Casablanca"" with the added chemistry of the Bogart and Bacall relationship that began with this film when Bacall was 19. That chemistry completely changed the original storyline, but it works. The reality of ""To Have and Have Not"" is no greater than ""Casablanca,"" but it's well done. Dolores Moran's role seems lost, but Walter Brennan is very effective. Hoagy Carmichael's music is fantastic. This is a fun movie."
To Have and Have Not (1944),Gets an extra star for being a b/w vintage classic,"Bogie & Bacall. Legendary partnership, like Burton & Taylor. To Have and Have Not. Not too faithful to Hemingway, or so they say. Maybe that's not for the best. Bogie plays the peculiarly named Harry ""Steve"" Morgan, a boatman who takes people fishing off Martinique. Vichy France is in charge (Boo!). Marie (Bacall) glides into town and Harry stops her waltzing away with his client's wallet. From such begins a legendary movie and real life love affair. When Harry decides to do a dangerous job on behalf of the other France (Bravo!), things get messy. The movie stars people who were in Casablanca with Bogie, as well as Hoagy Carmichael at the piano and that actor, Walter Brennan. Who typically got shot in westerns. There's a bit later on which is so appallingly brown-tongueing to Bogart, and by extension all US manhood, as to make the movie temporarily intolerable. At which point it is no surprise to learn from Wiki that this movie got mixed reviews when it was new. Bacall and Bogart have superb chemistry together, but heavens! She cannot, cannot sing. She's even worse than Audrey Hepburn. With the passage of the decades, some of these golden oldies don't look so gleamy, but one can't deny that, dubious as some of the plotting may be, they have real style. It's always refreshing to see a man on screen, not a dude, and Bogart was a man like John Wayne was, but less in need of his fists than the Duke. No wonder Marie chose to stick around. It ain't Casablanca, but then nothing else is."
To Have and Have Not (1944),A Bit of a Déjà Vu Thing...,"There's not a lot of difference from before, as Martinique trumps Morocco and takes the floor, for two people to engage, to take true love right off the page, along with passion, feeling, fire, it's still amour. This time it's Steve, or is it Harry, could it be Rick, who sides against the baddies with their stick, although Dan Seymour isn't Claude, and his accent is a fraud, Slim as Ilsa brings the right amount of click. Perhaps events that happened away from the screens, suggests this film has more importance than it seems, but I'm not sure just what arouses, Lauren's interest in those trouser, as men of a certain age, should not wear jeans."
To Have and Have Not (1944),This is a gem with fantastic execution by the cast and production team,"To Have and Have Not (1944) is a movie that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a boat operator whose business is down due to the ongoing World War that he tries to stay out of. He takes on a mission against his better judgement to take someone against the Nazis to safety. Meanwhile, he's in love with a local singer, whether he knows it or not, and this love story may be at risk due to his upcoming adventure. This movie is directed by Howard Hawks (Rio Bravo) and stars Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca), Lauren Bacall (The Big Sleep), Walter Brennan (Red River), Dolores Moran (Christmas Eve) and Dan Seymour (The Big Heat). The storyline for this picture was interesting but it was the characters and the various sub plots and interactions that made this movie magic. The cast is outstanding with Bogart being smooth and slick with his responses and Bacall being an absolute smoke show. The camera angles in this were amazing and well done and the circumstances were unpredictable. The final shootout was intense and well done and I loved the closing song. Overall, this is a gem with fantastic execution by the cast and production team. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
To Have and Have Not (1944),When Bogey Met Betty,"Yes, the plot and characters of this movie may have blown over all the way from North Africa, more specifically Casablanca to the Caribbean French overseas colony of Martinique, but the backdrop is still the Second World War, Its male star is of course Humphrey Bogart and he's up to his neck again in foreign intrigue, trying to smuggle a Resistance fighter and his wife away from the German controlled authorities and of course there's a beautiful woman involved, although on the last point he at least strikes it lucky, this time running into Lauren Bacall, here making a sensational debut appearance. The phrase ""world-weary' could have been invented for Bogart's character in both films as here again he falls into a dangerous rescue mission against his own better judgement, just as he finds himself drawn to Bacall's Slim character, a confident, strikingly attractive young woman who sometimes sings for barroom bandleader Hoagy Carmichael. We all know the story of how these two immediately connected on set and carried through their on-screen romance into real life and you pick up on the frisson between them immediately, helped immeasurably by some wonderfully crisp and occasionally risqué dialogue dreamed up for them. To be truthful there isn't a lot of action on display but director Hawks succeeds in quickly setting the scene and then ramping up the tension as his characters interact and the narrative plays out. Yes, the scene between the new lovers where Bacall utters her famous ""You know how to whistle..."" line is justly famous but there are plenty of others too, right up to the point where Bacall shimmies her way to safety at the end Hawks directs with his usual brio but is never in a hurry to finish scenes and rush onto the next one. Based on Hemingway's source story, adapted by William Faulkner with reputed input from Hawks and even his real-life wife plus some improvisation by the cast themselves, this is a film which flies on the quality of its dialogue and is it ever good, indeed if ever a movie spoke for itself, this is it. With great support from songwriter Carmichael in an acting role and Walter Brennan as Bogart's ""rummy"" ship-mate, while you can easily imagine Greenstreet and Lorre in the parts of their one-step-behind pursuers, there are in truth no real weak links in the cast wherever you look. Some films have it and some have not and this one definitely falls into the former category."
To Have and Have Not (1944),You can see the love develop before your eyes,"It's so much fun watching Bogey fall in love in this movie. A few tables away, Bacall immediately zeroes in on him with the undistracted focus of a hungry predator. He looks up and realizes that, of all the men in the room, he's her next meal. He reacts with raised eyebrows, a delighted smile, and straightened posture. He puts up no defenses. His ego doesn't get in the way. He just takes her advances as they come and happily falls in step with her, taking control and changing direction only when necessary. And when she interacts with others, he watches her antics with a proud smile. You can see that he trusts her completely. There is genuine affection. No wonder she falls for him so deeply."
To Have and Have Not (1944),Most memorable for Bogart and Becall's on screen chemistry,"(1944) To Have and Have Not
CRIME DRAMA Produced and directed by Howard Hawks adapting from the book by Ernest Hemingway of the same name was also credited for the screenplay . The movie that is somewhat similar and consist of many themes to 1942 Casablanca, Bogart as a skipper Harry ""Steve"" Morgan paid to move illegal cargo to and from the island of France. Until he was offered to move human passage as the Nazis are moving in. Except this film resembles more closely to ""film noir"" than Casablanca as well as the whole notion of trying to get away by boat! It was also the first of 4 movies Bogart and Becall collaborated together on screen together before tying the knot!"
To Have and Have Not (1944),Mature beyond their years...,"Was surprised to find Lauren Bacall and Dolores Moran, 20 and 18 respectively, go toe to toe with veterans Bogart Brennan, and Hoagy Carmichael et al , and hold their own. Bacall continued to great success obviously, but I feel Moran, who had a very short career, could have continuing on to greatness as well with solid roles. Moran's and Bacall's maturity as actors this early in their careers is truly remarkable. Not sure who would be comfortable today. Jennifer Lawrence perhaps. The storyline of the film is timely and engaging, set shortly after the German occupation of France. Roughly the same time period as Casablanca."
Touch of Evil (1958),7.8/10. Recommended,"I watched it last night for the first time. Orson Welles' directing skills are unparalleled, this movie is literally a pioneer for modern cinema. There are no words for the opening sequence. It's unbelievable that this movie is 65 years old. I enjoyed every second of it. It's a very good crime drama movie with good pace and many intense moments. I can't name it a masterpiece though because it's not always convincing. Heston's character left alone his newlywed wife in order to solve a crime which was not even in his jurisdiction. With so many enemies, nobody would leave his wife alone in an abandoned hotel in a foreign country. In their honeymoon. If something like that had happened in a movie nowadays, noone would have bought it and everyone would find it ridiculous. In any case, actors are great, it's well directed and for sure, this is timeless. A classy movie that every cinema fan should watch it."
Touch of Evil (1958),"It's not Orson Welles' best work, and there are some problems and wrong choices, but it's still a worthwhile film.","One crime and two totally different men: this sentence almost sums up the entire film. Director Orson Welles is one of those monsters that we are used to having like a ""sacred cow"", who turns everything he touches into gold. And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very recently that it was possible to have access to a version of this film that was similar to what its director's creative vision was. . Just similar! And what we have here is an incredibly complex film that we cannot summarize as easily as I did: the initial crime is just the incident that triggers the action, and its relevance, we found, is really insignificant. What counts here is the struggle of personalities, the battle between the conflicting egos of two police officers who decide to solve the case, each in their own way. In fact, it is not the most appealing film that the director's career has given us, but it is still valuable for that reason. And to understand Welles' vision, it's not enough to see the film once. We have to understand nuances that go unnoticed by an inattentive eye. It's an exercise for cinema experts, more than for me, who am part of the common popcorn-eating public, but even I saw that the work before me deserved to be seen in detail. The film that has come down to us allows us to see the brilliance of Welles, who was also responsible for the dialogues and the script created, full of twists and turns that can complicate things a little for us if we are not paying attention, and, but it also gives us good actors in a decent dramatic exercise. Charlton Heston is a safe bet, but it's also a big casting mistake: he's too Anglo-Saxon to be credible as a Latino! Welles brought the other main character to life, and is effective and dominant in the role. To a certain extent, he never seems like a police officer, but just another criminal in a land where those in charge are those who impose themselves through violence. Even so, I noticed that he is a physically worn-out man, and this fragility ruins the effect he intends to achieve. Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the cinematography, which in Welles' films is almost always one of the director's signatures. In addition to the use of intelligent visual effects, the director dedicated himself to the camera work and the choice of each perspective, each framing, and also in the editing, which was ruined by the studio's intervention. The filming locations and sets are realistic and convince us quite well, and the soundtrack is effective."
Touch of Evil (1958),Masterstroke of Cinematic Artistry,"Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" is a quintessential film noir, an audacious fusion of style and substance that underscores the director's mastery over the medium. Released in 1958, it's a compelling exploration of the blurry lines between good and evil, carried by an all-star cast and an abundance of stylistic flair. The plot revolves around a border-town murder mystery, with Charlton Heston portraying the honest Mexican narcotics officer, Mike Vargas, and Welles himself as the corrupt American police captain, Hank Quinlan. The stark contrast between these two characters lays the foundation for a captivating narrative that traverses a morally ambiguous landscape. Heston and Welles deliver powerful performances, each embodying their character's attributes with convincing authenticity. Janet Leigh, as Vargas' newlywed wife, is also noteworthy, adding a touch of vulnerability to the plot's tension-charged atmosphere. Welles' directorial genius shines throughout the film, exemplified in the famous opening shot: a single, unbroken three-minute take that is as suspenseful as it is technically impressive. His innovative use of camera angles, shadow, and sound creates an atmospheric setting that truly brings the narrative to life. ""Touch of Evil"" boasts striking cinematography, marked by deep shadows, skewed angles, and stark contrasts that capture the essence of film noir. The eclectic score, ranging from lively mariachi music to hauntingly eerie compositions, complements the visual storytelling effectively. However, the real triumph of ""Touch of Evil"" lies in its ability to provoke thought. It doesn't merely serve as a gripping mystery; it offers a profound exploration of the human condition, illustrating how the road to hell can often be paved with good intentions. That said, the film is not without its share of potential drawbacks. Some viewers might find its complex narrative structure and moral ambiguity challenging to follow. Additionally, the decision to cast Heston as a Mexican officer, while a testament to his acting prowess, may seem questionable from today's perspective. Yet, despite these potential criticisms, ""Touch of Evil"" remains an undeniable masterpiece in the realm of film noir. Its ability to blend a riveting plot with masterful cinematography, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking themes leaves a lasting impression. In conclusion, ""Touch of Evil"" is a tour de force of cinematic artistry that transcends its genre. It is a movie that makes you think, feel, and appreciate the depth of human complexity, all while immersing you in a world of suspense and intrigue. Whether you're a fan of film noir or simply a lover of fine cinema, ""Touch of Evil"" is a must-watch that continues to resonate with audiences to this day."
Touch of Evil (1958),A great detective but a lousy cop.,"When Universal hired Orson Welles to appear in TOUCH OF EVIL, he had long been considered a Hollywood outcast due to his rebellious nature and disdain for the front office. In addition to acting, he also ended up being hired to write and direct TOUCH OF EVIL thanks to the insistence of star Charlton Heston, who was recently basking in the success of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and therefore had enough clout to chose whoever he wanted for a director. Ever since appearing in THE THIRD MAN, Welles remained in Europe to continue his filmmaking away from Tinseltown's radar, fed up with executives re-editing his finished product against his wishes. Contrary to legend, it wasn't TOUCH OF EVIL that brought Welles back to America. He'd already returned to New York in the mid Fifties to act on television and radio before getting the call from Universal. Welles wanted Janet Leigh to play Heston's wife and sent her a telegram thanking her for accepting.....before her agent had a chance to contact her!!! Welles also pulled off some casting coups that Universal execs didn't see coming. He convinced old friend Marlene Dietrich to appear as a Gypsy madam under near-heavy disguise and, during an advanced screening, the higher-ups were flabbergasted to see Frau Dietrich up there. They had no idea she was in the cast. Welles also persuaded former members of his old Mercury Theatre ~and CITIZEN KANE co-stars~ Joseph Cotten and Ray Collins to join. (Cotten's was an uncredited cameo.) However, Welles must have been overcome with a sense of déjà vu during postproduction because, once again, he butted heads with the front office. Unhappy with his final cut, Universal proceeded to edit TOUCH OF EVIL against his wishes. Upon learning what was afoot, an impassioned Welles wrote a memo containing almost sixty pages of suggested revisions, all of which fell on deaf ears. When the film was finally released, it was written off as a B-movie with an A-list pedigree. More than forty years later, Universal had the opportunity to right that wrong when Welles' memo was unearthed, containing all his suggestions for improvement. Using that memo as a guideline, famed editor Walter Murch was brought in to revise TOUCH OF EVIL according to Welles' wishes. The result was a masterpiece restored. The first five minutes of TOUCH OF EVIL is a glorious, unbroken tracking shot beginning on the Mexican side of the border town Los Robles, in which a mysterious figure plants a time bomb in the trunk of a car. Getting into the car is a prominent American citizen accompanied by some lady of the evening, where they drive up the street to the customs station. Walking alongside them is Miguel ""Mike"" Vargas (played by the Caucasian Heston in a bit of casting that would raise eyebrows today), a vacationing Mexican narc enjoying his a honeymoon with American wife Susie (Leigh). The famous tracking shot ends with a deafening explosion as the car detonates, killing both occupants. Heading the investigation is Chief Hank Quinlan (Welles), a grotesquely obese man whose mumbling makes Marlon Brando enunciate like Laurence Olivier. Quinlan is renowned among the community and beyond for his intuitive spot-on hunches, to which he attributes a gimpy leg from an old bullet injury. (In DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Edward G Robinson's sixth sense was brought on by indigestion). A recovering alcoholic, Quinlan is admired by superiors and underlings alike for never having taken a dishonest dollar in his life. His poultry ranch seems to be the only thing keeping him from a vow of poverty. With attributes such as these, it would be tempting to vote Quinlan as lawman of the year..... except that he's an unapologetic racist! He's lived in a border town for probably most of his life, and has performed his duty on both sides, but has never bothered to learn or speak Spanish. He treats white suspects and witnesses with the appropriate decorum, but less so with their non-white counterparts. Vargas himself has a stellar professional reputation on both sides as an oficial de narcóticos. Recently, he gained fame and respect for his arrest of a big time Mexican gangster named Vince Grandi, whose brother Joe fancies himself the unofficial godfather of Los Robles. Being a younger and Hispanic detective, plus being married to a white woman, Vargas unwittingly taps into the darkest recesses of Quinlan's psyche, since it's obvious the lawman is not the staunchest advocate for miscegenation. However, it's the policing methods that really set the two men apart from one another. Vargas is a by-the-book cop who believes in due process, while Quinlan is not above using some....uh, primitive persuasion to obtain a confession. These differences will come to a head when Quinlan arrests the Mexican boyfriend of the dead man's daughter following the alleged discovery of two incriminating sticks of dynamite in the suspect's bathroom. Vargas doesn't see it so open and shut because he was just washing his hands in the bathroom prior to the search and never saw the evidence where Quinlan claimed it was! Vargas openly accuses him of framing the Hispanic, and vows to formally raise the matter with the proper authorities. The stage is now set for the inevitable collision course as Quinlan, desperate to clear his name and slander Mike Vargas, forms an unholy alliance with Joe Grandi, who has his own reasons for wanting to discredit Vargas. Because the narco cannot be intimidated, Grandi believes that the best way to control Vargas is by involving Susie into their deadly cat and mouse game. I've seen lots of black & white films noir that visually convey the danger element for every drop that can be squeezed. THE MALTESE FALCON, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE KILLERS, and THE BIG SLEEP, all moody crime tales set within the asphalt jungle, are among the greatest of the genre. TOUCH OF EVIL, taking place taking place in arid and rural surroundings, tops them all pictorially with its vivid illustrations of sheer decadence. Off the top of my head, an example of overwhelming atmosphere is a foreground of newspapers blowing across a windy street complemented by a background of endlessly pumping oil derricks. Oh, and Henry Mancini's offbeat Latino rock score contribute enormously to the sinful climate. Welles' camera is more than just a camera; it's a window into the seedy soul of human nature: the brothels, the nearly topless bars, and hints of reefer madness. Welles pushed that envelope as far as he could in 1958. Like IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT a decade later, the murder investigation almost takes a back seat to the personality conflicts of its two leads who are different morally as they are racially. Heston's later-in-life right-wing politics didn't produce an admirer in me, but complaints about his being cast as a Hispanic, pre-civil rights, should be answered with a resounding shout down. Yes, a Caucasian taking on a role like that would be politically incorrect today, but TOUCH OF EVIL was made in a far different era, a time before Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez became household names. Besides, any rational mind could see this casting wasn't anywhere on the same level as D. W. Griffith's notoriously racist BIRTH OF A NATION. In Welles' lifetime even his enemies had to grudgingly admit he was a genius. Posthumously, as his films are routinely analyzed and re-analyzed, he's now regarded as one of the greatest and most misunderstood artists of the 20th century. For film noir lovers, their libraries will never be complete without TOUCH OF EVIL. 🔚"
Touch of Evil (1958),Touch of Evil,"We start with a man putting a bomb in a car on the Mexican side of the border. When it explodes on the American side flattening the occupants, the local ""Capt. Quinlan"" (Orson Welles) decides to make a bit of a cursory investigation - in cahoots with his opposite number ""Vargas"" (Charlton Heston). Whilst they are out doing their sleuthing, ""Susan Vargas"" (Janet Leigh) is lured to a meeting with ""Uncle Joe"" (Akim Tamiroff) where it becomes clear that her husband is on the prosecuting side of a family dispute that is putting everyone in danger - something her husband finds out shortly afterwards when he narrowly avoids an acid facial. Now ""Quinlan"" and his sidekick ""Menzies"" (Joseph Calleia) have a rather unique way of working - the former intimidates just with his presence and has the District Attorney in his pocket, but as this investigation starts to spread out the original crime pails into insignificance as ""Susan"" finds herself trapped in an out of town motel and the potential victim of a ghastly drug crime that brings the threads of the story - and the true criminality to light - fatally. There are five principal characters and the actors do justice to them all - the story moves along darkly offering plenty of interest, the odd red herring and a particularly strong effort from Welles as the increasingly unlikeable policeman. I was slightly dubious about Heston playing a Mexican policeman, but here carries of the role in one of his better screen performances (when he is not wearing leather garments) and Janet Leigh - well, she was always an actor who made it all look effortless. The ending combines the scary with the brutal but will the truth be out? Big screen must for the full potency of the last twenty minutes."
Touch of Evil (1958),"Exquisite, masterful, absolutely essential","Film noir is already a genre that is defined in large part by artistic flourishes in its craftsmanship to reshape and lend flavor to the crime thriller and drama. I don't think it's unfair to say that Orson Welles' vision for this feature takes that tendency to another level. From the very opening shot those minutiae that audiences often take for granted all build tension and suspense, and contribute strongly to the storytelling, as much as Welles' own adapted screenplay. Walter Murch's painstaking, somewhat unorthodox editing (in the 1998 restoration, accordingly following Welles' notes) is a wondrous gift; Russell Metty's truly exquisite, sharp, dynamic cinematography quite makes this worth watching all by itself; the precise use of light and shadow has rarely felt more alive in a film; Welles' meticulous fundamental orchestration of shots and scenes is some of the most gratifyingly robust direction to readily come to mind. From the very start, in even the most basic of ways, 'Touch of evil' is an extraordinary, captivating picture that demands viewer engagement as much for the intricacy of its construction and plot, and the excellence thereof, as for the swiftness of the pacing. For those very same reasons this is marginally challenging, but all the more terrific for the fact of it. This has a very high reputation, and it's fully deserved; frankly, this is surely one of the greatest of all film noir titles, if not altogether one of the best movies ever made. There are times when the marvel of the work behind the scenes, including production design and filming locations, threatens to overshadow other elements to some degree. And that's saying a lot, because the acting is strikingly potent. From one scene to the next a different actor may stand out most, but across the board everyone gives a smart, rather intense performance that holds fast our attention. Given the most time on-screen naturally Janet Leigh, Charlton Heston, and Welles stand out most, with stark poise and force of personality, and particularly noteworthy nuance and range in Leigh's case. Yet even those in smaller supporting parts all distinctly stand out in their own ways, lending tremendously to the raw tenor of the tableau, including Joseph Calleia, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Dennis Weaver, and more. And yet, for as great as the acting is, and for as exceptional as the craftsmanship is, still the writing is possibly more darkly vibrant and ferocious. Noir commonly goes to grim forbidding places with a harsh miasma of foul figures, dirty deeds, and bad business, spiraling ever outwards and downwards. It hardly seems plausible, but 'Touch of evil' becomes more terrible yet - if not outright bleak - in a tale of utmost corruption, abuse of power, and lack of accountability. Every facet of the screenplay bristles with biting electricity that keeps us firmly locked in through every seedy turn, to the point that for as much as Welles earned his esteem as both an actor and a director, his shrewd wit as a writer may actually have been greater yet. Furthermore, it seems impossible to talk about this picture without also mentioning the original music of Henry Mancini. Every theme to greet our ears resounds with vivid clarity that feeds stupendously into the gnawing, clamorous airs otherwise achieved. A score is always important to any movie, even when it sticks to the background, but some immediately pop out more than others. Though no singular instance may stick out from Mancini's work here, let there be no doubt that Welles' masterpiece surely couldn't be the incredible tour de force that it is without these compositions. And that's kind of the real takeaway here: nothing in 'Touch of evil' is superfluous, and there is no part without which it could be complete, because this is a perfect creation. It's immensely absorbing, entertaining, and satisfying as a viewer despite and because of its gloomy narrative, its riveting acting, its rich music, and the fastidious, careful, fabulously attentive contributions of every last person operating behind the scenes. I could easily imagine the feature being broken down frame by frame for analysis of its composition, and to do so would be a worthy pursuit for the supreme mindfulness with which the production was approached. By all means, I assumed I would enjoy this based on what I knew of it ahead of time, and still I'm totally blown away; it cannot be overstated how utterly superb this title is. Given the dour subject matter and story I can maybe understand how it won't readily appeal to all comers, but some movies supersede questions of personal preference. In all honesty 'Touch of evil' is something that everyone owes it to themselves to watch at least once, and I can't offer any recommendation higher than that."
Touch of Evil (1958),A Touch Well Done Actually!,"Touch Of Evil (1958) - This was the best performance I have ever seen from Orson Welles. Up until this point I had been very disappointed with 'Citizen Kane' (1941), 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947), 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942) and 'The Third Man' (1949) and as such I could not for the life of me understand why he was so well regarded by the film industry and critics. For instance, all of those films mentioned were featured on Stephen Schneider's Top 1001 films list. Perhaps if the reverence for Mr. Welles was based on just this film and others that he might have done with a similarly fantastic performance I would understand, because Orson WAS very good in this one and really he lead the whole film for me. These are all things that I never thought that I would hear myself saying about the man, having not just disliked his other roles and films, but found them to be awful. Needless to say that I was a little bit surprised, but happily so. However, another actor that I have never been fond of, Charlton Heston, didn't improve my opinions of his abilities with his performance in this film, because he was as wooden as ever and didn't come across as Mexican in any way at all. It might have been better if he had at least had an accent, because it was harder to believe the dispute between them based on his ethnic background and thus the whole racial issue was much less clear due to it. I did think that Marlene Dietrich in her role of Tanya needed a bigger part though. I liked her character and thought that there was more to discover about her, almost as if she might be the focus of the next episode, if it had been a TV series and they were trying to spread out some of the mystery. And I did have to feel for poor Janet Leigh who never seems to have had a good time of it at roadside motels. The filming style was as if the Director didn't want to have the same shot for more than a few seconds at a time and was somewhat like a game of tennis to watch, backwards and forwards all the time from face to face, car to building, Etc. I got whiplash at some points. And there were some other odd touches that didn't seem to be necessary to the plot, but I supposed added colour. Their was a weird bit with a wig and then a blind woman in a shop and also a very small lift. I wasn't sure why they put them in. Maybe they were just trying to distract the audience from the rest of the mystery with extraneous information, but it just stuck out to me. I did feel that because the film appeared to be quite rushed that there were bits that weren't given their full time to sink in for the viewer, so there were points where I wasn't sure if I'd missed something, as other things progressed. As soon as one thing was revealed, another thing was uncovered and I was still thinking about the first thing, if you catch my drift. It was also quite brutal for it's time, the violence seemed more than the usual for a 1958 film and it was added to by the music, which was a bit loud and overwhelming. I supposed that was the point, because it made me anxious, corrupt police films always rile me up anyway. Where are the 'Serpico's' (1973) when you need them? Charlie tried to deliver something similar, but just couldn't pull it off. I was hugely impressed by this one, which was far from how I had imagined that it would turn out. I would go so far as to say that I enjoyed it. The mystery and intrigue was engaging, although I did think that a modern version could bring much more to it, without the cuts and restrictions of the studio executives and censorship of the 1950's. I'd like to see that too. 640.15/1000."
Touch of Evil (1958),The opening isn't the most impressive shot,"Everyone talks about the 4 minute single take opening, which was remarkable for the time, but there is an even more impressive cinematic marvel that occurs about 39 minutes into the film. It is the apartment of Sanchez, the shoe clerk, and the shot runs for 5 minutes and 23 seconds without a cut. There are over 20 different camera set-ups within this one scene, smoothly flowing from one to another to another. Supposedly this was the only locale in the film that was a studio set and that helped pull off the coordination of so many elements. Considering how much exposition, character set-up, and drama is on display in this one shot, it's the real gem."

Touch of Evil (1958),Not so good,"I was watching a TV program in which film critics were discussing film noir and this was considered the pinnacle of the genre and one critic even said it was the best film. I usually respect their opinions and other film noir were mentioned that I know are very good, so I thought this is a must watch. The opening 3 minutes tracking shot is very clever, but I was always aware of it being a clever tracking shot. The rest of the film was very similar. The acting was secondary and the lines were delivered too deliberately and seemed to be not quite on the beat. And how or why Dennis Weaver's performance was allowed, I will never know! Imagine Eugene from Grease going ashore with Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan!! A good idea and in the hands of a better director would have been so much better."
Niagara (1953),How is this a good movie?,"Way to many coincidences. It wasn't clear how Rose was sure George would follow her into the tunnel. Nor was it clear how her lover knew to get in the elevator. Nor how he was able to kidnap George or if he magically confronted him later. Effectively she has to hope George will follow, hope George will not confront her at the caves and not see her not go in elevator. Hope that he will get in the elevator. Then we're left to guess how her lover will magically get George alone without all the other tourist to the caves not seeing their scuffle. Polly and Ray go on a tour of ""the caves"". Magically George just happens to show up there. It makes zero sense. Why would he go there? A place where he'd be likely to be seen by Ray? What did he hope to accomplish. You'd think he'd just run. George kills Rose but she never screams for help. She even tried to call the police. If she was willing to call the police, why wouldn't she scream for help? Magically, Polly and Ray just happen to land their boat at the exact place George is looking for a boat and at the same time frame. On the boat George pushes Polly and she immediately faints? WTF? She also never screams or calls for help before this point. Why didn't George even try to get off the boat? The only good thing about the movie, it really made me want to see Niagara Falls in person."
Niagara (1953),Just go with the Flow...,"There are good reasons why suspicions make you wary, why your blood begins to boil and you're not cheery, as every glance catches the eye, as all the fellas like to spy, because your lady's quite the opposite, of dreary. In addition she's evasive and quite cunning, reticent and secretive and not forthcoming, your lack of trust is justified, as all she does it tell you lies, while she schemes to cause and end that's unbecoming. Who wouldn't be perpetually jealous and suspicious with a screen goddess for a partner, so George Loomis should take some consolation that most mortal men would have given an arm and a leg to have been married to Rose, although they'd have spent most of the time pinching themselves and asking how!"
Niagara (1953),Lack of Malevolence of Antagonist Principals Sink Hitchcock Wannabe Thriller,"The idea behind ""Niagara"" was to create a Hitchcock-like thriller set against the breathtaking backdrop of Niagara Falls. However, Director Henry Hathaway and his team fell short in their execution, failing to deliver the compelling and sinister characters needed to drive the story forward. The narrative revolves around two honeymooners, Polly and Ray Cutler (played by Jean Peters and Max Showalter, respectively), who unwittingly become entangled in a domestic conflict involving George Loomis (Joseph Cotton), an Army veteran suffering from PTSD, and his seductive wife, Rose (Marilyn Monroe). The events unfold at a motor lodge near the Falls, where both couples are staying. Rose, fed up with her volatile husband, conspires with her lover Patrick (Richard Allan) to orchestrate an accident at the Falls that would eliminate George. Unfortunately, the film fails to capitalize on the suspense of the murder, as it is never shown on screen. This absence diminishes the tension and leaves the audience wanting more. Unexpectedly, a major plot twist occurs when Rose faints upon identifying a body at the morgue. Later, we learn that the body is actually Rose's lover, and George is still alive. However, the missed opportunity to film a murder in silhouette, without revealing the twist, further weakens the impact of the narrative. In a Hitchcockian film, George would have been a menacing character pursuing Polly, the only person aware of his survival. However, instead of becoming a true threat, he simply implores her to keep his secret so he can assume a new identity. While he does stalk her, he ultimately saves her from a life-threatening situation at the Falls when a railing gives way. George's decision to strangle Rose appears more driven by emotional instability than true menace, and Monroe fails to convincingly portray a dangerous femme fatale. A personal theory regarding Monroe's performance is that her inherent insecurity prevented her from projecting malevolence, even while playing a role. It should be noted, however, that her performance in ""Niagara"" surpasses her portrayal of a blonde bimbo in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,"" which was released around the same time. As the plot of ""Niagara"" unfolds, there are several suspect narrative issues including the verisimilitude of Showalter's character Ray. When Polly claims to have seen George, Ray dismisses her account, and she fails to pursue the matter further. Even the investigating detective neglects to question Polly when she mentions seeing George. These inconsistencies undermine the credibility of the story and the characters' actions. The climactic scene also falls short. Polly is never truly endangered by George, and her peril only arises after she is accidentally knocked unconscious while still in the boat. The suspense of the boat heading toward the Falls is ruined by the amateurish use of rear projection, failing to create a believable sense of danger for both Polly and George. Director Henry Hathaway had expressed his desire to cast James Mason in the role of George, and it becomes evident that Joseph Cotton's portrayal lacks the necessary intensity and menace. However, Jean Peters shines as the film's true star, convincingly embodying a good person trapped in a perilous situation. ""Niagara"" also suffers from continuity issues. Despite being set on the Canadian side of the border, most scenes featuring Canadian law enforcement were removed by the director and producer, assuming an American audience would struggle to relate to personnel from another country. Nevertheless, the true standout of ""Niagara"" is the magnificent color cinematography showcasing the grandeur of Niagara Falls and its surroundings. The stunning visuals serve as the film's saving grace, evoking awe, and providing a mesmerizing backdrop to an otherwise flawed thriller."
Niagara (1953),Exciting but not perfect,"The advertisements for Niagara ranked seeing Marilyn Monroe's body as highly as Niagara Falls, so if she's your favorite celebrity girlfriend, you've probably seen this movie more times than you can count. If you've only seen a couple of modern biopics about the famous sex symbol, this won't give you the most accurate impression of her screen persona. You might want to rent it after Gentlemen Prefer Blondes or How to Marry a Millionaire. This wasn't her usual role, but I appreciated seeing her in it, because I've read enough biographies to realize she wasn't the innocent victim she wanted to appear to be. In Niagara, she's Joseph Cotten's unhappy and unfaithful wife. Joe does have some mental problems, but when Marilyn cries on people's shoulders to gain sympathy, perhaps she's overplaying her hand. Her latest targets: honeymooners Jean Peters and Max Showalter. They're staying in a nearby bungalow by the falls, and their joyous vacation is dampened by Marilyn and Joe's baggage. Filmed on location, you'll get to see fun scenery like the Maid in the Mist boat tour and the climb up to the falls. Director Henry Hathaway certainly had his hands full, with the slick watery conditions and a notoriously difficult leading lady. This thriller is relatively exciting, even though it's not perfect. Max is exceedingly goofy, and some of the sequences try to recreate Hitchcock's slow rhythm. If you do like Hitchcock flicks, this is a good one to compare them to."
Niagara (1953),Falls pretense,"""Niagara"" is a pretty short title for this rather short movie we have here as it stays under the 1.5-hour mark, even if not by a lot. The film is from 1953, which means that it has its 70th anniversary this year in 2023 and which sadly also means that nobody working on it is with us anymore. I guess nobody who knows a bit about movie is surprised that here we have a sound movie and not a silent film anymore, but this being a color film and not black-and-white is something that may surprise some. In the early/mid-1950s color films were still far from common and usually it was films from the comedy genre that had color and this one here is of course a drama movie with virtually no comedic elements altogether. The director is Henry Hathaway and he is remembered for the Oscar nomination he scored almost 20 years before this one and also for directing the film ""True Grit"" that remade (excellently) by the Coens a few years ago and Hathaway's old version was also of course the film that got western legend John Wayne the Oscar. At that point, Wayne was already over the age of 60, but Hathaway was even 70 or slightly over as he was still born in the previous century, which means he was in his mid50s for this one here. So let's get back to ""Niagara"": The three writers are Brackett, Reisch and Breen and these three did not only come up with the screenplay for this film we have here in terms of 1953 releases, but they also came up with the script for ""Titanic"" and that one them the Oscar, which was definitely the biggest career success for all three of them, even if with Brackett and his long history with the Academy Awards, including two more wins, say that there are other contenders for his most glorious work as well, certainly the script for the film ""Sunset Boulevard"" from a few years earlier. With Breen, it is not such a close call and ""Titanic"" is probably his most known work, but with Reisch, who is also interesting to me because of his origins, you will also find ""Ninotcka"" (Lubitsch, Garbo), a film I really, really liked, and ""Gaslight"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" (another collaboration with Brackett) in his body of work and it is tougher to choose his most known. ""Niagara"" it certainly is not despite the inclusion or Marilyn Monroe, but we will get to her later. But yeah, I have to stay with Reisch a little longer because he originates from German-speaking territory and so do I and he has over 100 credits in his body of work although he has almost no credits in the last 25 years of his life, but yeah he worked on so many German films until 1933 and then he had to leave the country and continued his successes in America, so in a way what happened in Germany in the 1930s was bad for him, but also good at the same time. In any case, it is very interesting that this trio of writers worked on two films that had such strong focus on invincible water masses in the same year. ""Niagara"" was the less successful from the two films. There is no awards recognition listed here for this one at all. And also don't be confused by the black-and-white screen photos on imdb, as I stated earlier it is a color film. I watched this of course on the occasion of a Marilyn Monroe retrospective and she was in her mid-20s here and thus still almost a decade away from her untimely death. In 1953 she had already slowly transformed into lead actress material, even if her glory years were still a bit away. She is also first credit here apparently, which is a bit difficult to believe as there were at least two other characters here that were more at the center of the story than her character, who seemed more on the supporting side. Big supporting admittedly, but still. She is also out of the picture quite some time before it ends. The two I am talking about are Joseph Cotton who has been in at least two pretty iconic Hollywood films from the old days and also has a star on the Hollywood Boulevard with his name and Jean Peters who also had a decent body of work, but is maybe more remembered today for being married for almost 15 years to Howard Hughes, who was of course portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Aviator"", even if Peters, or I should say her character, was not a major factor in this film and instead there was more focus on the big-name females in Hughes' life. Maybe she should have been. Anyway, this film here is among her most known and this is also thanks to Monroe mostly of course that the movie is not forgotten so many decades later. As for the rest of the cast, maybe the biggest fans of the old Hollywood days will recognize one or two or more actors, but they are not really stars by any means. Still acted in a handful of projects back then, but aside from Monroe and maybe Cotton, the big names here were the writers and perhaps the director. If you look at everybody who Monroe worked with in the 1950s, then you will also still find much bigger names behind and in front of the camera though. She was quickly beyond the people she was working with here as her stardom reached new dimensions. But the role here fits her nicely. She already has the men wrapped around her finger. This includes her lover who she convinces to kill her husband, but it also includes said husband who is pretty going crazy because of her and it is some kind of hate-love relationship. He despises her indeed, but during one scene we are also told from another character that it is just impossible for him to move on from her. Well, he manages pretty nicely I guess when he kills her then a little later, but at that point he may not be seen as total evil still because he was the first target and also managed to kill the guy who was initially coming for him. I still wonder how he knew about the bell-ringing that the two love birds agreed on that they would follow up on. The melody you hear there pretty much, even if I would not have recognized said melody if it hadn't said so in the subtitles. But it did and the more memorable scene is of course before that when the song is played or selected by Monroe when she and a few others are partying in the evening and it makes her husband also pretty angry and crazy almost. The moment when she then arrives to identify the corpse of her husband was maybe the most interesting moment of the film. There you still believe she was pretending to mourn and lose consciousness because you do not see who she was looking at and that it was really the other man, so her reaction was not staged, but actual grief and sadness there which even gave her a great alibi. Too bad her husband was out there knowing the truth or she could not know if he really knew, just that he was alive and probably had a hunch who the man was that tried to kill him. It was all about the crime element here and the suspense. I am also glad that the writers did not shy away from having Monroe killed in this scene that was more memorable than most others when her man is coming for her. No unrealistic rescue there. I will just keep going now with some brainstorming for the rest of the film in terms of what stayed in my mind here. The visual beauty was of course undeniable and I would have been totally fine with the movie scoring an Oscar nomination for the waterfall scenes. They Niagara depictions really made me wanna go there and see them live. Who knows, maybe it can happen one day. But let's not make this about me. The moment when the other woman, the actual female protagonist I would say runs into this huge coincidence there to see Monroe's character kiss her lover was perhaps not super realistic, but it was also not bad and kinda memorable from the perspective that it made Monroe's character look suspicious when she says she has nobody else to look out for her a little later when the news about her missing husband spreads. As for Peters, the aforementioned female protagonist, she gave an alright performance, but also had it easier than (the man who played) her husband if we look at how he was really only depicted as somebody who does not have a clue at all if we ignore his final comment about how the boat needs to sink. He was intended to be overshadowed by the villain protagonist the longer the film went. At the very beginning, you could still think that Max Showalter would be a lead here. How they thanked the police inspector who was portrayed by Denis O'Dea was also a bit exaggerated. I mean he did almost nothing. It is a crime suspense thriller, but the police are never a vital factor. They still had to include them for realism purposes I suppose and they did, so it is all good. As I am approaching the end of my review now, I would say that the ending there in the Niagara Falls was among the most memorable the film had to offer too, also how the bad guy makes sure the woman is alright. He is not evil. He killed the one who did all this to him, but an innocent woman he does not want to die. By the way, I must say I really, really adored Peters outfit, what she was wearing (not sure I can call it a dress, in this long final sequence from the moment onwards when she was stepping on the boat. I know there was talk about a Monroe outfit much earlier that was fairly spectacular, but I would prefer Peters' from the end anytime over that one. But yeah, the Monroe outfit, especially the metaphoric comment there about how hot it is was Monroe in a nutshell during that time and for almost all her career. Sadly, mostly reduced to her looks. I did not find her as hot and desirable here as she seemed in some of her later, actually final acting performances I must say though. Others might disagree. But they will also maybe disagree with me giving this film here a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. It is not as smart as it wants to be a times, but makes for a solid watch from beginning to end. Give it a chance I'd say and even if you don't like it, then maybe at least it will make you want to travel to Canada to see the Falls yourself."
Niagara (1953),"Well-matured, superior vintage","It is a good film - not great, but good. Colour is fantastic, of course, one of the last Fox films in the original three strip Technicolor (which apparently had compatibility problems with Cinemascope) . Compare this beauty to sleazy, cheap ugliness which passes as cinematography nowadays! And speaking about sleaze, with all the hypocrisy and racism of Code, it keeps squalid aspects of Niagara in control, so the film didn't fall (ha ha!) to the sewer. I know everyone speaks about Marilyn - and for a reason! - but it was Jean Peters heroine whose beauty impressed me as a little girl. A brunette with complexion of Technicolor roses, she is brimming with purity and good heart - idealized but never irritating. I thought Marilyn would have looked even better with different trademark look than bleached hair, ""wet"" lips, a beauty mark etc. But then I am not a man! I found Cotten's character both unnerving and sympathetic. When he accuses his wife of adultery - she is not only younger, but looks like, well, Marilyn Monroe! - I mentally prepared for violent outburst of domestic abuse. On the other hand, he has mental illness for the Korean War, his wife and her lover try to murder him, and he has no intention to harm the innocent."
Niagara (1953),Marilyn sets the screen on fire!,"Joseph Cotten is a familiar face if you've seen 'Shadow of Doubt'. I've seen this movie several times over the last twenty plus years and love it. I went to Niagara Falls as a kid and went on the various tours they go to in the movie. It's almost a time capsule movie, seeing Niagara Falls before the complete over saturation of tourist entrapment. Marilyn Monroe is a mustang sally, you're never going to slow that mustang down, and certainly never break her. Women like Rose Loomis is a single serving woman, who married a hopeless romantic George Loomis for a meal ticket and a ride. This results in a uncomfortable unhappy marriage for both, usually ending in the free spirit mustang sally looking for the bigger better cowboy to ride her. Monroe looks great in this. She really was an eye full. The movie looks great. I enjoyed the Jean Peters performance. She plays Polly the beautiful American down to earth woman. Polly is the type of woman men marry but Rose is the type men lust after. This is kind of mentioned by my favorite line in cinema, To wear a dress like that, you have to start laying plans when you're about thirteen. This was referring to a fuchsia bodycon dress Rose comes out of her room wearing. There's a great single take of Rose aka Monroe's bum as she walks out of the scene in a tight gray pencil midi skirt. The wardrobe department picked the right attire to present Marilyn at her best. This was definitely a Marilyn Monroe movie. Marilyn made a huge impact on Hollywood in the 1950s, Sandra Dee, Doris Day, Tippi Hedren, Grace Kelly. It was the era of the platinum blonde and I have to say I'm sad I couldn't have lived then."
Niagara (1953),"An outstanding noir thriller, rich and riveting","What a wonderful juxtaposition - a genre as famous for its black and white presentation as for its storytelling conventions, and a Technicolor presentation that's reliably more vibrant and fetching than what even modern film-making techniques can often claim. With this combination every scrap of the picture's terrific details pop out all the more, a real pleasure to take in as a viewer. Through Joe MacDonald's equally vivid cinematography, and director Henry Hathaway's keen eye for orchestrating arresting shots and scenes, we get lush eyefuls of the beautiful filming locations and lovely production design and art direction, to say nothing of fantastic costume design and hair and makeup work. The cast give excellent performances all around, characterized by strong, nuanced range and personality, and it's a pleasure to watch them at work. Jean Peters, Casey Adams, Joseph Cotten, and Marilyn Monroe stand out most, of course, given the most time on-screen, but the supporting actors are hardly to be counted out as the likes of Russell Collins and Don Wilson make big impressions in their own right. Slivers of film noir and mystery flavor the proceedings at various points - shady figures, dark dealings, murder most foul, events spiraling out of control - before the sharp tension and suspense of the thriller definitively take over. Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch, and Richard Breen penned an outstanding story and screenplay, giving us characters, dialogue, scene writing, and plot development that buzz with fierce energy as the tale unfolds. One doesn't always know what to expect from such fare, and not all features are made equal, but 'Niagara' firmly holds our attention all the way through. The visuals engage us first during early exposition, before the capabilities of the actors become most dominant. When at last the full force of the narrative takes over, brimming with all the potency that had been building, the result is fabulously absorbing and entertaining, and one can never be entirely sure where it's all going to end up. There's no one aspect of the movie that immediately leaps out as essential and grabbing, despite the all-around excellence. Rather, every component part and every participant on hand - writing, direction, acting, contributions from behind the scenes - help the strength of the picture to gather over its length until at last, like an inexorable current, the viewing experience is inescapably captivating. I can't remember the last time I ended up almost literally biting my nails during a film, but that's exactly the type of storytelling we get in the last minutes. I don't know if I'd say this is absolutely perfect, or an absolute must-see, yet nor can I think of any specific fault that detracts from the experience. It's quite safe to say that this earns a true blanket recommendation; anyone who enjoys entertainment media of any sort will surely find much to love about 'Niagara,' and for anyone who especially admires film noir or thrillers, there's no doing without it. I assumed I'd have a good time watching still I'm very much impressed with just how good this is. It's simply a superb title, and if you have the chance to watch, don't miss out!"
Niagara (1953),Niagara,"While on retreat in Niagara Falls, a couple's rocky marriage takes a sinister turn. We're all selfish to varying degrees but mean just wasn't in Marilyn Monroe, and because acting didn't come easy to the iconic sex symbol, watching her try to pull it off (Rose) is like biting into a ""Sugar"" free cupcake: yuck. The closest Marilyn came to playing a believable fatale was Angie, Louis Calhern's goomar in The-Asphalt-Jungle (49), and even then she was pretty much a sweetie pie: ""Haven't you bothered me enough (cop), you big banana-head!"" Directors Wilder (Some-Like-It-Hot) and Huston (Asphalt The-Misfits) saw what was inside, then cast to Monroe's strengths (warmth trust kick) to the joy of movie-goers. Just as unsettling is seeing male lead Joseph Cotten cast a cuckold (Beyond-the-Forest), something a director (Hathaway) aught never do to the iconic Holly Martins (The-Third-Man). My advice, take a pass on this depressing marital movie mess and use the time to view one of the bracketed films above (1/4)."
Niagara (1953),A Decent Alright Film,"It was an alright film, i have a decent time watching it, Monroe definitely shines every time she did her scene, and that is not without also Jean Peters pretty good performance and so do the rest of the cast, is just that there is nothing really special about it in terms of a story, it is quite a mainstream story that i was at first thought it's gonna be exciting but it was decent, a decent alright film. Imdb didn't let us making short review anymore. So i don't know what i'm gonna wrote except this and hey this included on the required characters so while i wrote this it's actually included and there you go!"
The Killing (1956),Yet another crack from Kubrick,"The Killing is such a movie guys, its quickly happening events right from the beginning of the film makes you watch it with full possible attention in order not to miss any details of the film. The multiple times he presents the 'Big day' and the 'Seventh Race' is just written very carefully. The same scene repeated on the screen gives you various perspectives to the same event. I have also seen the type of narration that Quentin Tarantino uses now, maybe he is inspired by this. To be more particular it's narration is seen the movie ""Hateful Eight"" and the screenplay sort of resembles the ""Reservoir Dogs"". My favourite scene is the climax itself, the way all that hard work is put to stake at once, also it's not Dues-ex-machina the way Kubrick uses Sebastian (the dog) to put everything upside down. 9/10."
The Killing (1956),Clever heist movie camouflaged as noir homage from the young Kubrick,"Stanley Kubrick's first major success was with this clever heist movie camouflaged as noir homage. Kubrick himself adapted Lionel White's novel ""Clean Break"" together with Jim Thompson (The Getaway), and the end result became a tight and suspenseful little film which has stood the test of time remarkably well. Even in the segments where its affinity with contemporary genre movies remain the most prevalent, such as with regards to the Sherry character, the movie has layers and nuance, not least represented through Elisha Cook's delicate George Peatty character. And the gritty, no-nonsense depiction of the crime plot gives the movie an instant appeal. The young Kubrick was equal amounts economical and visionary, which he demonstrated emphatically here on a shoestring budget in what was his first film with producer James B. Harris. They did it again a year later with the brilliant Paths of Glory. No wonder Quentin Tarantino cited The Killing as his main influence for Reservoir Dogs - they both stand as two of the best of their kind today."
The Killing (1956),Textbook Cinema,"A meticulously executed movie from start to finish. Any great film starts with a great premise and a robbery at a horse racing track, where the equine favourite needs to be shot mid-race in order for the plan to work suits me just fine. I'm actually morally against horse racing, but as an idea it's
a solid one. We get to see very believable performances from everyone involved and, although it doesn't carry in it the best acting I've ever seen in my entire life, it's pretty damn close. I found Coleen Gray's portrayal of Fay to be the most impressive. In one scene she has to filter through several contrasting emotions as the dialogue progresses and she did so in such a natural way. The most entertaining parts of the movie for me are the bar-fight with the hairy, Georgian thug employed to distract the police and, of course, the protracted ending where everything goes tits up. I think the bar-fight was excellently choreographed. I didn't know Kwariani's artistic background when I was watching the movie but knew with near-certainty that he must have had a background in professional wrestling. It really shows. As for the conclusion to the whole fiasco, it had me laughing for a solid minute. Seeing the money fluttering through the air on a windy airport runway was a splendid idea. What a perfect way to show the audience that the criminal efforts of the men and women involved were all for nothing. So why 8/10 and not 10/10? Well, just like all stories with a lot of important characters in them, you do route for various players, but never identify strongly enough with any one person. This is a story about a heist and there isn't really much room for pondering anything else, besides the differing relationship dynamics of the romantic couples. This is a genuine point of interest, but it doesn't give us reams to think about. Compare this with a noir film like Double Indemnity and it's easy, at least for me, to see why one had a greater emotional impact on me than this did, great as it undoubtedly was."
The Killing (1956),Great early Kubrick feature,"Stanley Kubrick is, of course, one of the all time greats, and a true visionary auteur of film history. Even in his early career, he could do unconventional and interesting visual works like no other -as is attested by this, apparently troubled, but in the end very satisfying production. Kubrick's flair for cinematography, cutting and editing is ever present and handled beautifully as ever, it is very finely and beautifully put together all around. The actors all do an incredible job, as one would expect, and accompines Kubrick's stellar script wonderfully. Overall, like all Kubrick films, highly recommended for any lover of film!"
The Killing (1956),A masterpiece,"The non-linear storytelling, overused nowadays even when it does not make any sense, is key to this taught thriller, narrated almost as a documentary. Besides, despite the non-linear structure, the plot is very easy to follow, thanks to the narrator who tells the audience everything from the time of the day to the details about the gang involved in the audacious heist at the races. It does't hurt that main character Johnny Clay is played by one of my favourite actors, Sterling Hayden, in a role that reminds me of his doomed character in The Asphalt Jungle. Clay is a coincise, world-wary character who planned the heist to the last detail, unfortunately missing the ""human factor"". As it's customary in stories about failed heists, there's always one detail that is either unknown or unpredictable, but important enough to wreak havoc even in the most perfect plan. Perhaps my favourite Kubrick's movie, with a tight script, excellent cast and no-nonsense approach."
The Killing (1956),A masterclass in using a non-linear narrative structure,"""The killing"" (1956) is the first real serious production of Stanley Kubrick. It is a film noir. The general opinion is that Kubrick, in this phase of his career, was a follower of genre conventions and not yet an innovator. The film is praised above all for its craftsmanship. One element that in my opinion is nevertheles innovative is the way the story (a heist on a horserace track) is told. The story is not told in chronological order but seen from the perspective of the different members of the heist-team. This means that each episode from the story is told sevaral times, but each time seen from a different perspective. Images from the horses walking to their starting position indicates that there has been a change in perspective. This way of telling a story is also used in ""Satantango"" (1994, Bela Tarr), but with a running time of 7h, 19m Tarr had all the time in the World to tell a (minimalist) story from different perspectives. In other reviews I read that Quentin Tarantino borrowed this way of telling a story from Kubrick and used it in ""Reservoir dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp fiction"" (1994). In the instance of ""The killing"" the way the story is told has a close connection with the story itself. The story is told from the perspective of the individual teammembers, but these teammembers are informed by the mastermind of the heist (Johnny Clay played by Sterling Hayden) on a strictly need to know basis. One member is told to start a quarrel at the bar just to distract the attention, and this is all he knew. One can't help to wonders if the way Johnny Clay manages the members of his heist team is not a bit like the way Stanley Kubrick manages his actors in his future films. Of course even a perfect planning (the voice over keeps giving detailed time indications) is no match for the whims of fate. At the end of the film the whims af fate appear in the form of a little dog. Curious enough I recently saw a film in which the whims of fate took the same shape (""The hidden room"", 1949, Edward Dmytryk)."
The Killing (1956),The Greatest starts his run here,"I write it every time i review one of his films. For me Kubrick is the best and for me it all starts here. It doesn't quite have all the Kubrick trademarks yet, they start to become more noticeable in Paths of Glory. This is still a good film, A heist gone wrong told from different perspectives, very similar to Reservoir Dogs. Some good twists and everything with the heist seems to go perfectly and how everyone fits in is great. One thing that shows here is great written characters. You sort of care about all of them and you want them to succeed. Except the Wife of course, you don't want her to succeed."
The Killing (1956),Wow!,"This is a great crime thriller! Sometimes crime thrillers can get overly complicated in it's plot and/or character line up, to the point where I find it a hassle to try and keep up with the storyline. However, this plot ran very smoothly and very fast! The movie starts out great and the more the story develops the more anticipation you feel. The guys have a plan and it all comes together until.. bang! I enjoyed all the characters. It's not just a bunch of grumpy old men with no personalities who just act like cool criminals. That can get boring, in my opinion. So really it's a perfect movie that gets you sweating!"
The Killing (1956),Why didn't he.....,"....take a train? I'm going through all the Kubrick's in chronological order. The previous Killer's Kiss (6/10) was a watchable but middling noir romp with a couple of strong scenes and interesting camera work. The Killing is of very similar ilk but feels like a slight upgrade: script & plot is more ambitious, camera a little more dynamic and there's a bigger cast to work with. Non-linear structure works well, you can see where Tarantino got some influence from. Acting is mostly good except for action scenes where it feels quite theatrical (typical 50's movie). The biggest weakness of the movie is that the tidy robbery plan of the script is at odds with some of the leaps of logic the viewer is asked to make: firstly there's that one absurd shootout where the door is just opened without caution, and everyone dies despite not nearly enough shooting happening. Still, this scene is just about acceptable. The 'script-killer' is the reasoning of Johnny to take a plane instead of a train or even car. This decision is inconsistent with how the movie has sold us on the logistical planning-ahead capabilities of the brains behind the plan. Going on a plane-flight with a large suitcase full of cash is clearly a dodgy idea: logically the suitcase won't typically be allowed on board and would have to be checked in. It doesn't seem correct that Johnny didn't think of this, even taking into account the unexpected event where he had to take all the cash (as the narrator told us, even this potential event was prepared for). This incompetence of the otherwise calculating Johnny Clay slightly dampens the impact of the ending when he realises the game is up (well-acted, tho'). Still, while these criticisms prevent a higher score they didn't stop me enjoying the movie: it was entertaining, interesting and nicely filmed. The many characters are well-drawn, despite their short screentimes. Kubrick famously then left the noir-crime genre to go in all kinds of different directions. The next - Paths of Glory - may thematically resemble his very first work Fear and Desire, but undoubtedly will show a significantly-improved production."
The Killing (1956),The Killing,"Though it's Sterling Hayden who takes top billing here, it's actually Marie Windsor who steals the show as ""Sherry"". She is the rather money-grabbing, bullying, wife of ""George"" (Elisha Cook Jr). Now he works in the cashier's office at the local racetrack where ""Mike"" (Joe Sawyer) works behind the bar. These two are to be lynch pins in a daring plan to rob the place of two million dollars as it's feature race brings in the punters. Ex-con ""Johnny"" (Hayden) is the brains behind the scheme that also includes a bent cop ""Randy"" (Ted de Corsia), marksman ""Nikki"" (Timothy Carey) and financier ""Unger"" (the familiar face of Jay C. Flippen). Meticulous planning is required, diversions are created and it all looks set fair. Except, that is, for the blabbermouth ""George"" who tells his wife - in a bid to retain her love for him (and money) - who proceeds to tell her lover ""Val"" (Vince Edwards) and so a bit of double-play is soon on the cards too. It's constructed almost like a jigsaw puzzle, this film. We do a little bit of work on one aspect of the story, then move timelines and/or locations to another, or to another character before it all gradually comes together delivering a really effective eighty minutes of crime drama. Although I thought the ending just a little bit of a let down, there are strong performances across this tautly directed and effectively scored story. There's quite a lively bit of action from strongman Kola Kwariani in here too that's quite entertaining. Well worth a watch."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),6.7/10. Recommended but overrated,"For reference, my ratings for some previous movies of his : NOTORIOUS 9/10 VERTIGO 8,9/10. ROPE: 8,2/10. DIAL M FOR MURDER: 8,6/10. THE 39 STEPS : 7,3/10. REAR WINDOW : 8,4/10. THE BIRDS: 7,7/10 MARNIE: 7,2/10. SPELLBOUND : 7,6/10. STRANGERS ON A TRAIN : 7,2/10. LIFEBOAT : 7,4/10. NORTH BY NORTHWEST: 8/10. REBECCA : 8,1/10 PSYCHO : 9/10 He is one of the greatest directors of all time, no doubt about it. Not every movie of his is masterpiece, some are flawed but even them are entertaining at least, and every cinephile will enjoy them. Having said that, this is his worst movie by far. I read that Hitchcock himself likes it the most. That makes no sense to me. SOAD doesn't hold a candle to his masterpieces (REBECCA, REAR WINDOW, DIAL M FOR MURDER, VERTIGO, NOTORIOUS, PSYCHO). ACTING (Joseph Cotten is laughable at times, not menacing at all). SUSPENSE (I didn't feel much tension/agony. I didn't feel anything was at stake. Last minutes were more intense, there were some good scenes but still, i couldn't tell this is a Hitchcock if i hadn't known it already). ENDING ( One of the most ridiculous endings in a movie directed by a legend). There is also a 30 years old cop that wants to marry an underage girl. Maybe that was something common these years. Still, it was disgusting. There are some positives though. Besides Cotten, it's a well acted movie. Story is interesting and the way it unfolds, makes it even more intriguing. It doesn't drag, there are some good scenes. It's a decent and watchable psychological drama/thriller. If there was not Hitchcock name here, i would probably be more generous. But i am puzzled over Hitchcock statement. Why did a genious like him consider this movie as his favorite? This is not a very good movie."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Top-flight Hitchcock,"""Shadow Of A Doubt"" is one of those personal, small-scale, sharply observed, psychologically focused Alfred Hitchcock films which tend to be among his best (""Sabotage"", ""Suspicion"", ""Rope"", etc.). It is largely a coming-of-age (or rather, a rude awakening) story, and Teresa Wright gives an utterly captivating performance. Joseph Cotten is also excellent, and they are backed by a vivid supporting cast (that little girl Ann has some wondrous line readings) and equally vivid small-town atmosphere. The library sequence, and particularly the moment when Wright discovers the truth on a newspaper and the waltz music blasts through, is among the most brilliant, and most chilling, of his entire career. ***1/2 out of 4."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Hitchcocks dark joke about small town hypocrisy.,"Satire or noir? Mystery or drama? Character study or social commentary? Which one? Actually Shadow of a doubt is all of these in Hitchcocks dark masterpiece
This film is so dark, so clever, so subtle that we don't always realise it's dark. Few films are as clever as this. Few films are so heavy hitting without ever landing a punch
Joseph Cotton is one of my favourite actors. His laid back natural style is perfect for this film. Teresa is enthralling as we see her innocence transformed into weariness. She ages decades in days. Uncle Charlie has contempt for the world. It's a joke to him. Uncle Charlie has the last laugh. Hitchcock has the last word. One question remains for myself. Is Shadow of of a doubt, hitchcocks cruelest joke of all?"
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Thoroughly enjoyable 1940s thriller.....,"Young Charlie's dull life is turned upside down by the arrival of her favourite Uncle who comes to lodge with her family. Charlie quickly notices though that something is not quite right and her Uncle may well be running as his past catches up with him. The film deserves strong praise, especially for its casting and score. Cotton plays his role with that great combination of charm and menace which a sociopaths often display. The score, direction and cinematography are also very memorable and well thought through. As well as tension and suspense the film also employs a little comic relief - with the father and his brother in law regularly debating the best way in which they'd murder each other. Little do they know their guest is much more than he seems. Charlie is our protagonist a lively, very intelligent but high strung girl who's little world is turned on it's head, not only by the arrival her favourite uncle but also by a rather handsome young man who says he's working on a ""census"" in the town and selects her family due to their ""averageness."" The film's location was also one of it's strongpoints and should be an example to young film makers that you don't need exotic sets and locations to create an amazing story. Just like Rear Window quite of a lot of this film takes place in an ordinary home with a rather extraordinary secret. Psycho too also had a simple setting of a motel for one the best horror films in cinema. Charlie is portrayed as a dark haired, wide eyed, caring and idealistic young lady, a real departure from Hitchock's usual blond young female character who's usually cycnical, emotionally resilient and very Blasé. I really loved Charlie's charaterisation, she felt like a throwback to a simpler, dreamier, less demanding time. Her mother too is a very gentle, sweet and affectionate, a woman who adores her family above all else. Set firmly in the 1940s the men of the town go about their business while the women stay at home, the father is a banker, the love interest is a ""government employee"" and the uncle is said to be involved in some form of business, in the words of his sister something ""far too complex for her to understand."" Charlie has finished high school but there's no suggestion that she might be looking for a job, instead it seems a marriage proposal is the much more likely thing on the cards for her. The town itself also has a nice, warm, safe, old fashioned feel to too, the church, the library, the local bar where soldiers on leave can drink and be merry, everywhere feels bright and happy. There's even a local policeman who knows everybody's name. The town feels like the last place in the world where a murder might be lurking. I did have a couple of gripes with the film though. Charlie's curiosity and intelligence felt to me slightly undermined at the end where after two attempts at having her murdered she still allows herself to be alone with her uncle yet again. I thought in the final scene maybe she'd made arrangements with the police and they would obviously appear from cover and arrest him on the train showing that she'd set him up, but no. I can only really put her behaviour down to her naivety and fear of upsetting her mother, no person of normal intelligence would surely go anywhere another person who'd over the last couple of days twice tried to kill them. Also I was unclear why the Uncle decided the best thing was to kill Charlie, surely her death would only cast further suspicion on himself?"
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),The battle of the two Charlie's,"(1943) Shadow of a Doubt
PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE THRILLER At the opening has a elderly lady being strangled to death, viewers are unable to make out who the killer might be. Meanwhile, from a different city, Santa Rosa , California, a teenager, Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton (Teresa Wright), has just been informed her favorite uncle, Charles ""Uncle Charlie"" Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is stopping by for a visit. And by the time he shows up, everything is okay, until Charlie is stopped and informed by nearby Detective Jack Graham (MacDonald Carey) that her uncle may be a killer. And it was at this point she starts snooping. Serial killer movie Hitchcock style, the other one is ""Frenzy"" which I did not enjoy too much. It becomes interesting when viewers witness the battle of the two Charlie's to see which one will crack and bend over backwards."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Teresa Wright is fantastic!,"""Shadow of a Doubt,"" directed by the iconic Alfred Hitchcock, is a cinematic gem that continues to captivate audiences with its suspenseful storytelling and remarkable performances. At the heart of this classic thriller is Teresa Wright, whose exceptional acting adds depth and authenticity to the film. Teresa Wright's portrayal in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a testament to her immense talent as an actress. Her ability to embody the character of young Charlie is nothing short of remarkable. Wright brings a perfect blend of innocence and curiosity to her role, making the audience feel a deep connection with her character and a genuine concern for her well-being. One of the most outstanding aspects of Teresa Wright's performance is the emotional depth she brings to her character. As the story unfolds, Wright masterfully conveys a range of emotions, from the initial excitement and adoration for her Uncle Charlie, played by Joseph Cotten, to the growing suspicion and fear as the plot thickens. Her subtle expressions and nuanced performance create an atmosphere of tension and suspense, characteristic of Hitchcock's finest works. Wright's on-screen chemistry with Joseph Cotten is worth noting, as their interactions are filled with complexity and intrigue. The dynamic between their characters is essential to the film's success, and Teresa Wright's ability to hold her own alongside such a seasoned actor is a testament to her incredible talent. In ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" Teresa Wright's performance is truly outstanding, and it is a crucial element in the film's enduring appeal. Her portrayal is a powerful reminder of the impact a gifted actor can have on a classic film. Whether you are a fan of Hitchcock's suspenseful storytelling or a connoisseur of timeless cinema, Wright's performance in ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a must-see. It showcases her exceptional talent and adds an unforgettable dimension to a film that continues to stand the test of time."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),I have more than a shadow of a doubt about the film script,"Nobody seems quite sure why Alfred Hitchcock considered this piece of hokum to be his favorite film. As contemporary film critic Bosley Crowther pointed out, the film lacked any sudden twist in the plot; from the outset we know that Charlie Oakley is a shady character, the early suspense lies in wondering how and when the young & innocent Charlotte Newton will get wise to him. Shadow of a Doubt invites comparisons to Hitch's most commercially successful movie - Psycho. In both movies somebody is on the lam, with $40,000 ill-gotten dollars, and moves to a small, sleepy, California town. Shadow of a Doubt lacks Psycho's two vital plot twists (within 40 minutes it turns out that the film isn't really about Marion Crane, it's about Norman Bates; it later turns out that Norman's mother isn't the evil murderer, it's Norman himself). Shadow of a Doubt's main weakness is its underwhelming climax. The audience is asked to believe that in the final struggle, a teenage girl would be capable of overpowering a 36-year-old man and pushing him out of a moving train. It may be a historical fact that US President Theodore Roosevelt practiced judo in 1902, but it would be most unlikely that a young Charlie Oakley would have been able to enroll at a local woman's judo club in California in 1941; the boom in American judo didn't start until post-WW2. I had to laugh at the scene where Charlotte arrives at the library at one minute past nine and the librarian lets her in for ""just 3 minutes"". It's my experience of librarians that they are about as flexible as cast iron; I'd have a better shot at sneaking into the bullion depository at Fort Knox than persuading my local librarian to let me see one of her newspapers after closing time! Around the time this movie was made, a Brit named John Haigh was embarking on his career as a serial killer of wealthy women. Haigh's modus-operandi would have fascinated Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn's loveable character), Haigh dissolved the bodies of his victims in baths of sulfuric acid. Alas, John Haigh wasn't caught until 1949, too late for Hitch to use the story in his movie (and perhaps too gruesome for the Hays Code to have allowed anyway). A glaring plot inconsistency is Charlie Oakley's attempts to eliminate Charlotte in ways rigged to look like an accident; if the broken step or the monoxide-filled garage are such great strategies, why didn't Charlie Oakley contrive to murder those wealthy widows in ways that would look like accidents? Strangulation is so obvious during a post-mortem."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),shadow of a doubt,"Hitchcock's first great American film and his personal fave of all his work, ""Shadow"" is actually a fairly atypical offering from this lively but grim director. It is not particularly suspenseful, a la ""Notorious"" or ""North By Northwest"". It is not gruesome like ""Psycho"" or tongue in cheek/gruesome like ""Rear Window"". It does not flat out terrify you like ""The Birds"". And it is certainly not as interestingly sick and twisted as ""Vertigo"" or ""Strangers On A Train"". What it is is a rather quiet, brooding study of the clash of good and evil in a small town that is completely and utterly captivating. Your backside may not be on the edge of the seat but your eyes will certainly be glued to the screen. Three performances stand out. In ascending order let us begin with Patricia Collinge as Uncle Charlie's emotionally fragile sister. Through this sensitive portrayal emerges not only great psychological damage but, for me at least, intimations of incest, as well. Then there is Joseph Cotten's acute study in moral deadness as the idealized Uncle Charley. From the first time we see this awful fellow, lying fully clothed, cigar in mouth, on top of his cheap rooming house bed, staring vacantly at the ceiling, and hear his monotonal, utterly lifeless ""Come in"" when his landlady knocks we understand that Charley Oakley is a person who long ago checked out of life and now it's just a matter of burying the corpse before it can do further damage. Finally, and most compellingly, there is Teresa Wright's amazingly good turn as Charlie's first adoring, then appalled niece, the good to his evil. It is never easy to play Good, especially intelligent good as called for here, and avoid falling into the twin traps of sentimentality and smugness. That Wright does so triumphantly not only gives this movie its strong moral center but is also, in my opinion, evidence for this being the best female acting job in a Hitchcock film (with apologies to all you Bergman, Fontaine, Kelly or Novak fans out there). Three relatively minor complaints. They are: 1)Two comic relief scenes with Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn is one too many. 2) The child actor playing Wright's sister is so annoying that I kinda wished Cotten had detoured from his usual matronly victims to throttle the brat. 3) Macdonald Carey is one dull actor. Reminds me of someone who does a lot of public service ads. Bottom line: Liked it better than ""Our Town"". Give it an A minus."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Never Doubt on Hitchcock,"This one takes a little while to get going. The audience knows that Charlie Oakley is up to something, but we aren't quite sure what. This intrigue stretches to about 10 minutes before the runtime justifies it to stretch. Once the director shows all his cards, that is when the movie gets really good. There is a secret that Charlie Newton, Taresa Wright, knows about Charlie Oakley, Joseph Cotten, and that is where the real intrigue and suspense kicks in. Hitchcock is under appreciated as a comedic director. There are a lot of funny exchanges and situations that go in this film. You can't go wrong with Hitchcock, his suspensful writing makes the movie just as entertaining today as it was back in the 1940's. If you like good suspense, there is absolutely no doubt that you will enjoy this one."
Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Rather over rated,"The first time I saw this film years ago it seemed to be a little strange. Now that I can see it with a clear eye it is really a problem. There is a great lack of logic to most of it. The opening shot is somewhere but we aren't told where. Charlie manages to outwit the men looking for him but who don't have a clue as to why they are even looking for him. The movie moves to Santa Rosa shown as an idyllic small town. The fact that the film was shot during the war doesn't seem to enter into it. There are signs in the band to buy war bonds, and when Charlie takes Charlie to the bar a number of service men enter. Even so, the family is doing pretty well. The have big meals and drive everywhere despite the war time rationing. For a teller in a bank, the old man manages to own a home, take care of a wife and 3 kids and welcome a guest who might stay indefinitely. Teresa Wright is just wonderful and she always is. Cotton is classic case of bad acting and bad casting. The two smaller children are just in the way and most of their chatter can't be heard. In fact, during many of the meals it seemed to be important to have characters talking over each other. This is getting too long. What public library is open until 9 PM on a weeknight. How could Charlotte know that a single article, in a local paper, without mentioning his name was about her dear uncle.? The ruse of having the ""detectives"" follow a man who they've never seen, don't know his name and have no description of across the country is pretty lame. Finally, comes the end. Charlie is leaving town. His niece thinks she knows something about him but promises she won't tell. Charlie seems to have hooked up with a new widow victim. Now, why does he suddenly need to off his niece? And the sight of a 5'3 slight teenage girl tripping up a 6'3 adult man is pretty silly. And the whole town is crying over someone who had been there just a few weeks. It was a great idea but it was concocted in a silly way. And don't forget the shots of people in Victorian garb dancing to waltz every now and then."
Out of the Past (1947),From Marx to Freud,"Gone are the basically good boys from the slums, whose crimes were trying to escape from poverty. After the war and the economic boom which followed, the new archetypical criminal was an entrepreneur, who tried, but would fail, to escape his own past. As Freud showed, our early childhood experiences were largely determinative, unless, perhaps, we could liberate ourselves through self-consciousness. In film noir, the onscreen narration is a kind of monologue from the psychiatrist's couch. Beautifully directed and photographed by Jacques Tourneur and Nicholas Musuraca, this is a paradigmatic film noir with three dames (Huston, Greer, and Fleming) and four hoods (Mitchum, Brodie, Valentine and Douglas) to keep us involved with Daniel Mainwaring's complex, involving plot."
Out of the Past (1947),Hits On All Eight Noir Cylinders,"One sure fire way to deliver a never miss noir is adapting a solid story (Build My Gallows High) by a renowned hard-boiled author (Geoffrey Homes) and sticking close to the source material. Of course it was helped by Homes being hired on to adapt his story for the screen. Much like the Maltese Falcon and The Asphalt Jungle, where the book's narrative fabric is saved word for word in the script, the story is lifted from the stilted dialogue in far too many noirs. Any hint of this being run of the mill drama is further elevated by a stellar cast. Mitchum personifies a conflicted noir lead (as he does effortlessly in his other noir work.) Jane Greer may have been new to star billing, but she dishes out her devious femme fatale lines as she plays Mitchum for a sucker. At the same time she must also sidestep Kirk Douglas, her criminal boss. He is terrific despite this being one of his first meaningful roles. It's clear he's going to be an important piece of Hollywood's future. Rhonda Fleming has a small, but crucial role as another in Douglas's harem of conniving women. She shows her chops as a less prominent femme fatale in this story and it's a shame that she wasn't cast in a lead role in other noir of the period. This film is the epitome of Noir and must be at the top of any such list."
Out of the Past (1947),Confusing Film,"I've seen this film twice, and still don't know what it's about. So many unanswered questions. Mitchum and his girlfriend are in love, so why does he get involved with Jane Greer, who was above average in looks, but no raving beauty? The most attractive woman in the film was Rhonda Fleming, who had a minor role. People go to bed and leave the outside door to their bedroom unlocked. Who does that? Mitchum comes through the patio door into Greer's bedroom while she's sleeping. She wakes up. Is she startled? Does she scream? No, she looks at him and starts a conversation with no emotion. Another time, Mitchum slips into a house while a party is going on and searches a room. The phone in the room rings. Does he leave or hide? No, he just shrugs and keeps searching, as if he didn't care that someone would come in to answer the phone and see him. And what's with all the non-stop smoking in every scene? Was the film sponsored by a tobacco company? Characters did things that no one would do. Greer mentions a bar to him at their first, brief meeting. He goes to that bar everyday and sits for hours waiting for her to return. Why? Is he in love with her already? What makes him think she'll come back? Why didn't she just say when and where she'd see him again? How come after his first meeting with Jane Greer he forgot all about the woman he was going to marry? Was there any significance to the boy being a deaf mute? How come Kirk Douglas lost his girlfriend and $40,000 but it didn't seem to bother him much? You need to watch this film with pen and paper handy so you can write down your questions. Then watch it again and see if you can find answers. That's a lot of work for something that's supposed to be an enjoyable hour and a half."
Out of the Past (1947),Only Burt Lancaster was missing,"I always confound this movie with I WALK ALONE, also starring Kirk Douglas but co starring Burt Lancaster instead of Bob Mitchum. Same kind of story and atmosphere and directed by a non film noir specialist - Byron Haskin for I WALK ALONE and Jacques Tourneur, film noir specialist neither, concerning OUT OF THE PAST. So, yes, I would have imagined Burt Lancaster with Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. I think Mitchum never co starred Lancaster. Maybe I am wrong though. But this film, despite the fact it was made by a horror thriller specialist, is a true tour de force in terms of everything: camera work, story telling, acting. And I won't even speak of Jane Greer whose presence is her most powerful in her career. And the terrific last scene, where the young deaf mute lies to Robert Mitchum's sweet heart, when she asks him if he left her for running away with Jane Greer; he says yes - a lie of course - so that she forgets him for good and can be happy with another man. This sequence reminds me Jean Pierre Melville's LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE, when Paul Meurisse, in the end, tells Christine Fabrega that Lino Ventura did not ask about her before he died...A true lie to help her forgetting him."
Out of the Past (1947),Mitchum might have inspired hundreds of pulp fiction writers,Considered to be one of the greatest noir films. I think its damn good with some really hot ladies like Jane Greer. But I guess it was Mitchum who cemented his place as the face of film noir with the role of Jeff Bailey. I can imagine writers of pulp fiction basing their characters on Mitchum's persona. Out of the Past is a pretty straightforward noir story. A man who wants to settle down with small town girl gets pulled back into his past involving a sexy femme fatale and his old boss. Some men just get attracted to the wrong women and cannot contain themselves even if the lady might completely destroy their life. (8/10)
Out of the Past (1947),solid film noir with nice scenery,"Movie is stylish, and compelling, with twists and turns, and one extended flashback that keeps the viewer offguard. Which is what happens to Robert Mitchum's detective. He is smart, direct, and always one step ahead of everyone, except for the matters of the heart. Which catches him offguard. Enter the stunning Jane Greer, who changes Mitchum's life. Their relationship makes this movie worthwhile. Kirk Douglas brings charming menace to his supporting role. And for a film noir, it was nice to see scenic mountains, forests, lakes, beaches, with picturesque trips to Mexico, LA, San Francisco, and other rural California locales. Did I mention how attractive Jane Greer is ? It's no wonder Mitchum falls so fast, and so blindly in love."
Out of the Past (1947),""".......That's one way to be clever. Act like an idiot.""","Director Jacques Tourneur brought a touch of Gallic finesse to his Hollywood films whilst inheriting the visual sense of his father Maurice. It must be said that for certain vehicles notably 'Great Day in the Morning' and 'The Flame and the Arrow', one could have done with a little less finesse and a little more force but he was in his element with dark dramas and for this viewer at any rate 'Out of the Past' remains his masterpiece. Adapted from his own novel 'Build my Gallows high' by blacklisted writer Daniel Mainwaring under the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes, the plethora of marvellous one-liners have been contributed by collaborators Frank Fenton and a certain James M. Cain. Even by the standards of the time this is superb Film Noir in which Tourneur has the services of his favoured cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, a master of light and shadow and composer Roy Webb whose unobtrusive score enhances the visuals without assailing the senses. Despite the leisurely pacing the film never drags and editor Samuel Beetley said of the director ""he never returned to the same camera angles when intercutting scenes"". Robert Mitchum, described perfectly by Roger Ebert as having ""the presence of a violent man wrapped in indifference"", is ideally cast an an existential anti-hero whilst typically of this genre, the characters played by Jane Greer and Rhonda Fleming prove themselves 'more deadly than the male'. Still playing the villain at this stage of his career is Kirk Douglas whose depiction of understated menace here is extremely effective. This splendid piece comes from an era when the principle of 'little is good, less is better' prevailed. Elements sadly lacking in Taylor Hackford's convoluted version from 1984."
Out of the Past (1947),Convoluted Mess,"Why does Kathy want to kill Fisher? What's so crooked about Jeff's past that he needs a pseudonym? Why is he drawn to murderer Kathy when he's got a beautiful girlfriend he loves already? Et Cetera. And there are SO many more. Good direction and screenplay writing means we can FOLLOW WHAT'S HAPPENING! Not here, kids! And the smallest bit of research on this film turns up many more reviewers who found it the same confusing-impossible-to-follow tale as well. Perhaps if you can muster viewing this one half-a-dozen times you'll get it; but I don't have half-a-dozen times. I found a lot of noir cliches, etc.....maybe that's why the noir crowd is so drawn to this (?)."
Out of the Past (1947),My Masterpiece number 105!!,"Seminal top notch Noir from RKO that wasn't beaten till now, we could be on equal footing, however so many can match as ""Out of the Past"" in structure, smart dialogues, scheming, story femme fatale, photograph and storyline told by flashbacks also the qualified casting just named a few adjectives, including direction of the tight hands of master Jacques Tourneau, underrated by the way, assuredly this picture became Robert Mitchum's trademark acting for good with the cigarrete on the mouth and that shapel and the cloak.

Out of the Past (1947),unbelievable,"Inplausable scenario and situations. The most wooden performances I've ever seen. The terrible script is only superceded by the worst acting in a movie I can remember. The plot moves at a hundred miles an hour. Fans will probably say it's so complex you have to see it twice to understand it but that just means it's badly written. I just don't see any redeeming qualities here. The soundtrack was cliché for it's time but not terrible I suppose. The movie looked good. I'm reaching to find anything good to say. I haven't the slighest idea why this movie not only gets a decent score, let alone be seen as a classic? Jeesh."
Laura (1944),One you can skip.,"A really horrible film, the script is just terrible. It's the kind of film which wants you to think it's got these great stakes but in reality it's got nothing of the kind. The dialogue is as cliched as anything you could write down, I was shocked to read this was considered a classic. One character in particular was instantly annoying, I don't know what they were thinking in creating him, he just comes off as bitter, cynical, needy and obsessive. In reality no young woman would go within a hundred miles of a man like this. Take my advice and stay well clear of this movie. It's completely overrated."
Laura (1944),View it several times and patterns start to show.,"Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a self-centered writer is having his lunch interrupted by a young lady Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) who is soliciting his endorsement of a pen. He takes her under his wing and grooms her for corporate greatness. Later it looks like someone has bumped off Laura. Detective Lt. Mark McPherson is assigned to the case. Somewhere in the process of investigation he seems to have fallen in love with the dead Laura and wants to buy her portrait. Can we figure out who did it before Mark figures it out? This movie is all that they say it in and then some. Naturally, it is not the book ""Laura"" by Vera Caspary. And due to media constraints, some things are implied. The characters do not match the book description. They could not get a good portrait of Gene Tierney for the picture of Laura so they used a photograph and made it look like a portrait. I wonder where that photograph is today. First time viewing gives you the impression that Waldo Lydecker, is a manipulative person. Yes, I know most of the characters are manipulative. But second time viewing, low and behold; who manipulates Waldo from the very beginning and uses his connections to climb the corporate ladder? Then pretty much snubs him. It was interesting to see Vincent price play a character (Shelby Carpenter) that is not in a spook movie. Look how confident Dana Andrews as Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, is in this movie. Also, notice his high heel shoes. See him as a completely different character in ""In Harm's Way"" (1965), as Admiral 'Blackjack' Broderick. Also directed by Otto Preminger."
Laura (1944),"Stiff and lifeless, like Tierney's acting","Gene Tierney plays a painting on the wall. Oh, wait, she's actually in this movie. Oddly enough, the painting shows more life than the actual actress does. Wally Lydecker, the newspaper hack played by Montgomery Burns, er, Clifton Webb spends a lot of screen time either narrating flashbacks or serving as an excuse for exposition. His barbs aren't clever or funny. Vincent Price is the romantic lead. Let that sink in for a moment. Dana Andrews starts out strongly. A full movie where he's always the lead character, investigating the death of a beautiful woman, might have worked. But too often he's pushed into the background listening to other characters yackety yacking. Or he's staring at a painting of Laura. The direction is stagebound and remarkable only for its complete lack of imagination. This movie got on my nerves early and my thumb hovered over the delete button from about the 15-minute mark."
Laura (1944),"Pretty, but doesn't live up to hype","This isn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't rate it as a great one. It had so much promise - standout cast, great director, beautiful cinematography and score, but it just seemed too far fetched in many aspects and sadly, boring. I didn't get the whole obsession Dana Andrews has for Laura based on her portrait. She is beautiful, but, come on. As others have pointed out he practically moves in to the murder victim's apartment, drinks her booze while he's there, and seems to have no idea of procedure or even manners. The whole movie was sadly flat for me. I don't get the obsession, and there are far better movies out there. Should you see it? Yes. Will you want to rewatch it? Probably not."
Laura (1944),"The ultimate film noir, expertly cast","1944's ""Laura"" was the culmination of twists and turns as numerous as those depicted on screen, producer Otto Preminger taking over for original director Rouben Mamoulian to recast the characters in a more realistic fashion (""Rouben only knows nice people""), resulting in the ultimate example of film noir. Gene Tierney was just on the cusp of stardom, ready to move on from the mostly exotic roles she had been playing, and reflecting the melancholy she felt over her newborn daughter's disabilities. Dana Andrews would be typecast in tough guy roles, his detective's growing obsession over the subject of a murder investigation revealing cracks in his facade. Vincent Price always cited this to be his best film, as a weak willed, opportunistic gigolo who reeks of insincerity, depending on the financial support of society matron Judith Anderson (Reginald Gardiner was first considered for the role). But the surprising standout in still Clifton Webb, making his comeback in Hollywood after 20 uninterrupted years of stage work, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the same part that won George Sanders an Oscar for 1950's ""All About Eve,"" the late Alexander Woollcott the inspiration behind his sharp tongued theater critic with his overbearing manner. Preminger was no stranger to low life heels, and capitalized on this success with the Dana Andrews follow up ""Fallen Angel,"" Linda Darnell the femme fatale. David Raskin's haunting theme earned lyrics by Johnny Mercer that were never heard in the picture itself, becoming one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century. All these elements came together in extraordinary ways to produce a unique, one of a kind entry that keeps viewers enthralled time after time, a high water mark in the careers of all those involved."
Laura (1944),A Noir Classic from when Hollywood Could Make Excellent Films,"I've never reviewed a noir 1940's Hollywood film before, because they were either absolute rubbish or not worth bothering with. However I jumped into this film out of curiosity as I'd read interesting reports about how unique it was with its accompanying haunting music. I certainly wasn't disappointed. This film reflects a time when Hollywood boasted the best Producers, Directors and Screenwriters outside Europe. The Actors oozed professionalism, talent and a charm seldom seen today. It's undoubtedly a film which will stay with us for generations to come and with every good reason. It's quality."
Laura (1944),Only one thing bothered me,"Truly a fantastic flick. Makes me want to pick up the book, actually. Especially because it was almost perfect. The performances were all good, the ending like a bolt that struck home. The only nagging thing, for me, was that I didn't actually see the actor falling in love with Laura as he worked the case, and that'd the bloody tag line. It honestly felt like a light switch. The internal processes, I'd hope would be in the book, probably illuminate a lot about that specific arc. Then again, in classic noir, large melodramatic swings are sort of the name of the game. Maybe it's supposed to be shocking when the words drop. I'm not sure. Either way, well worth a watch, of course. Only thing that needled me, really."
Laura (1944),One of the best films of the 1940s. The definitive film noir.,"I love this film. It's one of the best films of the 1940s and one of the best film noirs ever made. The acting is first rate and Gene Tierney is absolutely gorgeous. The plot is a basic whodunit with a police detective trying to find out to killed the young socialite Laura. He finds himself falling in love with the deceased, but that's all I'll say about the plot. Despite knowing the ending, this film stands up to repeat viewings because of the sharp dialogue. The highlight of the film is the theme by David Raskin. Even though the theme is repeated throughout, I never get tired of it. Gene Tierney is fabulous but really the standout acting belongs to the supporting cast including Clifton Webb, a young Vincent Price, and Judith Anderson. The acting, dialogue and mystery will keep you entertained throughout. A must see film!"
Laura (1944),Laura review,"Tough New York detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of advertising executive Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Laura is loved by men and admired or envied by women, and it is up to McPherson to sift through her relationships to try to piece together the puzzle. As he investigates her private affairs through witness testimony and private documents, he finds himself falling in love with the idea and essence of Laura. When a surprise visitor arrives at Laura's apartment a few days into the investigation, the case is turned on its head and the plot thickens. There is no denying the film's glossy production values. Excellent camera-work moves smoothly through gorgeous sets, snappy dialogue is present throughout, and it is generally timed and directed with precision. The film won the Oscar in 1945 for cinematography, beating Wilder's superbly shot Double Indemnity, and it also picked up nominations for ""best supporting actor"", ""best screenplay"" and the archaic and oddly specific ""best art direction- interior decoration, Black-and-White"". Preminger also received a nomination for Best Director alongside Hitchcock and Wilder (Leo McCarey ultimately took the statue home in one of many errors in judgment by the Academy). On a technical level Laura cannot be criticised by anyone but the most pedantic of viewers. The screenplay is the main thrust of a film of this type though, and although it generally delivers, it also hits a couple of bum notes. Detective McPherson is essentially an extension to the audience in the first half of the film, and he speaks to characters the viewers want to speak to, and asks the questions they want asked. The plot is teasingly unveiled, with just enough information to keep you guessing, and little enough to preseve the mystery. Just when you think you are figuring something out, another twist sheds a whole new light on things. Unfortunately though, it's a bit too clever for it's own good, and takes a few liberties to recover - ones which are deal-breakers in my opinion. I do not want to spoil the plot too much for anyone that hasn't seen this yet, but I baulked when McPherson - completely unprompted and without motive - knew exactly where the obscurely hidden murder weapon was. It was as if he had suddenly developed x-ray vision. Hints were subliminally suggested to the audience earlier in the film, but there really was no way the detective could have known about it. There were a couple of other issues that I cannot really discuss in great detail without spoilers - for example an emotional level to a relationship that seems to develop in a blink of an eye. I can't say any more, but there are other flaws if you are keeping a close eye on the plot developments. I am all for a little suspension of disbelief in movies, but for a film that requires such concentration on the character and plot developments, sloppy plot-holes and a moment of Deus ex Machina should not have existed, and this left a nasty taste in my mouth. The two main stars of the film, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews put in great performances, especially Andrews as the shrewd detective. The same cannot be said for supporting actor Vincent Price. It probably doesn't help that his character is a bumbling idiot, but Price delivers the lines in a very stagey, slightly awkward way and was a bit of an ambience breaker. I'm a fan of Price's later work, but his inexperience shows here."
Laura (1944),Andrews & Preminger begin,"Dana Andrews as Det. Lt. Mark McPherson has fallen in love with a ghost, kind of, and that's not to be spoiled for anyone who hasn't seen LAURA with its particular dreamlike camera panning from a sleeping McPherson, and we get the murderous yarn, spun all over again in a different fashion and with a twist that could be something else entirely as our hero deals with two creeps connected with the ingenue: especially a cerebral ""sugar daddy"" in a sophisticated Clifton Webb... Word is the producer frowned on this important casting because of... well... what's pretty apparent about the futzy fella, and he can't shake that aspect from his character of a character, Waldo Lydecker. But Webb is perfect as LAURA seems to be the only girl who can rid the sophisticated and manipulative Lydecker from his daily uptight uptown lunch, all by himself with a contented life all mapped-out... She has that kind of magic on everyone... Even a non-scary turn for who'd become the Master of Horror ranging for many decades, Vincent Price as a passive/aggressive rich kid turned pointless loser, Shelby Carpenter... And he's loathed by the pompous Waldo, who actually has a platonic yet obsessive relationship with Laura, and his attraction is also the funniest... and his one-liners and hatred for everyone expect the title character is a real hoot, especially how he pokes fun at Price's flaky Playboy and Andrews' Alpha Male cop. The thing is, if either of these guys were more manly, and fit Tierney like the intentionally loose glove sliding through the first half's flashbacks, then we wouldn't need that brash, tough guy Detective beyond the investigation. Ironically, he's the only one who wasn't part of her real life, and perhaps should have been. A secret only partially revealed in a movie that actually improves after perpetual expository from Webb's snooty yet hilarious jerk... All the while, LAURA morphs from a casual talky melodrama into the pure Noir Classic it's known and beloved for... Yet what really makes the film shine is the creative way Otto Preminger makes the entire movie feel almost like a dream, when it's anything but. And deep down, past even the shadowy Noir genre, this is a character-study like no other: how a woman, living or dead, can effect three men, and how they in turn effect her... means everything."
Lured (1947),"good, colorful thriller","In ""Lured"", a young taxi dancer learns that her friend has probably been killed by a serial killer preying on pretty women. Bravely, she helps out the police by responding to a series of ads in the ""Personal"" column, one of which may have been posted by the murderer. (Talk about a ""Make peace with your Creator"" assignment.) The movie follows the courageous young woman around as she meets with a succession of more or less disquieting men, including a fashion designer stricken with madness. ""Lured"" boasts a nicely twisty plot with plenty of clues and red herrings. Touches of wit and absurdity provide a counterweight to the violence. Other charms include good casting and good acting. The undisputed star of the show is Lucille Ball, who plays the brave and spirited protagonist. The women's costumes are particularly fine, ranging from everyday working outfits over star-spangled party gowns to monumental wedding dresses inspired by a bygone era. In ""Lured"", a man dabbles in personal ads in order to kill. ""Hunting lonely people looking for romance"" is a classic thriller theme that has inspired numerous books and movies. Viewers who'd like to see another exploration of the theme might take a look at the ""Murder most English"" series. (Wrote a small review there only recently.) Some of the episodes deal with the files of a posh matrimonial agency getting mined for decidedly non-matrimonial purposes."
Lured (1947),"Never knew this Hitchcock side of Douglas Sirk. He lured me, alright.","Lured (1947) :
Brief Review - Never knew this Hitchcock side of Douglas Sirk. He lured me, alright. I thought Sirk cinema meant soap, drama and romance, and he just destroyed my notion with his thriller noir Lured. I'll be glad to see more surprises from his filmography on my watchlist. Lured is your substitute version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946), with an obsessive and psychotic killer playing the main antagonist. The film tells the story of a bar girl who is hired by the cops to find a homicidal psycho on a killing spree. Since she is young and beautiful, and that's what the killer is attentive to, the woman is sent on night dates/interviews to find out who that killer is. During the process, she meets a handsome, rich man and falls in love with him. Just as they are about to be married, she is exposed to several shocking pieces of evidence that tear them apart. Now here the film loses its grip on suspense. The identity of the killer is revealed too early. They should have kept it a secret until the last scene so that it would have worked as a suspense thriller. Despite this loose corner, the film keeps you engaged and very interested in the narrative. Maybe it was Sirk's idea to make things more in the film noir zone than the Hitchcock type of suspense thriller. It works both ways; it's just a matter of your choice. Lucille Ball is the shining star here. She looks breathtaking, beautiful, and extremely gorgeous in every scene and the dialogue delivery is very exciting. Boris Karloff's cameo is a perfect example of putting the legacy in the right direction. Charles Coburn couldn't go wrong with any role any day; George Sanders gets the character right; and Sir Cedric Hardwicke may surprise you. Overall, Douglas Sirk has made an immensely busy film in suitable manners, and he actually understood the genre, which was contrary to his kind of filmmaking. RATING - 7/10* By - #samthebestest."
Lured (1947),Flowers Of Evil...,"LURED is a highly entertaining, sometimes suspenseful, crime drama. Lucille Ball stars as a dance hall girl who becomes an undercover operative for Scotland Yard, out to track down a psychopath known as ""The Poetry Killer"". Ms. Ball is very good in her sleuthing role, in spite of it being a bit far-fetched. She gets a chance for more serious moments, as well as some humorous dialogue. George Sanders is his usual suave self as Robert Fleming, and George Zucco gets to play one of the best characters of his career as Officer Barrett. He gets to be dryly hilarious. Special mention goes to Boris Karloff as the bizarre Charles van Druten. His cameo is one of the best parts of the movie! This is a mostly forgotten film that deserves rediscovery..."
Lured (1947),Early Sirk noir with comic touches stars Lucy,"Just before she moved on to radio and then TV, Lucille Ball starred in this terrific remake of a French 'policier'. Her unaffected charm as a feisty American girl is even more captivating given the contrasting English milieu. And as a former fashion model herself, Lucy dazzles in her stunning outfits and gowns. The cast is top notch and the comic bits keep the plot's tension from getting too dark. William Daniels' cinematography gives the film a lux, noirish gloss. Check out one of the last shots in the film with Sanders sitting at a bar as Ball is seen in a mirror entering the club. Fantastic. For Sirk completists, this is a must-see."
Lured (1947),Underrated crime thriller that reminded me of the Hitchcock pictures from this era,"Lured (1947) is a movie that was Re early available on Tubi. The storyline follows a London serial killer who targets women in personal adds. When a dancer is killed her American friend volunteers to be bait and help capture the killer. This movie is directed by Douglas Sirk (Imitation of Life) and stars Lucille Ball (I Love Lucy), George Sanders (All About Eve), Boris Karloff (The Mummy), Cedric Hardwicke (The Ten Commandments), lan Napier (Marnie) and Joe Calleia (Touch of Evil). This is a very clever movie and reminded me of the Hitchcock pictures from this era. This is essentially a who done it with a creepy stalker, fun characters and a subtle love story sub plot. There's some smart writing to keep moments light. I adored the crossword puzzle tie-ins. The cinematography was also well done with clever camera angles, use of lighting and shadows to create intensity. Lucille Ball was an easy character to root for and it will always be too bad Hollywood didn't allow her to have more leading roles. The conclusion was perfect for the storyline and very rewarding. Overall, this is an underrated crime thriller from the 40s that's a must see for fans of movies from this era. I would score this movie an 8/10 and strongly recommend it."
Lured (1947),The delicate elegance of this world is forever in danger,"By the time Douglas Sirk directed this picture, he'd already established himself as someone who could turn out hits in Hollywood. HITLER'S MADMAN had been a critical and commercial success; and though it did not lead to a contract at MGM, Sirk's services were still in demand. The director would continue to make independent pictures in the mid-1940s for producers who released their efforts through United Artists. Several of these films starred George Sanders on loan from 20th Century Fox. LURED was the third time the actor and director collaborated, and they would team up once more a decade later. LURED marks the first (and only) time Sirk or Sanders ever worked with Lucille Ball. Though she seems an unlikely choice, Ball fits the story quite well. The actress had just been released from her MGM contract and was now freelancing. Here she plays a dancer that helps a Scotland Yard inspector (Charles Coburn) lure a Jack the Ripper-type killer out into the open. She's the bait, so to speak. Ball's character moonlights as a lady detective. Part of the job means answering ads in a personal column that are written to flush out the killer. She soon attracts the attention of a suave gentleman (Sanders). He's a London-based theatrical producer and may be the guy they're after. LURED is a remake of a French film called PIEGES, which was directed by Robert Siodmak in 1939. Maurice Chevalier had the lead role in the earlier version, and Marie Dea played the bait. To facilitate Ball's casting in the Hollywood version, the character is now an American girl who came to London to do a musical show that folded. She stayed and found a job as a taxi dancer. One of her friends is the latest murder victim. So that's what causes her to help police. Sirk switches the setting from Paris to London in order to recreate some of the gothic atmosphere associated with the Ripper case. Moving it to London also allows the director to cast some well-known British character actors in supporting roles. People like Boris Karloff, George Zucco, Cedric Hardwicke and Alan Mowbray. Three of them play crooks. Although Sanders' character calls himself a cad, he's not a crook or a villain. In fact he's quite vulnerable and romantic in his scenes. A love story develops between him and Miss Ball's character, and this pairing assures the audience there will be a happy ending. While the tone remains somewhat comedic, thanks to Ball's snappy line deliveries and Sanders' sarcastic quips, the storyline is somewhat grim. Sirk and his cinematographer, William H. Daniels, make it a point to enshroud the characters in shadows when the suspense is supposed to build. At nearly every turn viewers are reminded that this is a mystery with a killer on the loose. But the killer's true identity is kept a secret until the very end. Any one of the crooks that Sandra deals with could be a murderer, because they all have strange almost psychotic tendencies. Karoff is a mad artist; Hardwicke has a possessive attachment to others; and Mowbray's involved in a smuggling operation where several pretty females have gone missing. While we surmise fairly early that Sanders can't be the killer, it's interesting to see Ball fall in love with him, when she is not yet entirely sure of his innocence. I think part of what makes this film work is the way it's told mostly from the woman's point of view. Coburn's inspector and Zucco's copper are there to assist Ball, but she's the one who takes the risks and becomes embroiled in dangerous situations. The various subplots reveal insights about her. After all she is luring a killer AND Sanders into her trap. A recurring theme in Sirk's films, which becomes more prevalent in his later output at Universal, is entrapment. There's a feeling that Ball is trapping Sanders, even when she seems to reject him; and even when she is still focused on nabbing the man who murdered her best friend. The glamorous costumes she wears, and the elaborately designed sets give us a glimpse of bourgeoisie life. But the delicate elegance of this world is forever in danger of being snuffed out by a madman."
Lured (1947),"""What is it tonight? A sweepstakes for zombies? I hope you two will be very happy.""","Getting home from winning a badge after completing the challenge at Brum Brew Fest in Birmingham, I decided to end my recent run of new viewings of films starring George Sanders. Mentioning to my dad about having recently seen Rebecca and All About Eve,I was happily caught by surprise, when he revealed that he had discovered, that Talking Pictures free online catch-up service, had uploaded a Film Noir with Sanders, which led to me getting ready for a lured expirene. View on the film: Scrolling towards a new date with his devilish cad smile, George Sanders (who worked with Robert Siodmak in 1945 on The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry) gives a wonderfully tasty performance as Flemming, which merrily plays with his traditional sophisticated manner, thanks to Sanders leaning his crisp dialogue delivery towards the ambiguity of being a serial killer, via Sanders having Flemming's loving gazes, linger just a bit too long. Joined by Alan Napier and George Zucco giving wonderfully hard boiled turns as Barrett and Gordon, Boris Karloff gives a fire and brimstone performance as van Druten, whose rants which get everyone in his sights fired up,and the police on edge, due to Karloff's dialogue delivery, making van Druten sound like he is getting struck by lightning. Elbowed by the Hays Code to change the title of the film, in the middle of its theatrical release, the screenplay by Leo Rosten adapts Siodmak's 1939 title Pieges, and ends up at the same place as the title, via the shadow of the Hays Code looming large over the ending, which scrambles to tie everything up neat and tidy. Thankfully, before the final fizzles out, Rosten prints an excellent, page-turner of a Film Noir, where each new personal ad printed in the papers, leave the cops fearing that a serial killer is placing adverts in for his next victim, leading to Inspector Harley Temple (played with dread by Charles Coburn) to believing the only way to stop the killer from expanding his scrapbook, is by offering bait, which Rosten tensely reels out, as Carpenter (cleverly played by Lucille Ball, whose snappy comedic skills, are turned by Ball, to express Carpenter trying in a underhanded way, to gain clues from suspects.) Releasing a searchlight to find the opening credits backed by a splintering score from He (1932-also reviewed) composer Michel Michelet (who also did the Pieges score), directing auteur Douglas Sirk & Queen Christina (1933-also reviewed) cinematographer William H. Daniels take the signature richness of Sirk's ""Women's Picture"" Melodrama works into the shadows, with the laced low-lighting hanging on Sirk's creamy dissolves and stylish tracking shots staying close to Flemming, being all wrapped in Sirk's distinctive, outstanding attention to detail on maximum glamour, which breaks on a glass shattering final, as the killer is left lured."
Lured (1947),Personal Column,"Director Douglas Sirk is not someone associated with a Hitchcock type lighthearted crime drama. Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) is an American stranded in London when the show she was appearing folded early. Now working in dives as a dancer for money. Sandra teams up with Scotland Yard when her friend Lucy disappears. She went off on a date after she saw an ad in the personal columns of a newspaper. Inspector Harley Temple (Charles Coburn) knows there is a serial killer who is luring young ladies from ads in the personal column. He is also taunting the police by sending them poetry influenced by a French poet. Sandra will be the bait. There is also a minder Barrett (George Zucco) who keeps an eye on her. Sandra responds by aiding him with cryptic crossword clues. Wherever she goes, she meets to wealthy cad Robert Fleming (George Sanders) who takes an interest in Sandra. However he also seems to be linked with the missing women. Lured should had been a taut thriller. Sandra meets some oddballs and also untangles a web of criminals sending women to South America. It is a bit too flabby and breezy in the middle, concentrating on romance between Robert and Sanda. There are several effective red herrings, this would had been much better if it was tighter and darker."
Lured (1947),Lured,"Lucille Ball looks really quite glamorous at times in this well cast mystery that is distinctly devoid of, well, actual crime.... She is drafted in by Scotland Yard to assist them in their investigation of eight girls who have gone missing over recent years; the latter being her friend. The one thing these mysteries may have in common is that each girl was written a poem before they went off the radar, and each may have responded to a lonely-hearts type ad in the newspaper. So ""Sandra"" is tasked with responding to each of these ads with a view to ensnaring our would be kidnapper/murderer (George Zucco is great as her police minder throughout this exercise). This is probably the most enjoyable phase of the film, as she encounters a few of life's more curious folks - not least a wonderful, brief, cameo from Boris Karloff - before she alights on the debonaire George Sanders (or does he alight on her?) and his business partner Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The former certainly fits the bill - he makes his romantic intentions clear from the outset, and when certain seemingly conclusive clues start to appear then Charles Coburn (""Insp. Temple"") concludes they have their man...but do they? The story is nothing new here, but the cast work well and though hardly menacing, the drama does build well to a cleverly played out endgame. Ball is very far removed from the characterisations she became much more familiar for, and acquits herself well in good company with her co-stars, a decent script and this is well worth a watch."
Lured (1947),All I could remember was the Boris Karloff scene...,"...but it's just one incident as plucky Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) goes undercover answering dubious ads on the trail of a London serial killer. I'd forgotten how good this film and what a cast! Charles Coburn, George Zucco, Cedric Hardwicke, George Sanders... Sandra is being stalked - it helps that's there's a superficial resemblance between her minder, Barrett and the real criminal. If you like this, and appreciate Lucy's skills as an actress, you'll like Dark Corner where she plays a feisty secretary to Mark Steel in a plot that involves William Bendix and Clifton Webb. And the script is by Leo Rosten who also scripted this mystery! George Sanders and Cedric Hardwicke live in an impossibly grand mansion with many oak staircases and a faithful housekeeper who is more than just a cypher. They run some grand nightclubs so we can share in the high life. Even the background artistes are excellent - the woman at the bar, the woman next to Lucy at the concert. However I thought Miss Ball's gowns were all frightful. Fleming may have bought her trousseau, and Scotland Yard gave her a clothes allowance, but how did she afford that ermine?"
In a Lonely Place (1950),Brilliant,"The subject of this movie is the art of creative writing and the title tells us where writers work. The art form that it mostly closely resembles is acting, but writers have no directors to shout, ""Cut. Print."" So the schizophrenic madness is ongoing. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, ""A writer is a thousand different people, all struggling to be one person."" Writers, like hermits, live alone, talking to themselves. They are always at work. Henry Miller: ""Most writing is done away from the desk."" Writing is autobiographical. It is a quest for self-discovery. Anger fuels self-exile and earns the repudiation of others. In Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart), Dorothy B. Hughes contrived the perfect vehicle for the writer's self-realization. He is locked into himself, trapped. Aristotle: ""We are what we repeatedly do."" Real writers, good writers may entertain us, enlighten us, but, as Dixon Steele learns, they cannot live with us, no matter the intensity of their desire. The gulf between the imaginary and the real is too vast."
In a Lonely Place (1950),Another Bogart Classic!,"Enjoyed this one a lot. Humphrey Bogart plays a screen writer named Dixon Steele (Dix Steele to his friends and how cool is that?). He's suspected of murder which seems absurd at first but the more we see his violent temper the more we (and his new girlfriend Laurel Grey, played by the radiant Gloria Grahame) start to suspect him. The plot unfolds from there, with Bogart brilliantly playing an almost Jekyll and Hyde type character, going from mild mannered writer to flying off the handle in a moment's notice. I highly recommend this one, although my bias for Bogart films might be showing through."
In a Lonely Place (1950),It's actually fun to watch.,"I've seen this movie twice. The funniest parts are Bogey's demeanor throughout the movie. First of all he weighs about 140 pounds, but he supposedly goes around starting fist fights. He even says he's done it 100 times. Then he invites a coat check girl to his apartment at 10 or 11 at night so she can tell him about a book and she actually goes. Plus the girl breaks a date with her boyfriend so she can do this. But when the girl is found dead and Bogey is named the suspect, he literally doesn't care. He's just lackadaisical in the interrogation room. Then he hooks up with his beautiful neighbor, has her move in, and orders her around like a tyrant. I loved the scene where Bogart is at his typewriter and orders his girlfriend to make him, ""Orange Juice, eggs over easy, bacon, toasted muffins, strawberry jam, and lots of coffee"" Then she happily says, you'll have it in 10 minutes. Hilarious scene."
In a Lonely Place (1950),7.9/10. Recommended,"For a couple of months now, i am watching a lot of old movies and i'm very glad for that: I hadn't realised all these years what i was missing, there are so many great movies produced in this era. There are so many things to comment about. For example, Humphrey Bogart. I knew Bogart was charismatic, his presence is undeniably magnetic. I didn't know though he is also a great actor. I was under the impression he plays the same character over and over (typecasting). I was wrong. He is a versatile actor. And he proves his versatility in this movie. It's not the first time he is menacing. But it's the first time he is enigmatic. And so mysterious. This is a great movie that keeps you guessing until the ending. It's not a typical crime drama/film noir, it's more like a psychological drama/thriller. Watch it without reading too much about the plot, you will enjoy it more like this . I really loved the ending, way more complex -in a good way- than i expected."
In a Lonely Place (1950),Misconceptions and They Damn Mean Nothing,"Based on a novel of the same name, ""In a Lonely Place"" is slice of life noir at one of its best. Dixon ""Dix"" Steele is a washed-up screenwriter in Hollywood looking for a break. With a rap sheet as long as his fuse is short the man isn't someone you'd want to call your friend. In one unfortunate night he invites a cute and sexy hat girl over his place to read a novel he's basing his script on. Fate unfolds and events turn out to be as predictable as they are surprising. A sullen and heavy-lidded love interest, sycophantic well meaning friends, suspicious cops and him being his own worst enemy Steele's world is as dark as it is frustrating. With good direction and able performances especially by lead stars Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame the film moves at a gripping pace the suspense nary taking a break. While the conventions of the time limit the film's full potential this is one of the stellar B & W vintages to modernly hold up well. Dark, unsettling and riveting. Essential."
In a Lonely Place (1950),"Gripping portrayal of an angry, violent individual","Produced in the years following World War II, this powerful movie reflects the nation's effort to make people ""well-adjusted"" and to withdraw as quickly as possible from years of violence. But this is not a message movie nor a sociological docudrama. It is the portrait of a human being in pain. The relentless pace and great acting (Bogart and Grahame) draw us into the story of a man whose anger is overwhelming and increasingly out of control. Watch for the stunning scene in which Bogart shakes up a dinner party with friends by performing the strangling of a murder victim--his eyes glittering as he tightens his arm around the neck of his friend's wife. But director Nicholas Ray is too compassionate to turn his protagonist into a stereotype or a monster, and we are made to feel the loneliness and desolation that come with rage. (Added bonus: Watch for Hadda Brooks as the singer in the nightclub.) A great movie, as fresh, original, and wrenching today as in mid-century."
In a Lonely Place (1950),The Far From Mighty Scribe...,"The fickle world of writing scripts has set the beat, left you lonely, isolated, in retreat, cynical and quite sneering, motivation is despairing, a murdered hat-check girl brings police and some heat. Laurel Gray provides an alibi, defence, an affair that takes a day to start, commence, passions burn and fires rage, as you draft from page to page, past history suggests, you are quite tense. As time moves on, your anger oversteps the mark, your whole demeanour's built on fury and is dark, as you erupt and overflow, people aren't safe, punches get thrown, you're bite's at lot more worse, after you've barked. Great performances, a dark and disturbing tale, as relevant today as it was back then, which can't always be said for films of the time."
In a Lonely Place (1950),Crazy eyes Bogie,"A screenwriter is accused of murdering a woman who left his apartment late. While drinking and slumming around, he falls in love with his neighbour, a real foxy dame, and sparks fly. They're all set to marry when she starts to think he may be a killer and wants to run away. This movie features Bogart flying off the handle and seeming pretty insane, but also Gloria Graham being incredibly alluring until she gets cold feet. A solid performance even if it's never quite clear why she would fall for him so fast. The ending works, even if it's a little too convenient. Overall a good, different Bogart performance worth seeing."
In a Lonely Place (1950),"Ooooh.....temper, temper!","Barely have the credits rolled, before belligerent Bogie is berating a fellow motorist. Having underwhelmed a pair of young autograph hunters, he resumes the mayhem by manhandling a motor mouth inside 'Paul's Nightclub.' There's an upswing in the evening's fortunes, however, with an invitation for hat check girl, Martha Stewart to join him at his apartment, in order to hear her analysis of a trashy novel. A most unconventional date, explained by the fact that Bogie is a talented, but temperamental and tempestuous screenwriter in dire need of a HIT. Unfortunately, he appears to be in a similar state of mind to Neil Young, when he wrote 'Borrowed Tune' and is only too relieved to give Stewart $20 taxi fare, sparing him the ear bashing torture of the novel's many sub-plots. A fate preferable, however, to winding up at police headquarters in the early hours, on suspicion of Stewart's brutal murder. Bogie's petulant indifference and track record of assaults only adds to the bad vibes until an olive branch is thrown by detective buddy, Frank Lovejoy, aware of the suspect's idiosyncratic nature, but convinced of his innocence. Beautiful, dutiful neighbour, Gloria Grahame, provides an alibi and soon romance blossoms. Humph, a happily changed man toils to turn the wretched book into a workable screenplay and all appears well, until.....a convivial dinner leaves all present with a nasty aftertaste, following his macabre, graphic theory behind Stewart's murder. Shortly afterwards, he goes into over reaction overdrive. The mildest provocation, a mere speck of a misunderstanding inducing an episode of crazy, reckless driving and a violent outburst of such shuddering proportions that Grahame is left feeling both shocked and threatened, ruefully reflecting on the wisdom of picking Bogie for a lover. Don't look here for pulsating, rip-roaring, breathless, wall to wall action, or frenzied, bite yer fingernails down to the elbows suspense. Nicholas Ray's seminal noir is a brooding, simmering slow burner, punctuated by sporadic volcanic eruptions, made all the more impactful by their relative infrequency. Hollywood gazing into its own mirror produces a reflection as toxic as it is tawdry."
In a Lonely Place (1950),He Did Not Die When She Left Him-----Or Did He?,"Humphrey Bogart gave us his great ""Psychopath Trilogy"" in the short space of only six years: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950) and The Caine Mutiny (1954). The first (and probably the best known and most admired of the three films) involved Bogart's memorable creation Fred C. Dobbs. He was a decidedly paranoid and disturbed man with clearly defined anti-social tendencies, who also often talked to himself when agitated. The third (which presented perhaps the most pathetic and sympathetic of the three leading man roles) introduced us to the famous Captain Queeg----a middle aged veteran naval officer who had been in one too many battles, and as a result slowly became unhinged in the performance of his normal duties to the point that a sober but foolish subordinate officer instigated the title mutiny. But the second (and least known film in the trilogy) challenged Bogart to perform probably the most complex and difficult character of the three movies as screenwriter Dix Steele-----a man of considerable warmth, taste and sensitivity who was also saddled with a.dangerous and violent nature that could suddenly erupt into actions that were highly reckless and sometimes quite destructive in their consequences. In a Lonely Place (IALP) featured a mature and almost charismatic individual, who under the right set of circumstances could project significant charm and likability. But if Steele were ever confronted by an unexpected issue that upset him and stressed him out------his nature could undergo a traumatic and often menacing change for the worse. IALP's story spins a tale about how such a character reacted to personal problems that arose when he fell in love with a budding actress named Laurel Gray (played winningly by Gloria Grahame). As Bogart's psychopathic writer gets deeper into his relationship with Laurel and finds himself becoming dominated by conflicted feelings involving a lack of trust that leads to furious rage-----he descends into an unpleasant world of violence. In IALP, Bogart revealed his great art as an actor by making it completely believable for Steele to go from a pleasant fellow to an off-putting monster without loosing a beat. It is a spectacular performance-----one of his very best. Lauren Bacall was originally sought to play Laurel-----but Warner Brothers would not agree to the loan out arrangement. This fortuitous circumstance allowed the often underestimated Grahame to play perhaps the finest part of her career------certainly much better than her Oscar awarded role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952). IALP is one of Nicholas Ray's most celebrated films, and he also contributed (uncredited) to the engrossing screenplay by Andrew Solt. IALP has a strong supporting cast featuring Frank Lovejoy, Jeff Donnell, Art Smith and Carl Benton Reid. Only Robert Warwick as the alcoholic elderly Shakespearian actor is a distraction with his somewhat over the top performance. The cinematography of Burnett Guffey should be singled out for special praise with its moody black and white presentation. IALP is a film that Bogart wanted to make, and he gives us in Dix Steele a character that probably comes the closest to reflecting his real life persona. Perhaps this may explain why Bogart did not particularly like the movie. In any event, IALP is a major artistic and critical success that has continued to gain in stature since its initial release. How much of Dix Steele ultimately crept into Bogart's later conception of Captain Queeg is a question best left to the consideration of his many appreciative fans."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Instructive about 2 eras of history,"This movie is an example of why quotas in actor hiring are ludicrous. The story to be realistic requires this group of actors. No one should ever tell an artist or entertainer that their art or entertainment should include a quota. Then it is no longer art or entertainment it is the opposite. Unfortunately, awards now often hinge on meeting quotas and a deserving work like this can not win. Again pointing out how ludicrous quotas are in this context. Many projects cannot even be made or funded now because they do not meet quotas. At the time that this film potrays this kind of thinking was very prevalent it is ironic now the film itself will suffer from this kind of mentality. Art and entertainment cannot be pre-programmed by ideology. Historical art and entertainment must be true to actual history. Otherwise it is doing a disservice to the story it is telling. Applying this standard to production and recognition as well only does a further disservice."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Masterwork,"This film is Masterwork one of the greatest films of the last few years. However, since it does not have... it can not win any awards. This is the case because awards now mandate... be enforced on all films. I am surprised it got funding to be made considering that it... A lot of excellent scripts go unfunded and are not made because they are not... enough. Too bad if you come up with an idea for a Masterwork but if you do not have enough... it will never be made. In this day and age even certain topics are forbidden but they are important to learn from the evil of the past so you do not repeat it when fighting that evil today. Ironic isn't it?"
The Zone of Interest (2023),Too Subtle for People Who Need to Understand this Film,"I respect Jonathan Glazer's idea for this movie and the themes of the banality of evil, but I feel there is a problem with the final product. People who need to see this movie, especially in today's climate, either won't, or if they do, they may not pick up on anything. Yes, it's obvious it takes place outside of Auschwitz, but anything more than that is very subtle. I don't think it would have hurt to actually make the Nazis seem bad at least once just to hammer the point home. There are a couple of powerful scenes such as when you can hear the guards find a prisoner who stole an apple, but those scenes are rare. The different filming choices were interesting, but I found that they took away from the movie rather than add. It seems like I'm in the minority for how I feel about this movie and that's ok. I think the ideas this movie presents are strong, but only for people that might already understand those ideas and that's the problem. There are other Holocaust movies that show the true horrors much better and I think that's more important at the end of the day."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Read the book or wait to stream it at home for free!,"Out of 8 people in the theatre this afternoon, 6 of us hung around in the lobby to talk about the film. We all felt the same way .... sooo boring!! After 25 minutes of commercials and we finally get the Feature Presentation sign then we get over 3 minutes of a black screen. We thought it more like 5 but usher said it was 3. Film finally starts with banal chat by the banks of a river with family fishing, swimming and beach type activities. Appr 10 minutes of what some would say notihng. BUT .. the son was picking up something on the beach which turned out to be teeth he had found to add to his growing collection. My feeling is I would probably gotten a lot more from the book that this movie. . Waste of a nice afternoon but figured correctly there would not be many in the theatre. Last few minutes is of the Museum there and displays of shoes and cloting but again .... why did we have to see cleaners washing the floors and the windows while showing this??"
The Zone of Interest (2023),"Life near Auschwitz, told in hushed tones","This incandescent film portrays the idyllic life that the family of Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss enjoyed in a sumptuous house right next to the concentration camp in Auschwitz right in the middle of the Holocaust. There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout. We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination. A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire. But overall, this is an extraordinary and memorable film from start to finish. Recommended to everyone, without exception."
The Zone of Interest (2023),One of the most boring movies I've ever seen,"Yes it's very very boring, nothing happens the first 45 minutes. Just mundane everyday things in the life of Nazi Germans. The only tension came when we thought they might have to move. This movie is living proof that tension is what makes a strong story and keeps audiences engaged. I actually fell asleep for the last 2/4 of the movie. I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas? I should research this more, but the buildings were all so much prettier than I've seen in historical photos."
The Zone of Interest (2023),The Zone of Interest,"Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Hot garbage,"Just when you thought A24 couldn't come out with more totally derivative garbage... they go and outdo themselves! Stylistically, the movie is extremely forceful. If you think ""The Zone of Interest"" is ""subtle"", in any way, you might as well not notice repeatedly getting hit over the head with a hammer. Considering the catalogue of movies that A24 has come out with in recent years this just makes the nth addition in a long line of identical movies... which really makes me wonder what they are paying the directors for exactly? This is Marvel for people that think they are above Marvel but fall for the same exact formulaic garbage."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Much less subtle than it thinks,"This is an exceptionally disappointing film, misleading historically and dramatically empty, with a boring screenplay. It wants to make a point about the proximity of Rudolf Hoss's house to the suffering victims of Nazism, but it gives no proper impression of the geography of the Auschwitz complex. Thus we see the tops of the well built Austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I, but nothing at all of Birkenau, a mile away, where the worst horrors unfolded. It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all. For the rest, the scenes are nicely shot but lacking in cinematic or dramatic interest."
The Zone of Interest (2023),Misleading and dull,"Presumably those who made this thought they were being subtle but all they have done is produce more holocaust porn. First, they get the geography of the Auschwitiz complex all wrong. Yes Hoss's house was very close to Auschwitz I but the real horrors in 1943 were happening at Birkenau a mile away. In any case showing the top half of the very well built austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I all the time makes it seem like aregular prison. The train sounds in the backrgound are not those of a train slowing down. Hoss is presented at the end as a man with a conscience, throwing up at the prosoect of killing 700,000 hungarians. He had no conscience at all. At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs. Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong."
Babylon (I) (2022),This is rollercoaster Cinema,"The movie will leave a lasting impression, despite its sometimes longer cuts and marauding plot. This is not a feel-good theatrical production, but it's very much a cynical celebration of cinema and it's dreamers, with all the theatrical flair you can imagine. Crazy unexpected moments in the movie, ranging from extreme ostentatious and depravity to extreme vulgarity and sentimentality. It subtly turns a lense on the industry, and exposes how it has dehumanised and objectified people by exploiting every person's vulnerabilities, and how that in turn changes the people, and that in turn changes cinema, which in turn changes people again. And what is particularly good, is that the audience is also brought into the telling as well The cycle of emotions is felt throughout the film. The promise of the American Dream never fails to deliver on that emotional rollercoaster, even if the dream results in failure. My thinking is that many bad reviews may have been subconsciously annoyed that it essentially points a finger at every person."
Babylon (I) (2022),Outstanding on multiple levels,"Babylon offered pure escapism and mixes of comedy and tragedy to keep movie-lovers transfixed. What a pity people did not value this wonderful movie. Music, costumes, make-up, script, acting, cinemaphotography. Choreography, sets, acting and editing were remarkable for revealing the enticement and revulsion of those involved in the movie industry. Brad Pitt is such an under-rated actor, who really gets the industry. Such a love-hate relationship, seduction and bemusement, opulence and decadence, torture and triumph, enticement and revulsion co-exist in the world of movie-making. See the movie and enjoy the craft and expertise exerted during its production by so many people. This movie paid homage to Hollywood and films despite exposing the.exploitation, destruction and collateral damage caused by the business. A Harvey Weinstein look alike even enters to show who really runs this money-making fiasco. Gross yet gorgeous sums up the industry. Just watch and enjoy on multiple levels. This movie appeals to so many people for different reasons. Watch and enjoy."
Babylon (I) (2022),Unforgivably Bad,"I do not know whose terrible idea this was, but this film is so historically inaccurate and generally anachronistic that I hated it within just a few minutes. It's as though some idiot imagined that the 1920s were some bizarre mix of the 1950s and 1970s except with slightly different clothes, and I can tell you point blank that even the wildest people didn't use the F word that much in 1926. 100 years ago people had their own slang and go-to curse words, saying the F word really wasn't a thing until later in the 20th century. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Margot Robbie doesn't look ANYTHING like a silent film actress, she was cast by 21st century American ideas of beauty, and even worse than that...she dresses for the first 20 minutes of the film like she ran away from a heavy metal themed prom in 1987. This movie is stupid and obvious while perhaps giving teenagers a false impression of what the 1920s might have been like. Ugh. Nightmarish."
Babylon (I) (2022),"Funny, crazy and loving","If I know in advance that a movie is going to last 3 hours, I'm extremely skeptical that I'll be able to sit through it. It's out of the question for me to split it up, so I watch it in one go and take my time. With Babylon, I waited a while and then treated myself to it, with the result that I wasn't bored for a minute. Damien Chazelle surprised me, because I was expecting an acid trip à la Baz Luhrmann. But that wasn't the case. The scene with the elephant was a successful introduction to the film's drastic humor, which at the same time takes the absurdity of early Hollywood to the extreme, reaching its first climax in the battle scenes of the monumental film shot later. And it doesn't really end there. I can't agree with some of the things that have been written here about the sexual permissiveness, but maybe that's because I'm European and I'm more upset by violence. It's there too, but in sparing doses. I see the movie much more as a loving homage to a crazy industry that holds nothing sacred and sometimes sacrifices people for the sake of success. Margot Robbie at the center of it all is fantastic, the rest of the cast does a good job too, and the score is an absolute feast for the ears. A bit too long, all that? Yes, half an hour less wouldn't have hurt, but ultimately only the maudlin ending was completely superfluous."
Babylon (I) (2022),Maybe a little too real...and long.,"I've read a lot about Hollywood Bablyon and how primitive and how debauched the Silent Film Era was. Before Talkies, a lot of talent wasn't really necessary, just looking good in black & white film was. The more exaggerated acting movements the better due to the lack of sound with card signs the only accompaniment Moving pictures in the beginning drew a lot from previous entertainment genres some legitimate, and a wide variety of people, traveling stage actors, burlesque, vaudeville, circuses and carnivals, all headed to CA to be a star. The movie illustrates that wild mixture
very well in a Caligula-type opening scene. After defining the players lack of boundaries about most everything, It also shows the long hours, & not terrific conditions, with small sets and few cameras grinding out different movie shorts, like a large carnival out in the desert heat. The stress and the deadlines, the drinking and drugs and orgies took their tolls, sometimes fatally. Brad Pitt is a Clark Gable-type handsome leading man who is famous in the Silent Era, but has a tough transition as the Talkies begin and he starts to age as well. Margot Robbie, while playing I'm sure what she is supposed to, is so raunchy and gross it was surprising. She was playing a star who degraded herself for fame, but to me it got so bad, it was insulting to her. I kind of felt like Diego Calva taking it all in from his inception delivering an elephant to the orgy, his love for Nellie (Robbie) who was so damaged from life, that even though he was repulsed by her behavior at times, he loved her. His departure from that life and his return years later, taking in a talkie, and looking devastated at what was as he watched A musical, recalling the past. Too many bodily fluids and a world away from Barbie."
Babylon (I) (2022),That was a really good movie!,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I had high expectations about it, mainly because of the cast. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I really enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and innovative, because there aren't any other movies similar to this one. Gladly, the storyline was very well written and well-explained. Also, the characters were very interesting and well-developed. The casting of the movie was amazing and their acting was excellent (Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt nailed it). Moreover, the 1920's were very well portrayed, especially the outfits and the music. I have to admit, it was an expectedly very intense movie, full of nudity, blood and drugs. The opening scene was 30 minutes long, very chaotic, well edited and really promising. The 2nd act was very emotionally intense, kinda funny sometimes and definitely enjoyable. The ending scene was definitely unpredictable, kinda sad and it's cinematography was brilliant. Overall, ""Babylon"" was a really good film, full of shocking scenes, sex and gore. Last but not least, I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
Babylon (I) (2022),Perfect,"I can say it was the best movie I've watched recently. The cast, the storytelling, and so on were perfect. Despite being three hours long, I wasn't bored for a minute, and I was even a bit sad when it ended. It seems like the budget might have been a bit limited, $90 million isn't much, but it doesn't change the fact that the film is excellent. The ending wasn't as I expected, which was a bit disappointing, but the impact of the movie still lingers. I highly recommend watching it. You won't regret it, for sure. Seeing quality actors like Brad Pitt in a film was a happiness after a long time. Definitely give it a try; it deserves a chance."
Babylon (I) (2022),Yawn,"""Babylon"" wants to big, bad, and bold, but it only ever really achieves bad. Now, I have 512 characters to fill here, so I'll do what Damien Chazelle did: boobsdrugsboobsorgycelebritycameocelebrityslummingboobsdrugsdepressiondepressiondepressionboobs.

This is drudgery, really. The horse is dead 20minutes in and there's two hours and fifty minutes to go, all to arrive at an offensively glib happy ending. Truly awful in a way only Damien Chazelle can achieve."
Babylon (I) (2022),Was waiting for the entertaining ending...,"I feel like all the positives I have seen about this film surround mainly the acting from the star-studded cast and the cinematography which is all very worthy. However in hindsight I wouldn't have spent 3 hours watching a film for those positives alone. I am not one to be put off by longer films as I think many of them are brilliant and a good long film doesn't feel long, while this one did. The film starts off rather fast paced through the intro and the music/sound and tempo is a consistency within this film however the story between all the upbeat sounds is a slow one. I feel like the story has a deeper meaning to how the film industry changed very quickly through the 1900s and some may appreciate this film more than others. Sadly, too slow of a film for me, and I was left hoping for a brilliant ending after a slow 2 hours in the middle of the film."
Babylon (I) (2022),Spectacular to watch,"The idea of watxhing how Hollywood was evolving, how they used to party, and climbed the ladder of movie stars' success, to finally for some to fall, was very intriguing. So first view was in the movie theater. Then I thought ""The film is so great, you must own it!"". That is how I became the owner of limited deition Bluray disc Robbie Margot is at her best, really authentic in her performance. The same with Brad Pitt, who tunes to playing an utterly different character. The film is quite sophisticated and multi-levelled; but very enjoyable. Would I call it a comedy? Even though it is a drama, both of which fall under the same literature category (drama), there are many laughable moments, which come to be seen in just the right moment. Finally, there is a music and the two pieces by Justin Hurvitz, which adds to the whole atmosphere of the movie."

Society of the Snow (2023),Incredible resilience of a story well told,"A short review as the emotion is still raw from watching this incredible story of spirit and sheer will. This story is well known, however this film inserts you in this horror and makes you question your own strength of mind and body, there really are no words to describe this situation, only raw unadulterated emotion and respect for these outstanding individuals that formed a relentless group of survivors, my feelings come with shame as personally this will is not in my remit, there were tears surging emotions and awe. This is acted with a heartfelt respect of epic quality, the direction and scenes flow beautifully. It pulls no punches and certainly is no fairy tale, the unity found by these outstanding examples of shared will is extremely humbling."
Society of the Snow (2023),An incredibly power story and gut wrenching at the same time,"An incredibly moving at the same time gut wrenching story about our survival instinct depicted in a remarkably powerful manner. In 1999 my school teacher had told me this story. This story has stayed with me since then and once I watched this movie I realised that she was fairly accurate in her narration It is a movie which is a testament of human spirit is all that I want to say about the plot even though it would be a mistake to call such a story as a plot. All the actors have done a top notch job. The camera work and direction is excellent. You really get involved in their effort to survive and so badly want them to survive. This movie connects at a human level irrespective of your culture. This movie provokes your moral compass too. To what extent you will go to survive,?does survival mean anything.?Who truly survived.? There are so many questions that you feel will forever remain unanswered. At the end though your are relieved. You can't miss this movie even if you are not an adventure buff. It is worth every breath."
Society of the Snow (2023),Spanish Disaster Movie by Juan Antonio BAYONA,"Since the tsunami shocker THE IMPOSSIBLE with Naomi WATTS and Tom HOLLAND, it has been known that the Spanish director Juan Antonio BAYONA has a very good hand for disaster films. He stages the respective catastrophes in a powerful and visually overwhelming way, approaching those affected by an unexpected event with great tact and sensitivity. Based on the novel LA SOCIEDAD DE LA NIEVE by Pablo VIERCI, BAYONA tells the well-known story of a rugby team from Montevideo in Uruguay that crashes in the Andes on a flight to Chile. What follows is a long ordeal lasting several months, which the few survivors only survive because they cross one last taboo... This addresses the questions that none of us want to imagine: What would we do to stay alive in a hopeless situation? The author Pablo VIERCI probably went to school in Montevideo with some of those affected, but was not himself on Flight 571 in October 1972. Nevertheless, the plot seems very believable and also includes the perspective of those who didn't make it. BAYONA has created a very excellent film that uses beautiful images to tell of the horror of the deepest abyss that people can fall into. The technically outstanding film was awarded two EUROPEAN FILM AWARDS for visual effects and make-up. It also received a GOLDEN GLOBE nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. Completely right! With films like THE PLATFORM, BELOW ZERO and most recently NOWHERE, the global streaming service NETFLIX has proven that it has an excellent hand for Spanish-language cinema. THE SOCIETY OF THE SNOW will most certainly continue this success story."
Society of the Snow (2023),The final 30 minutes completes the 1993 version,"I've always loved the 1993 version (Alive) and seen it lots of times so I was always looking forward to seeing this. I thought it was pretty good... that is until the last 30 minutes - wow! So much emotion and completes the whole story that was missing from the 1993 version. By no means am I saying this is a poor film, in fact the production was great and so much time and effort went into this going from the write ups prior to its release. Having relations involved from the initial crash also makes it more emotional. If you find it long at almost 2hrs 30min just hold out to the last 30 minutes."
Society of the Snow (2023),A Message of Hope in a Time of Crisis,"I am 61 years old and I remember well the events told in ""La sociedad de la nieve"". The film does not hide or underestimate what 50 years ago shocked the whole world, but - as the title suggests - it frames it in a broader context: what eventually humanity is. We are not the strongest race, nor the fastest, nor - for some time now - the most intelligent on our planet. But, as a group, we are incredibly resilient. Man is weak, but humanity is impossible to defeat. A message of great hope at a time when we are facing terrible challenges ahead of us. Not to be missed. Amazing soundtrack by Michail Giacchino. After having watch the music, listen to ""Found"" which beautifully captures the message of the whole movie with minimal use of instruments and notes."
Society of the Snow (2023),One of the best movies I've seen,"Hear me out, I'm a cinephile and I can say this movie is really something else. Netflix invested a lot of money in this movie but it's definitely s movie you want to see in the theaters. Don't watch it if you're looking for some lighthearted entertainment. Based in a real story and it's a lot to take in, specially if you know the story behind this movie or if you've watched the past movie about this tragedy (or miracle): Alive. Pedro Luque, in charge of photography, really shines in this one. It has some surprising cameos with actual survivors. All my respect to the team that made this master piece."
Society of the Snow (2023),Goes under the skin,"If you get the chance, I'd recommend watching this film in a movie theater. It is an intense and beautifully shot movie about the Uruguayan flight that crashed in the Andes in 1972. Due to the actors' great performance and the very good production value, you seem to feel the despair that the survivors must have felt and sometimes even the cold they must have felt. You get to understand how hard and horrendous the decision must have been to eat the deceased in order to get a chance to survive. The cinematography is great and the beautiful shots of the Andes contrast sharply with the forlorn situation the survivors find themselves in. The flight crash was very well executed and seemed quite realistic. This movie might be uncomfortable to watch and some people might feel at unease with the some of the depicted events, but other than that I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the specific event and/or human resilience when faced with adverse circumstance and low odds of survival."
Society of the Snow (2023),The title says it all,"First, let's get something out of the way: ""Society of the Snow"" is not a remake of ""Alive"" (1993), just like James Cameron's ""Titanic"" wasn't a remake of 1958's ""A Night to Remember"", which also wasn't a remake of any previous Titanic-centered movies. This is the adaptation of a different book covering the story of the Andes survivors - another take on the same real-life event. As directed by J. A. Bayona (back at the survival thriller genre after 2012's ""The Impossible"") and led by a group of unknown Uruguayan and Argentinean actors, ""Society of the Snow"" is not only authentically cast and produced, but powerfully moving in its conception of narrative. There's an unexpected focal character here, but the movie plays out as an ensemble piece and, true to its title, portrays every person as essential to the outcome. There's a feeling that those who lost their lives were just as responsible for the ultimate rescue of their remaining friends as those who eventually reached civilization to seek help - not just for selflessly volunteering their bodies for food, but for providing comfort, solidarity, acceptance, even humor!, under the most dreadful of circumstances. This is a movie that will stay with you. Please, don't miss out on it."
Society of the Snow (2023),The human spirit in full flight,"Already having seen Alive several times and being
v familiar with the 1972 story, I honestly didn't believe it necessary to see this version. However a good friend persuaded me to go see it and the rest is history! This is without doubt the definitive version, the story is told with authenticity and a v keen Director's eye. I was worried about the foreign subtitles, but needn't have been since it kept me in the movie and made the connection to all the players even more heartfelt. This is a reminder to us all, that nothing is impossible and when facing insurmountable adversity the human spirit is capable of triumph! Inspirational and to those who died on that fateful and subsequent days in the Andes, they will never be forgotten 🙏🏿"
The Northman (2022),SAXO revisited,"Being danish and in process of re-reading SAXOs Gesta Danorum - The Chronicles of the Danes - I am very pleased with the imagery and characters of this film. The Northman doesn't boast of the foundation in the year 1200 story of the danes, but
even if the manuscript is a cut & paste rendering of the chronicles mixed with the icelandic sagaes and baltic druidism it still rings true. The best thing is that Amleth gets a glorious death. Saxos Amleth just fizzles out and Shakespeares Hamlet is reduced to a disgruntled teen-ager. The norwegian Louis Mode made a series of illustrations for the 1898 danish version - they get new life after having seen this film."
The Northman (2022),Very disturbing,"Scenes of children being killed and being ripped away from their mothers to be killed are extremely distressing. I'm aware this is a Viking movie and violence is expected, but this crossed a line for me. I got through Vikings and The Last Kingdom, loved them both, and while there was violence in those series there was not violence toward children. Up until that point it was ok, acting was great, but I couldn't get past that and had to turn it off. I know this is one person's opinion and what I find upsetting isn't the same as others, but it's important to point out for others who might be triggered by these scenes."
The Northman (2022),"Wow, just wow","As others have said, if you're looking for big battles and loads of blood and guts fighting then this is not the movie for you. To me this ran along at the pace of my two other favourite movies ""Valhalla Rising"" and ""Aguerre Wrath of God"". The look of the film is what sold it to me first. After being disappointed with other Viking series and movies it was a refreshing change to see one portraying fairly accurately the clothing, the weapons and some of the rituals for the Viking times. I was impressed with Alexander Skarsgards understated performance as Amleth the usurped prince and with his adversary Fjolner. The acting by everyone was excellent and allowed the story to be told without the usual 20th century histrrics that are the usual markers. I really enjoyed it and if you view with the right relaxed attitude you'll get it. Added to my favourites list."
The Northman (2022),Almost fell asleep,"This is one of the most boring film I have seen this year. Oh yes plenty of blood and guts, but absolutely no character development. The character are boring and sometimes really bad acting. The dialects are all over the place. You hear dialects from America, England and North Scandinavia. Apparently the actors didn't have time to learn at least a some kind of Scandinavia dialect. Even Claes Bang (whom is Danish) had a American dialect. And after 2 hours they finally get to final showdown. By that time you couldn't care less, your so bored that your ready to turn that damn thing of. But your hoping that the ending will make up for the rest of this horrible movie. But noooo, the ending is the standard ending. Page 1 in Director handbook: ""if your audience seems bored, give them this ending."""
The Northman (2022),Wait... I've seen it! Glad I've forgotten it already!,"A movie so bad I'd forgotten I'd seen it. To describe this movie in one sentence: From what I remember, I'll have to say it's quite a forgettable one, cuz not much worth remembering. Anyways! Ever since seeing the movie on Prime, I've been thinking about watching it, but something kept me away from ever watching it... HOWEVER every now and then I'd see the movie while scrolling through Prime and I'd go... ""Maybe"", but still... a higher power or something was keeping me away from it even though this is my kind of movie. I finally decided to watch it yesterday... so I opened it up and left it open in a tab, until a few minutes ago, today, when I decided to ""FINALLY"" watch it once and for all! As soon as I started the movie I started thinking about having seen this cast in a movie before, and luckily, barely a minute in I remembered slightly that this might be that horrible movie that I'd once upon a time seen, barely Two years ago... So I decided to check IMDB ratings, I usually rate and put them in my watched list... and yeah, that refreshed my memory and saved me TWO hours. It shouldn't be this hard to remember a movie, and yet, somehow for some reason every time I saw this title my mind repressed the fact I'd seen it, and subconsciously held me away from it, until my stubborn self finally decided to give it a looksie..."
The Northman (2022),The great strength of the film of Robert Eggers is the way it sews historical and symbolic elements to give a very particular weight to its plot,"Robert Eggers' most ambitious project so far, and his first with a large Hollywood studio, ""The Northman"" is a classic story of revenge. King Crow, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), Amleth's father (Oscar Novak), was killed by his b*stard brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). He also took the boy's mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) as his wife and killed the joke, Heimir (Willem Dafoe), a family friend. Years pass. Amleth, now adult, should go in search of revenge. A witch (Bjork) shows the way. He will go to the north, find a sword, and make a difficult choice between his personal vended and the safety of his beloved. Even to support this detailed, Mise en scene preserves a very welcome theatrical aspect, backed by pauses between the choreography of the action scenes, leaving the bloodshed more visceral; in the conduct of a ""stage"" of interpretations, where the entire cast (which is excellent, despite the loaded accent) follows the far -fetched frequency of the text; and in the organized division into chapters, valuing the dynamism of assembly and its gentle transitions between temporalities and geographies. Highlight for the production design in lease, making that universe more believable and also for sound mixing, causing the ambient sounds to penetrate our ears as if we were in it, manipulating the purposely cracked - but excellent for this factor - soundtrack exactly at the moments that If you are asking for tension or doubt (for dream sequences), reinforcing this almost face -to -face immersion character from the theater. ""The Northman"" brings such an interesting outfit to this already known structure that there is no other way to describe the feature film that is not masterful. It is cinema in its gross state, to delight for images and bring the fantastic to the worldly. This is because he is, at the same time, a faithful historical portrait of the Scandinavian peoples in the late 9th century and a portrait of their customs, presenting all their rites and beliefs. And what makes it so unique and powerful is how he can take advantage of this almost anthropological fidelity to explore the entire symbolic burden linked to each of these elements, taking advantage of this strength to make his history grow. What makes this movie so unique is how it sews these three spheres to recreate an entire culture - and this is very rare to see in the cinema. In just over two hours, he ties real and fantastic not just to impress and play with what is true or not. Also, because it doesn't matter. What is really important here is the symbolic burden of the gods, rituals, beliefs and customs, and how it all guides the life of a people. This is where the feature is so close to the myth of Campbell, but the concept of myth itself: this narrative that carries a greater meaning than the story itself. This manifests itself in the journey of revenge of the orphan prince, but also in the very ways he takes to do so. What Eggers does is bring the myth to the audience while his character lives his own. In a way as crude as it is beautiful, the director takes advantage of all symbolism and senses linked to the Nordic myths to mean his hero's journey, making ""The Northman"" a true epic in the most traditional sense of the term. The plot itself of ""The North Man"" is quite simple. It is the universal history of family revenge, the old archetype of the son's struggle against Usurper Uncle. It is the lion king with Vikings or, if you prefer, a rawer and more brutal version of the classic Hamlet - and, not by chance, the main character is called Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard). But the great asset of the feature is not the originality of its script. Although it is really good, what impresses is the skins with which it wears this structure that is common to us. All the twists and situations presented on Amleth's personal journey are very well built, just as the characters are developed so that you understand each other's motivations and the pains of their losses. At this point, Skarsgard's hero is what draws the most attention. In addition to being the center of this vengeance narrative - something you buy early on, when he is still a child and disappears into the sea with a mantra of hatred and resentment - the way the actor portrays these feelings is impressive. All your gesture in battle incorporates very well the beast he has become over the years and this is critical for you to understand all your actions from that point on. This is where the play between the real and the symbolic made by the director gains much more sense. Just as we see Amleth practically becoming a beast to attack a Slavic village -in an incredible sequence plan -he becomes this spirit of revenge that talks to all the beliefs of that people. And Eggers explores these different layers of significance between characters and viewer to make weight to the madness in which his hero plunges. At the same time, nothing is Manichean and as simple as a children's tale and this is something that even some characters point to Amleth and his naive worldview. Thus, it is easy to understand the motivations of villain Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and even become fond of the character he becomes from a certain moment. If in the previous feature films, especially in ""The Witch"", Eggers seemed much more interested in an atmospheric terror, with a more concerned mise in creating a certain dark and uncertain suggestion in ""The Northman,"" the filmmaker does not demonstrate Any fear of dirty hands. Interest in the mystic remains present, both in scenes that mix dream, prophecy and real, working on legends, such as gods, swords and valuchirias, as when filming smoky or oppressive environments and some very slow dolly in to put us in actions. However, this time, the director seems much more willing to approach the legend as active observers. Thus, there are many plans or even close -ups of the characters, especially the protagonist, played with the savagery needed by Alexander Skarsgard, looking at the camera, suggesting a fourth wall break. It's almost as if the director told the audience: ""I'm seeing you and you will witness this story."" The same is true of the most brutal scenes in the feature, where Eggers makes a point of not hiding anything, either in the fight scenes, that he demonstrates a lot of ability to keep everything in the same long plane, or when filming the torn bodies after the attacks. It is as if, while the director was putting the morale of his protagonist to the test, he also directed his gaze to the public, questioning us, in the position of Voyeur and Judge, if we will continue with this character to the end, which becomes even more interesting when new information about your father is revealed. More than that, the viscerally in ""The North Man"" is so great that it pervades us. When we realize, we are hoping the character to follow his revenge and respond violently a world where there is no room for tenderness, which is represented in the beautiful, and still brutal, moments between Skarsgard and Anya Taylor-Joy. Eggers, who writes the feature alongside Sjón (also responsible for darling Indie Lamb), extracts from this story only the most superficial emotions. The Northman is a movie of fury, of thought, of theatricality. On the way, he slips on the notion that traditional masculinity is dictated by all these things, but is just beyond recognizing it as a cycle of violence, a lineage of nihilism created by the pure coercive force of the spilled blood. Eggers' previous film, the lighthouse, questioned the same themes well, but The Northman does not allow himself to think about himself. The result of this impulse of constant movement and emotion is a shouted but boring blockbuster. A visually resolved movie, but without shadow of the austere plastic flowers from previous Eggers onslaught. The filmmaker has never been a color wizard, but a skilled light and shadow manipulator, a user of extreme close-ups and unlocs, a born observer of intense performances. In ""The Northman"", he has time and money to be all these things, but he does not have the material with which he works significantly. But the great strength of the film is the way it sews historical and symbolic elements to give a very particular weight to its plot. And this is not an easy task, even though director Robert Eggers can balance all these perspectives very well. On the one hand, he brings all the hardness of Scandinavian culture in a very faithful portrait of what these people were still in their first contacts with the rest of Europe. Everything is very gray and brown, marking not only the dirt and desolation of the environment, but the cross of the spirit of these warriors. Not coincidentally, when the action is taken to Iceland and we are presented alongside both Amleth and Fjölnir, photography leaves this grayish tone a little aside and gains some new colors. However, there is also the fantastic side of the thing and all this magical and mystical aspect of Nordic beliefs brings a life that contrasts a lot with the lifeless tone of the worldly. From the representation of the tree of life to the beautiful ride of Valkyrie, the way the mythical side is portrayed lives up to the weight it has in the life of the characters. But the director's hand is not only felt in this relationship in this mythological aspect. At a time when action movies are filled with a frantic edition and full of cuts, there is no way not to be gaping when faced with a camp battle in a sequence where the camera follows the advancement of this half-wolf warrior, half wolf and that makes it clear how fierce he is. These are not special effects that make it this figure unstoppable, only the good old acting with a competent direction."
The Northman (2022),"Boring, useless, not engaging. With nudities.","More than seeing ""secret and sacred"" anatomical parts of the Goddess named Anya Taylor-Joy, this movie doesn't engage that much. The characters speak by infinitives, in a boring aulic way, which completely contrasts with the imagery, which wants to transport the beholders in an ancient and mysterious world of abused people, vikings and pseudo-historic Scandinavian (ancient Rus'-scandinavian) villagers who struggle to survive while a hunchbacked bodybuilt ""son of a great actor"" kills everything that is alive. Splatter here, there and everywhere, breasts, underbelly furs, nonsense visions, on the top of an all-star cast. Maybe some of all that stuff went necessary to justify the costs of such a plot of an abstract of a comic-book... have I already said that there is Anya showing off what we struggled to see for years? All that said, it is worth a view. Once."
The Northman (2022),Boring,"I don't understand how this film achieve 7/10. It is so boring. The editing, the dialogs are really bad. If you compare to films like Conan, you can see how bad is this Viking ""legend"". The actors are not bad, the landscapes are ok, but these things do not save the film. More than two hours of boring sequences, telling us a history that could be explained in fifteen minutes. If you want to save two hours of your life, please, escape from this horrible history. Everything is out of situation. Nothing seems to be right in this Viking saga. Escape, please. Don't waste your time, save for another thing."
The Northman (2022),"Oh boy, where is the story and character development?","I checked the movie on IMDb as it was on offer to rent. A full 7. Unfortunately, I did not make the tour through the comments and I would have known. Oh boy, what a disappointment. This movie lives from its pictures, but even here it sometimes falls short. I think the acting was very good, but the story and character development just poor. The main character remains a strange, angry man with no feelings. The story is very simple with a twist, which is also not that surprising. Its more like a bloodbath through a dark, unfriendly world that confronts the main character with some moral dilemmas. He remains a stranger to the viewer as all other characters in the movie. One rather could feel pity for them all for having to live in such a world. Even the love is frosty in this movie. Where the movie shines most are the scenes, which portray a cold, cruel world with lot's of hardship and little sparks of hope. You can really feel the miserable weather, the cruelty, the hardship and overall coldness of the age. You will appreciate your warm couch and neighbors after having seen this. However, this is not enough for a recommendation. Maybe for historical purists and fans of nordic myths. At least you have been warned."
The Northman (2022),Must watch Highly Recommended,"The Northman is a match made in Heaven that has ventured through Hel and Niflheim to reach us. 'Tis a masterwork of grit and violence that is also contemplative and beautiful; a surely crowd-pleasing action film that can also be unmistakably discerned as the work of modern genius Robert Eggers. The Northman is a match made in Heaven that has ventured through Hel and Niflheim to reach us. 'Tis a masterwork of grit and violence that is also contemplative and beautiful; a surely crowd-pleasing action film that can also be unmistakably discerned as the work of modern genius Robert Eggers. In the film, Eggers captures the beauty and brutality of Nordic folklore -- from the snarling intensity of Alexander Skarsgård to the ethereal mysticism of Björk as The Seeress (plus a far better usage of Iceland as a shooting location than last year's Lamb). What might turn some people off, even those at my local theater who will watch anything with a half-naked Skarsgård family member in it, is the story, which is ""Hamlet all over again"" to anyone who doesn't know just where Shakespeare got the idea for his most mimicked play."
The Great Escape (1963),The Great Escape,"Title: The Great Escape (1963)
Director: John Sturges
Genre: War, Drama, Adventure
The Great Escape is an iconic war film that tells the incredible true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war during World War II. Directed by John Sturges, this 1963 classic has become a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the most beloved films in the genre. The movie follows a group of British and American soldiers who are held captive in a high-security German prison camp. Determined to regain their freedom, they plan an audacious escape attempt. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), known as ""Big X,"" they meticulously devise an elaborate plan to break out of the seemingly impenetrable prison walls. One of the standout aspects of The Great Escape is its ensemble cast, featuring some of Hollywood's finest actors at the time. Steve McQueen delivers a charismatic performance as Captain Virgil Hilts, famously known for his thrilling motorcycle chase scene. James Garner portrays Lieutenant Robert Hendley, adding depth and humor to the narrative. Each character brings a unique personality and skill set to contribute to their shared objective. The film excels in capturing both the camaraderie among the POWs and their relentless determination to reclaim their freedom. It beautifully balances moments of suspense with lighter comedic scenes that provide much-needed relief amidst the tense atmosphere. John Sturges' direction deserves special mention for his ability to create tension-filled sequences without resorting to excessive violence or gore commonly associated with war films. Instead, he focuses on building suspense through meticulous planning and execution while highlighting themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and resilience. Furthermore, The Great Escape boasts impressive production design that transports viewers back in time to WWII-era Germany. From detailed recreations of the prison camp itself to authentic costumes and props, every element adds authenticity and immersion to the story. While some may argue that the film's runtime of over two and a half hours is excessive, it allows for thorough character development and an immersive storytelling experience. The pacing remains consistent throughout, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. In conclusion, The Great Escape is a timeless war film that continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling story, memorable characters, and superb performances. It successfully manages to balance action-packed sequences with moments of heartwarming camaraderie. If you're a fan of war films or simply appreciate well-crafted storytelling, The Great Escape is definitely worth watching."
The Great Escape (1963),The Great Escape,"I do think that this is good, but it falls a little short at becoming what i would consider my top 250. The POW camp for me just comes across as not that bad. It also feels like it is very Hollywood. It is like a bigger Bridge Over the River Kwai, which i also think has similar issues. It's positives are it looks good and feels like a true cinematic experience. It has a very good cast and although Steve McQueen is the top billed star you feel he is equal with Bronson, Attenbrough, Plesence ,Coburn, Garner and co. Also the title music is one of the most whistleable tunes ever made. Overall a good film."
The Great Escape (1963),The antidote to Hogan's Heroes,"I remember seeing The Great Escape on TV all those years ago, at a time where there was much resentment against the Japanese because of world war two, but I think that resentment and racism didn't quite extend to the Germans/N@zis and their ilk in world war two, hence The Great Escape isn't really Tora! Tora! Tora! And pearl harbor. Anyway, the ending was very tragic with 50 of the British (UK) and Americans (not sure about Canadians) being summarily executed on the spot by the n@zis which pretty much broke every war convention in the book. The Great Escape ain't Hogan's Heroes that's for sure."
The Great Escape (1963),Truly iconic and exciting adventure,"This iconic and classic adventure film for the ages is definitely deserving of all the praise it has gotten, including its spot on IMDb's prestigious 250 list for many, many years and decades. Starring an ever iconic cast with Steve McQueen among others, they are all truly outstanding and every actor does an incredible job. It's filled with great dialogue, great humour and drama. The cinematography, cutting and editing is splendid - and it is very beautifully put together, very beautifully shot and with some truly iconic set pieces. The score is, of course, also incredible and truly iconic. Indeed one of the better films of all time, and one you will find yourself returning to time and time again!"
The Great Escape (1963),Epic,"One of the very few instances where a 3 hour film doesn't get boring at all, this is rightfully an epic war feature packed with interesting characters, subplots, lots of adventures and thrills, you name it. The film is smart, funny, exciting, suspenseful and pretty all at the same time. To top it all, you are provided with some of the best Steve McQueen stunts he did on pictures. Another thing, I adored the treatment the Germans got in this. They speak their own language (yep), they are civilized, respectful and don't look like devilish fiends. I just wish we got more of that perspective in WW films."
The Great Escape (1963),A must see and definitely worth re-watching,"Wow, what a great cast including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, David McCallum, and Hannes Messemer. Based on a true story of a mass escape of prisoners from a German Stalag in 1944, it is still fascinating watching the prisoners plot to escape. And, of course, there is that fantastic motorcycle chase with Steve McQueen (that didn't really happen - McQueen insisted that he had to be able to showcase his motorcycle skills or he wouldn't do the film!). Other characters were composites, but the main part of the story is close to the real events, and they used a real survivor of the camp as a technical consultant. And Donald Pleasance was eminently qualified to be POW since he was one in real life! He did say in an interview that prisoners were not as rude to heavily armed guards as in the movie - I think I would be polite to a guy with a Schmeiser submachine gun too! A great film that is definitely worth re-watching (or for the first time, if by some chance you never saw it!). 8/10."
The Great Escape (1963),A great escape but where were they going?,I've seen this movie many times but I scratch my head wondering where were they going. They spent a lot of time planning and building but they seem to give little thought where they were going once they escaped. Not one escapee got out of Germany. A majority of them were captured and many were caught and executed. I don't get it. Even with hogans heroes the prisoners at stalag 17 had a place in mind when they helped someone escape. For me this supposed true story diminished in its appeal when the escapees failed to get out of Germany. They spent so much time determining who would go and making sure the would end in area where the guards couldn't see them. They were a little off. I was hoping one of them would get out of Germany. That wasn't meant to be.
The Great Escape (1963),One of the best World War II films ever made,"This movie is fantastic, from the all star cast to the brilliant storytelling to the amazing soundtrack, this movie has everything you could want in a great movie. I loved the fact that some of the actors in the movie (Pleasence, Garner, Coburn, etc) actually did serve in the real war back then and the fact that Donald Pleasence actually was a real prisoner of war just added to the realism of the story. While some details are a little bit different compared to the actual events, it's still a brilliant depiction of the real story. Also the famous Steve McQueen motorcycle scene was awesome too. 10/10 stars and I would definitely recommend it!"
The Great Escape (1963),Good Luck,"From delightfully hilarious to unjustly cruel, The Great Escape is an all-time classic of cinema for a reason. Spectacularly entertaining it serves as a rousing ode to the determination, camaraderie and courage of everyday heroes. The truth behind the tale only adds to that sheer level of excitement while marvelling at the ingenuity and seemingly unbreakable spirit of imprisoned soldiers. For all its moments of terror and tragedy, is to delight in captivity in times of war as a wonderful game for boys, an endless Houdini challenge to slip through the enemy's fingers. Topped by its amazing all-star cast of loveable greats, the expert direction of John Sturges, eminently hummable Elmer Bernstein score, and rip-roaring stunts, The Great Escape is simply great escapism."
The Great Escape (1963),Ya vas lyublyu. The Great POW escape film.,"This is the ultimate Second World War, Prisoner Of War escape film. Forget your Escape to Victory (1981) or Von Ryan's Express (1965) this is it! Why, let's run through the film. 1. Cast. Probably the greatest ensemble cast of Hollywood and Commonwealth acting talent ever put to film (or good use anyway). Be it the Commonwealth/British acting talent of the likes of Richard Attenborough or Hollywood heavyweights such as Steve McQueen and James Garner. Add the likes of Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and others. The list is endless. Their characters all have a vital role in the operation, hence their nicknames in the film such as The Tunnel King or The Scrounger..... 2. Music. A rousing score by Elmer Bernstein that is still revered to this day. 3. Length. This film is long, approximately 172 minutes. Just below epic length. It allows for all the facets of the escape operation to be played out in all their glory. Every dollar/pound or whatever is on the screen. 4. Historical accuracy. Okay some of the more pedantic reviews may sniff about the historical accuracy but the main events happened. There is some artistic licence added to the screenplay no doubt but in what Hollywood production isn't there? 5, The poster doesn't have little boxes of the stars faces that is so often the case in films with multiple star attractions but is ultimately a let down! Good marketing in my opinion. If I have any complaints with the film (albeit minor) it is the last act featuring the escape aftermath. A completely unnecessary sequence showcasing stunt motorcycling by Steve McQueen seems tagged into the screenplay? If you have a spare three hours watch this film (you probably have at some stage so enjoy it again)."
The Book of Clarence (2023),It lost me in the 3rd act,"Imagine The Life of Brian ending with dire seriousness, rather than a joyously silly ending with the crucified singing from their crosses. This film evolved from something I enjoyed to something I would avoid. There were new ideas explored in the first two acts, and there were genuine laughs. For example, there was a slapstick scene with John the Baptist I found particularly funny. The colours were saturated, and the Italian town standing in for Jerusalem was impressive. The musical score was developed by the writer/director, and it added humour at times. I didn't expect to see choreographed disco dancing in first century Jerusalem. However, in the third act, the film changes course and tone. The film turns earnest, and there is a miraculously ""happy"" ending. It was such a disappointment. The writer/director comes across as a true believer recruiting for the faith. If it had held its tone and retained its healthy scepticism, I would have rated it. Unfortunately, the third act turns deadly serious, and is more The Passion of the Christ than The Life of Brian. It was jarring and out of step with the rest of the film."
The Book of Clarence (2023),life of LaKeith!,"This movie was an interesting take on making a camp, religious mix. Lakeith was incredible (obviously), especially toward the end as the film grew more emotional. Omar Sy was also a phenom as a stoic side character. Many jokes landed, but the script did not. Many of the female characters were quite one dimensional (although that may be due to the time period of it). Some of the allegories the film attempted to make were forced. The slapstick comedy with religion was pretty clever, but it didn't make up for a lot of the unexplained hijinks throughout the film. Although, it did make some great, hilarious use of both McAvoy and Cumberbatch in some minor yet great roles. Jeymes Samuel certainly has unique visions and a place in the future of filmmaking, but for me, this one fell a little short."
The Favourite (2018),History rewritten,"Start with the positive. The acting is quite good the scenes are beautiful. There was in fact a rivalry between Baroness Abigail and Lady Sarah Churchill. Yes Lord Marlborough and his wife were the historic ancestors of Winston Churchill. Marlborough was one of the great generals of his era, but his wars nearly bankrupted Britain. But the rest is just an excuse to tell a pornographic joke. It is very unlikely that poor Queen Anne after 17 miscarriages and wracked by disease had the energy, or desire to carry on two torrid lesbian love. Also she was reputed to be a woman of conventional morals. By the way her husband Prince George was still around and lived with his wife, Where was he when all this was going on? Also Sarah's husband Marlborough had strong politcal opposition, but he after the ""events"" depicted in the film he did manage to build Blenheim Palace, the ancestral Churchill home, Alright maybe no-one cares about 18th century history, but this is just modern trash attempting to normalize a cynical hyper sexualized Hollywood world view . I'm just tired of it no matter how pretty the package is."
The Favourite (2018),HAHHAHAHA what?,"Well, who knew a lesbian story set during imperial England could be so funny. Indeed The Favourite surprises because it is excellently written, never shying away from anachronistic vulgarities and a honest but painfully brash and hilarious sense of humour. For Lanthimos, this is probably standard stuff. But by mainstream Hollywood conventions, this is bold, creative, and inventively funny. The backstabs, the plotting, the connivance are all approach is a cynically funny way. The Favourite is also perhaps notable for being a film where the females are the ones in power. The trio of leading women are all excellent in their portrayals. Olivia Colman is wonderful as Queen Anne, playing an unhinged, infantile, and uninterested queen. She is emotionally unstable but extremely powerful- the worst combination for her subordinates, but the best combination for our entertainment. Rachel Weisz is likewise brilliant as the conniving, scheming Lady Marlborough. Marlborough is the secret puppeteer who pulls the queens strings and her approach is evil, almost Machiavellian in her manipulation of the queen. But perhaps the most fascinating character is Abigail, played by the magnificent Emma Stone. The story could be seen as the transformation of the initially meek Abigail into a plotting, morally bankrupt schemer who becomes the queens Favourite. Initially Abigail plots to ensure her continued survival, but her lust for power eventually turns her into something more sinister. I think to say Lanthimos is a unconventional director would be a massive understatement. But The Favourite, crazy as it is, is genuinely funny, dripping with wry cynicism, and very enjoyable. This film has a great deal of mainstream appeal, and is a pleasure to watch."
The Favourite (2018),Can not recommend this movie.,"I did not like this movie. Just watch Soviet movie ""Glass of water"" (1979). The same persons, the same place, but it was made like fairytale or like a dream. Main heroes: Alla Demidova (Sarah Churchill) and Natalya Belokhvostikova (Queen Anna) are absolutely gorgeous women and 100 times smarter. Scenes between Sarah Churchill and Lord Bolingbrock (Kirill Lavrov) are pure delight. As for this movie, it is just naturalistic and ugly stuff, made about parodies of human beings. I can agree, that it is much closer to the real story and real persons but I managed to watch only 20 minutes, then get bored and turned TV off."
The Favourite (2018),boring and very predictable scenario,"I really don't understand who gave this movie 7.5 points, it was incredibly boring. Moving toooooooooooo slow..... I was about to sleep...... I understand this is an art film but the plot is not creative at all....... I don't think it's worth watchi.......... the actors are really good... but It's not enough to cover up the dullness of the movie... so I want my 2 hours back.... The scenes were nice but that's not enough too... I think the same topic could have been covered in a shorter time... Even though it took so long, I couldn't understand what was happening in some scenes..... Just not worth watching..."
The Favourite (2018),Too normal for a real Lanthimos.,"Yorgos Lanthimos is well known for absurd movies such as ""The lobster"" (2015) and ""The killing of a sacred deer"" (2017). It is almost a surprise when he makes a rather (but not completely) normal movie. ""The favourite"" (2018) is such a movie. Unlike his previous two films, ""The favourite"" is definitely a genre movie, the genre being a costume drama and the subgenre a film about the English royal family. With respect to the costume drama's the film reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975, Stanley Kubrick), especially in the beautiful way it covers candle light, which was of course a much harder to do in 1975 than in 2018. With respect to films about the English royal family I immediately think about Shakespeare adaptations. This association is not fully unjustified because, just like a Shakespeare adaptation, the film is all about palace intrigues. The only difference is that in this case the intrigues are between three women. This is not without importance because it gives the film a touch of the flavor of ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph L. Mankiewicz). The story is about Queen Anne (1655 - 1714), but does not claim any historical accuracy. Queen Anne is in poor health and entrusts government activities to her adviser Sarah Churchill. During the film the position of Sarah is challenged by her impoverished cousin Abighail Hill. So the fight is not about being King / Queen, like in so many royal dramas, but about the possibility to manipulate the reigning Queen. See also ""A royal affair"" (2012, Nikolaj Arcel). The risk of such a fight is thet you can never be sure that you have really won. In my opinion that is the message from the much criticized final scene. The one who thought she has won finds out that the Queen can not always be manipulated in the desired direction. Queen Anne is played by Olivia Colman, Sarah Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and Abighail Hill is played by Emma Stone. All of them are giving a terrific performance. My ""favourite"" is Olivia Colman, portraying Queen Anne as vulnerable at some times, headstrong at other times but at no time caricatured. Olivia Colman got an Oscar for actress in a leading role, the other two ""only"" got a nomination for actress in a supporting role. Many reviewers mention the good performance of the lead actresses. Apart from their own merit this is also attributable to the more natural dialogue compared to earlier films of Lanthimos. I do agree with these reviewers, but strangely enough this is one of the reasons I prefer those earlier films. ""The favourite"" is just too normal for a real Lanthimos."
The Favourite (2018),The Feature Film in its Senescence,"When an art form is dying it hangs on for for dear life, insisting on survival with despairing denial. The feature film dethroned the novel as the culturally dominant storytelling form in the middle of the last century. Now, of course, it has lost that exalted throne to peak TV. But there's always a lag time and money to made pretending that the Empress's clothes are exquisite. This is the worst sort of movie--high pretentious. The script abounds with witling tit-for-tat wisecracks learned from sitcoms, not good ones. There are puerile anachronisms that should embarrass the filmmakers, though they may be immune. Perhaps they calculate: it doesn't really matter what we write. The costumes and history and all the snobbery about English accents will get us a win in Los Angeles. What an artistically bankrupt enterprise. The Favourite pretends to be a deep, intelligent study of how character shapes history, a nations' destiny--of how desire injects power with purpose, discovering political meaning. The creators of this shallow crap no doubt read great novels, saw great movies when they were young. So they aspire to greatness, but lack the mind or honest inclination, really. They just want to be SEEN as great. That wins awards! Awards tell you what you should revere. And there were feature films deserving of it, in the past. But now the prestige awards are lavished on outright junk like '3 Billboards,"" for example, and this stupefying sub-mediocrity. It's almost feels like a betrayal: didn't our reverence for Sunset Blvd, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, mean anything? How could this stand with them? Giving this an Oscar is like handing the Nobel Prize for literature to Dean Koontz. Sorry Dean. I know your are a far superior writer than the hacks who penned this rubbish."
The Favourite (2018),A Deconstruction of human's Self Preservation.,"In 'The Favourite' Yorgos Lanthimos manages to pull off one of the best character studies I've seen in a film. One desperate to make a mark, desperate to be seen and acknowledged, clouded by their thirst for power, turns to manipulation and deception to gain control. One, who has been stripped of all dignity, in a Last-ditch effort at self prevention will employ every possible strategy often acting ""in ways that meet the edges of their morality"" to ensure they survive. One with so much repressed guilt, surrounded by human leeches, and slowly gives in to their emotional emptiness. Three impeccable performance and a masterful direction from Yorgos Lanthimos, with georgous wide long takes, and you have one of the best films I've ever seen."
The Favourite (2018),"Very Well Shot, Scored and Acted, not Very Interesting","Beautiful shots of masterfully crafted costumes and sets with well-rounded performances in a long and boring film. Conveying emotions in a drawn-out way is fine, but for it to make a good movie, they need to be much more gripping or relatable. There is no familiarity or urgency here, but there is some light-hearted fun, in rare patches. The performances of the three lead women truly immerses you in story you really don't want to spend this much time in. The absurd world of detached English aristocrats and a story of intertwined political/personal intrigue could and should be the focus of two different movies, there isn't much synergy in them here. There probably isn't a much better way to present this story, it just doesn't seem too much of a story, but if you're really set on making a period piece, it might as well be this one."
The Favourite (2018),no,"""The Favourite""left me utterly bewildered and questioning the hype surrounding it. This so-called period drama seemed more interested in indulging in bizarre and awkward scenarios than in crafting a coherent and engaging storyline. From the very beginning, the film's attempts at humor felt forced and uncomfortable. The over-the-top antics of the characters, particularly the Queen and her courtiers, came across as juvenile rather than witty. Instead of creating a genuine sense of intrigue and tension within the palace, the film relied on cringe-worthy moments,
The characters themselves were a collection of unlikable individuals whose motivations often seemed perplexing and inconsistent. It's as if the film expected the audience to root for characters who were more interested in scheming and manipulation than in any semblance of relatability or depth. The visual style of the film, while certainly unique, bordered on distracting. The fish-eye lens shots and excessive use of wide-angle cinematography detracted from the storytelling rather than enhancing it. It was as if the film was trying to be avant-garde for the sake of being avant-garde, without considering the impact on the viewer's experience. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was that the film lacked any semblance of emotional resonance. Rather than drawing the audience into the lives and struggles of the characters, ""The Favourite"" kept them at arm's length, preventing any meaningful connection. In the end, ""The Favourite"" struck me as a confusing and pretentious attempt at storytelling. It failed to deliver the depth, substance, and emotional engagement that I expect from a period drama. Instead, it left me wondering why it garnered the acclaim it did and left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and confusion."
The Favourite (2018),Incredible storytelling!,"People always appreciate Yorgos Lanthimos for his pristine sense of shot structure and his ambitious direction. However, people often pay no heed to his tremendous narrating talent; Lanthimos' apodictic cinematographic expertise repeatedly overshadows his ingrained capacity to tell stories in a compelling fashion. Yes, his pictorial mastery is something to wonder at. Still, we should also admire his storytelling craft, as he had always done exceptionally well in that regard, too, irrespective of the script he opted to make a film on! And the way he gives different shades and layers to the characters makes me wonder that he might fall into the list of those very few filmmakers who have perfected their method of developing their entire character ensemble. ""The Favourite"" is no exception. Just like his other works, it is a tale that is enriched with some glorious costumes, set designs and, most notably, dynamic characters who are meticulously imbued with solid arcs and indubitable motivations. And to add to that excellence, some incredible acts were bestowed upon us from all around, with Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone taking most of the limelight. Yeah, this was an entertaining ride!"
BlackBerry (2023),Great Film about Tech Companies and Greed,"Blackberry is a great film that tracks the rise and fall of the Blackberry smartphone through a captivating plot and great acting. Glenn Howerton does a fantastic job playing Jim - a ruthless business executive that takes a poorly run engineering firm and turns it into the leader of the cell phone category. However, Jim is ultimately corrupt as he takes part in illegal business practices and does not truly care about the product as he is more interested in the perks of being CEO and trying to own a hockey team. The movie does a great job of showing how Jim's corruption slowly, slowly eats away at the company and demoralizes the colleagues around him. Jay Baruchel delivers a strong performance as his character Mike undergoes a transformation from geeky tech nerd to confident business executive. Ultimately, this is a fast-paced film that delivers a lesson about the need for strong character in the business world."
BlackBerry (2023),Entertaining off-kilter ficitionalized version of events,"Right at the top, BLACKBERRY notes that it is a 'fictionalization' even though it's based on a non-fiction book and names names. Straight off, one can see that the tone will be off-kilter. Director, Co-Writer (with Matthew Miller) and Co-star Matt Johnson takes a freaks and geeks approach to the pair of inventors who co-founded a relatively small Canadian tech company, Research In Motion, Mike Lazaridis (Jay Barechel) and Doug Fregin (Johnson). A pitch meeting gone bad to a much larger firm, nevertheless ends up attracting the interest of a mid-level executive who sees potential in their idea for what would become the title device. Jim Basillie (Glen Howerton) is portrayed as an over-the-top shark who takes advantage of the boys' naivete. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Jared Raab's jittery camera, Jay McCarrol's dynamic score and several choice song cuts by the likes of Joy Division, The Strokes and Elastica create a feeling of semi-controlled chaos as the modest firm eventually creates what can now be termed the first Smartphone. It's success leads to it being nicknamed the 'Crackberry'. The screenplay stays focused on the business end. Save for a very brief scene in Basillie's then modest home, the characters have no personal lives to speak of. Women are barely scene (so much so, that Johnson makes an amusing visual jab out of it). Johnson also is smart to tone down the frenetic camera and editing once the movie gets more serious (it is a rise AND fall story after all). The cast is quite good here despite the lack of any real backstory. Howerton in particular relishes his Type A scene chewing. Michael Ironside has a loud supporting role as an operations manager who takes particular delight in knocking down the tech nerds a peg - calling them ""children'. BLACKBERRY is as deep as a detailed text (something with Blackberry first made practical), and inaccuracies abound, but it's a highly enjoyable rags to riches story. It may not be a 'just the facts version of events' -- but, it does entertain, and most importantly, it does get at the 'truth' in it's own skewed way. Note: This is a review of the feature film version, not the AMC mini-series edition."
BlackBerry (2023),Strong Performances lost to Confusing Storytelling,"""BlackBerry,"" starring Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel, is a compelling portrayal of a tech giant's rise and struggles. Howerton and Baruchel excel in their roles, bringing a remarkable depth and realism to their characters. Their acting stands as a highlight in a film marred by a slow pace and a narrative that can often be confusing. The film's treatment of crucial plot points feels rushed, glossing over significant events and leaving the audience wanting more. Particularly, it misses the opportunity to delve deeply into the seismic shift caused by the iPhone's emergence, a pivotal moment in tech history that deserved more attention. Moreover, an intriguing subplot, which is only briefly touched upon, is Jim Balsillie's audacious but ultimately failed attempt to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins. This episode alone could have been a riveting storyline, deserving of its own cinematic exploration. It's a missed opportunity that could have added an exciting dimension to the film. In summary, ""BlackBerry"" earns a 6 out of 10. It's a film with exceptional acting and a fascinating subject but falls short in pacing and narrative clarity, and it doesn't fully capture the dramatic impact of its real-life events."
BlackBerry (2023),So Bad We Thought Perhaps They Were Trying To Be Funny,"We decided to watch based on some good review numbers. Perhaps we were too early (12/21/2023), and the real reviews hadn't come in yet? Everything about this movie is bad. It was shocking how bad this movie is. I'm sorry Fellas, but the acting is more akin to a YouTube video some local teens made criticizing the city council (i.e. A Tour of Beautiful Robbinsdale Part II, highly recommended). That is to say, the acting is piss poor. Mostly it seemed like they just had the camera up and rolling and the a-team was out there just improvising their lines. Like, for entire scenes. The one dudes fake bald hair cut was bad (although not as bad as his embarrassing over-the-top performance), the skin color was not matched, and so it just always looks like a guy with a bald head spot shaved in. The dialogue was bad. No one talks like that. And also, the dialogue was stupid. How embarrassing to have to deliver such lines. (Some of the dialogue was so bad that in order to enjoy it we had to perceive it as hilarious. At times it was so bad we were inclined to go back and record bits of it with the cell phone so we could make it into a hilarious ringtone or something. But then we opted out of that because we would just end up having to back and watch parts of this stupid movie over again.)
Regarding dialogue, the fake bald guy is easily the worst, but nothing is as funny as him briskly walking up to an airplane, clapping his hands impatiently, and shouting ""C'mon! Let's go!""
So dumb. Lastly, the entire story, about unethical businesspeople, en masse, screwing us all out of whatever for a buck, gets drowned, even as dumb as it is, in its own stupid little story. That is to say, who cares about these fu**s? Not me. I don't care about anything in this movie, a movie that can only be described as bad. And dumb, and also stupid. And poorly acted, and hilariously poorly written. SEE THIS MOVIE! But maybe watch it as a comedy about people who make a dumb movie."
BlackBerry (2023),There's a Lesson Here,"I really enjoyed this film even if it lacks veracity according to some viewers. I don't know what happened specifically as the new century began, but I do know that my friend Phil stopped using a pencil to take notes. Instead, out came the stylus and his Blackberry. They were everywhere and I felt like a neanderthal because I didn't have one. The portrayal of Nerd Central was quite funny and I got a kick out of their childish behavior. At first it was rather distracting. Then we got to see what amazing technicians they were. But they were eventually victimized by the lack of vision of their bosses. Also, money really talks and the competition is roiling around them the whole time and they aren't cognizant of some of it. This is a sleeper and well worth the time."
BlackBerry (2023),The rapid rise then rapid fall of the Blackberry smart phone.,"The opening script on the screen states that this movie is a fictional account of real events and real people. Some of the main characters are portrayed a bit different from reality and most of the dialog had to be fabricated but to be consistent with what transpired. From my brief research it seems the story in the movie pretty well follows what happened. Me? I never owned a Blackberry, apparently named for the tiny keyboard resembling the surface of a ripe Blackberry. Research In Motion (RIM) was founded in the 1980s by two friends in Canada. The company was involved in any number of electronics contracts. But 1999 was their banner year when the Blackberry 850, a pager with a keyboard, was introduced. Then in 2002 their first smart phone, the BlackBerry 5810, hit the market. It was an instant success and quickly dominated the market for smart phones. What the RIM people didn't know was in 2007 and 2008 Steve Jobs and Apple were developing a next generation of smart phone with a touch screen pad and additional capabilities. Failing to keep up, the Blackberry share of the market went from almost 50% to less than 1% rather quickly. All this is depicted rather interestingly and entertainingly in this movie. The rise and the fall of the Blackberry. To add to the realism of ""being there"" hand-held cameras are often used. For me it is a totally enjoyable movie, it shows how quickly a company can rise and then fall in the cutthroat competition of the digital device world. Good movie. At home on DVD from our public library, my wife only lasted half-way through, she didn't care for it."
BlackBerry (2023),Shaky Business,"I tried to watch this movie on an intercontinental flight from Bangkok to Amsterdam. I stopped after 15minuten, because I became totally sick. Sick, not of the bumpy flight, but of the continuous moving and shaking camera (including out of focus setting). I don't know why they the choose this type of recording, it's not hip, arty or modern. This movie ruined my complete flight. Can there be a warning before the movie starts, like the the announcement for flashing lights triggering elliptic insults. This movie makes you totally sick. I recommend not to watch this movie. Blackberry is shaky business."
BlackBerry (2023),Interesting but unrealistic,"The series has no connection with reality. I knew both men, who would graciously come talk to my classes at Wilfrid Laurier University. Jim is a polite, urbane gentleman with an MBA from Harvard. Mike is a reclusive, generous genius. I am from Waterloo, Ontario. The series has absolutely no bearing. Even the ""location"" scenes are concocted. There is little I can relate to. As an exercise in fiction, and given the made up characters and context, the series is still interesting. CBC obviously did not care about living up to standards of journalistic integrity however. I cannot stress this enough."
BlackBerry (2023),A simple and true story that has it all,"This seems to be the year of the product movie. Whether it is Tetris or Nike or even Hot Cheetos, every famous product from the 90s seems to need its own movie backstory. And yet...this one feels different. Because you are never quite sure who to cheer for and because the story taps into much more than nostalgia (like humor and stakes and character arcs) by letting the audience watch the rise AND the fall. It felt way less like an advertisement, and way more like real human drama. It is both triumphant and tragic all at once. The story pacing works, and the actors pull it off; I was cheering by the first half and shaking my head by the end, just like they wanted."
BlackBerry (2023),Good until it wasn't,"This was an interesting look into the technological craziness that was the BlackBerry before Apple took over and things went a whole new direction with smartphones. I'll say this as I do with a lot of movies. You can gain attention with marketing and promo stuff through the streamers and thru platforms like til tok but the movies have to have more than a 15 minutes window of intrigue. This is a perfect example where I saw a TikTok , thought it looked good, watched it and loved the first half, but then got bored as hell and bailed. Need to understand that interest in this ""gimme now"" instant gratification culture at least has to have some consistent interesting content the whole way thru."
Braveheart (1995),It's a Subjective Thing,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart."" Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on. ""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace. The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others. Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often. ""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them. So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died. Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV. I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy. Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation. At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead."
Braveheart (1995),Mythologization,"Mel Gibson's second directed feature is a big, brash effort at mythologization of a historical figure that is a sweeping entertainment that gets all of the narrative details right while leaving the actual history a complete mess. I don't care, this is such a wonderful entertainment that its large detours from actual history simply don't bother me. Did Randall Wallace, the screenwriter, and Gibson know that the Battle of Stirling Bridge involved a bridge? You betcha. Did it matter to this mythmaking adventure? Nope, so they dropped it. What about the whole thing about the Princess of Wales actually just being a child in France at the time? Well, you don't get the grand romance of the second half without her, so in she goes, all adult and pretty. It's largely ahistorical nonsense in the details (getting the 30,000 foot few of the events largely correct), but the entertainment is the point. And the entertainment is good. The story of the First Scottish War for Independence begins with Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) and his brutal efforts to tamp down on Scottish sentiment against English rule by killing the men willing to fight, including the father of William Wallace (Gibson) who goes off to learn the world with his uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), returning as a young adult (Gibson doesn't look much like a young adult, to be honest) to raise a farm and a family. His childhood friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson) is happy to challenge him to feats of strength at the wedding that Wallace wanders into, all while Wallace catches the eye of Murron (Catherine McCormack). There's a quick romance, they marry in secret to save them from sending her to the local lord for his sexual rights through prima nocta (ahistorical, but whatever), and she is murdered by the local magistrate when an English soldier tries to rape her, Wallace defends her, and she gets captured to lure him out. So begins the rabble-rousing inception to the rebellion against the English presence in Scotland, a mixture of personal and ideological reasons that led him into a fight that was brimming across the country for a while that Wallace sparked. That the personal reason is intimately tied into the ideological one around the ""rape, theft, and murder"" of England against Scotland that matches what happened to Wallace through Murron. It's the basic narrative storytelling that Gibson showed strong grasping of throughout his career, up through Apocalypto and Hacksaw Ridge. The opening half hour of romance flows naturally through to the rest of the film filled with battles. The battles get going after some expert setup of the situation as we watch Longshanks deal with his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) and his daughter-in-law Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) while Wallace is introduced to Scottish politics through mainly Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) whose father (Ian Brennan), is scheming on every side of every event, working towards Robert becoming king of Scotland. The nobles are constantly trying to get out of fights to negotiate for to increase their own lands. It's Wallace who comes into the situation, injecting it with a healthy dose of populist appeal for freedom (a gauzy use of the word that is more explicitly about Scotland being ruled by Scots...the same Scot lords that are constantly trying to sell out their people but more implicitly the Lockean ideal of personal liberty) that gets the people behind the revolt. And the battles are grandly staged. Before CGI gave us CGI armies, Mel Gibson dressed a few hundred people up in different uniforms and threw them at each other before going down the Chimes at Midnight route of capturing small snippets of battle to imply larger action through editing. The battles don't match to reality all that much (Stirling is missing the bridge, and the fire stuff at Falkirk is borderline nonsense), but they're incredibly well-filmed, staged, and they serve their narrative purposes very well. Stirling is Wallace's rise, and Falkirk is Wallace's fall, and it all comes together rather perfectly. The mythologization of Wallace has to include his martyrdom for the cause which, thankfully, has some basis in the reality of how Wallace actually died. I think it could have pushed the reality a bit further since Wallace ended up being one of the only prominent Scots who, after a series of battles leading to English dominance, refused to mark allegiance to the English crown, making him a particular object of hate for Longshanks. Instead, the film has him go on a course of vengeance against the Scottish nobles that betrayed him on the Falkirk battlefield, never quite getting far up enough in the chain to get to Robert the Bruce who convinces him to come in for talks, leading to his ultimate capture. It's really amazing how well all of this works and comes together, and a lot of that has to do with the actors. Gibson is a strong actor who became one of the biggest movie stars in the world, and he directs himself reasonably well, maintaining his accent strongly. He is a rootable underdog who has solid reasons for fighting his unwinnable fight, and Gibson is largely working on his charm. The rest of the cast is very good. Gibson is a very good actors' director, and he brings out great stuff from everyone involved from Marceau's woundedness and vulnerability turning into a veiled strength to Gleeson's bravado mixed with his earnest concern for Wallace's safety to David O'Hara as Stephen the Irishman and his mixture of being touched by God and vulgar and concerned as well. It's a very strong ensemble cast in support of Gibson's central character that helps fill out the edges of the action with detailed performances and adding to the overall verisimilitude. Gibson made a triumph of a film. A rousing entertainment that brought David Lean scale up to the 90s sensibilities filled with wonderful performances, well-filmed with a strong eye towards composition, and told on an epic scale. I think I might have been a bit torn about whether to vote for this or Apollo 13 for the Best Picture Oscar had I been a voter at the time, but Braveheart winning doesn't feel like any kind of steal. It feels earned."
Braveheart (1995),Mel Gibson,"The famous Mel Gibson film, which won five Oscars, including the best picture, and influenced subsequent films, is the second film directed by Mel Gibson, who is also the producer and the leading actor. He gave an excellent performance in the role of William Wallace, apart from him, Angus Macfadyen and David O'Hara also stood out with their performances. Catherine McCormack stood out with her pure beauty. Returning to his village years later, William Wallace marries his childhood sweetheart and begins to live a quiet life. When the English killed his wife, the fire of rebellion started by Wallace, who was burning with revenge, spread throughout Scotland and turned into a war of freedom against Edward Long-Legged. Despite its long duration, the movie never gets boring, it is very fluid and the music was very good. Even though some extras and mistakes are noticeable, the battle scenes were successful. Even though long-legged Edward makes people hate him, he fulfills his duty as a statesman well, and the words he said about his son, ""Even seeing my son will encourage the enemy to invade the whole country"" were also funny."
Braveheart (1995),Fake,"Oh, no! Hollywood makes historical movies about other countries and everything feels so Hollywoodized! Overexposed! The characters look perfect and everyone is EITHER GOOD OR BAD. NOT average. Forced scenes to make everything seem more epic and at the same time deceptive and unrealistic. Nothing to do with the real story. If it was a fiction on another planet, I might have liked it a bit more and still not as much. Technically the film is very good. The acting is great, but everything as an idea behind the whole project for me is total fake and nonsense. I didn't like it at all! Final score: 3/10."
Braveheart (1995),The ultimate Anglo Saxon tale!,"As is the case with all great movies, they have great sound tracks and Braveheart sets the scene in that regard from the very beginning. Medieval Scotland and England are faithfully and believably portrayed and we are immediately immersed in that time period, along with the tyranny and barbarity of that period, especially on the part of the English King. Braveheart is a hero movie and the hero can only be as great as the villain. Patrick McGoohan excels in this regard, especially in his declaring of Prima Nocta. His character could be the poster boy for anyone who wants to promote democracy - no one man (like this) should wield great power. Mel Gibson was born for this role - he is utterly outstanding. His girl/wife is the ultimate, extremely marryable angel. The support cast is solid but this is a Gibson vs McGoohan movie and that's all it needs. A hugely immersive movie that will keep you intrigued and on the edge of your seat from start to finish, constantly jumping from despair to satisfaction and back again - a must see!"
Braveheart (1995),Rebel Yell,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood. We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people. For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible nobility, in particular the treachery of the future Scottish hero - King, Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen. Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since."
Braveheart (1995),Braveheart: An Evaluation of an Epic Historical Drama,"The film effectively transports the viewers to the atmosphere and historical details of 13th-century Scotland. Mel Gibson's acting and directing make the film even more captivating. Additionally, James Horner's film score adds to the emotional intensity. ""Braveheart"" is known for its battle scenes, especially the epic confrontations between the Scots led by William Wallace and the English. These scenes provide unforgettable moments with stunning visual effects and action. However, the film tends to play with history and deviates from some historical facts. The real-life of William Wallace might not have been as romanticized as portrayed in the film. Additionally, the Scottish independence war and the motivations of the characters are somewhat dramatized."
Braveheart (1995),"Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love","I recently revisited Braveheart (1995) on Max. The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom. Directed by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull). Every aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film. In conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love. I would confidently rate it a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
Braveheart (1995),For Braveheart,"An enduring epic story
A film that is free for every person and every person who is concerned about happiness, growth and excellence should watch this masterpiece. It may always fail, get killed and die in the right appearance, but the blood is holy and it finally wins over blackness and oppression, and this movie expresses this truth. This movie is always fresh and new with its dialogues
I have watched it many times since I was 10 years old, and I have practiced epic and bravery with its unique song. For me, who lives in the Middle East, this story is a bit repetitive, because the history of my country is full of epics and arrogance, and when I see that epics and efforts to save our countrymen are sacred everywhere in the world, my hope for the future of human life increases, we are not supposed to destroy the world. Let's blacken each other, but we are going to establish the best kind of human life on earth one day."
Braveheart (1995),"Beautiful movie, with an amazing soundtrack","Braveheart is a movie that will stir your emotions and inspire your imagination. It is a movie that tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish hero who fought for his country's freedom from the tyranny of the English king. The movie is directed by and stars Mel Gibson, who delivers a powerful and passionate performance as Wallace. The movie is a visual feast, with breathtaking scenes of the Scottish countryside and epic battles. The movie also has a magnificent score by James Horner, who creates a haunting and stirring soundtrack that captures the spirit and mood of the movie. The movie features some of the most memorable and iconic scenes in cinema history, such as Wallace's speech before the Battle of Stirling, his romance with Princess Isabelle, and his final cry of ""freedom"" before his execution. The movie is not a faithful adaptation of history, but rather a fictionalized and romanticized version of it. The movie takes many liberties and inaccuracies with the historical facts, such as Wallace's relationship with Isabelle, his role in the Battle of Falkirk, and his use of blue face paint. However, the movie is not meant to be a documentary, but rather a legend, a myth, and a tribute to the spirit of freedom and resistance. Braveheart is a movie that deserves its five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and gasp. It is a movie that will stay with you long after it ends. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking that you should not miss."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Does the good outweight the bad this time around?,"This adaptation of the classic tale is yet again conflicted as it comes to the good that it brings and the bad that arrives with it. Thus far, I hold the 1970's version by Lester as a pinnacle in The Three Musketeers adaptations, and - unfortunately - this latest attempt does not threaten its throne. The negatives included the dark-toned costumes and the overall gritty colour scheme of the entire movie. The King's Musketeers, historically consisting of nobility, seemed more like a group of mercenaries who had crawled to work through muddy ditches. And even the richer nobility seemed to prefer dark colours, which is just silly when you consider that bright colours and clean clothes were the main indicators of wealth at the time. Another downside relates to the relationships between the characters: overall, they were mostly taken for granted, assuming that viewers already knew that the three musketeers were close friends, so there was not much need to show it. There are no scenes showing the chemistry between the three musketeers to make them actually feel like friends. Similarly, d'Artagnan's relationship with Constance felt superficial at best - there was no apparent chemistry between the actors. There also seemed to be little left of the musketeers' honour: in an early fight with the cardinal's men, one of the musketeers commits a clear murder. On the positive side, the film showed some daring in slightly reinventing the story - and managed to do it with a fair bit of respect for history: the relationship between the king and his brother was as problematic as it should be, and the conflict between Catholics and Protestants received more visibility than in previous iterations, and it was even part of the plot. These elements lead to new plot twists and elements, but do not (IMHO) take it too far from the original (like some other recent film versions did). Of course, there were some ill-judged costume bits: temple frame spectacles on one character stood out (as they appeared only c. 150 years later), as well as the umbrella to hold off rain. This first part of the two-part film certainly loses to Lester's films from the 1970s, but it's still a somewhat enjoyable ""dark"" version of the adventure. I'm teetering between 3/5 and 3.5/5, but - for the moment - I'll let it lie at 3/5 (6/10)."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Production values without producing value,"Sure this movie gathers a lot of talent across all departments... except where it matters in the first place: screenwriting and directing. This Alexandre Dumas adaptation just aims to pack a lot of all-out action that looks more like a costumed digest of last decades' super hero fights. Instead of building up the mousquetaire characters and team spirit we have 4 loose swords competing for screen time and waiting for their cue to mouth one-liners. The other creative choices are defensible and a chunk of passable acting can certainly be traced down to bad direction. I am convinced nobody in the industry will overvalue the achievement of daddies boys (producer and director) so wildly missing the mark, but it is always puzzling to see a part of the audience just gobbling up fine images as a fine movie."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Interesting take on an old story,Amazing sets. I take it that they shot at actual locations. However some stuff kept bugging me. How come the musketeers look so dirty. It's a of they never cleaned themselves. And their clothes... somehow I don't think that they will wear like that when they are presented to the king. Just seemed that Richard Lester version was more accurate and managed to capture the essence of the story with the humor to carry the story along. The story was a bit weak and unnecessarily convoluted. I think the sub plot regarding Athos was an unnecessary diversion. Just added some level of confusion by throwing the conflict of the protestants and catholics into the mix. And This story depends a lot on the interaction between the newest member of the musketeers and the others. Which somehow didn't seem to be very well fleshed out. Lester's version showed a lot of camaraderie through interacting with each other. This show stretched their relationship. However I loved their interpretation of the period. Eva Greene as usual was transcendent. She was a sight for sore eyes.
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Bloody Brilliant,"A high-octane remake adapted from ""The Three Musketeers"" novel by Alexandre Dumas, ""D'Artagnan"" focused on the lead character of the book and took me once more into his heart-wrenchingly outrageous adventure. I remember reading the book when I was in school and later enjoying the unforgettable 2002 movie ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" thinking it would be years before someone, anyone, could adapt another Alexandre Dumas book as good as that one did. However the 2011 ""Three Musketeers"" movie was a disaster in storytelling. It was overly commercial and barely focused on the turmoil and tyranny of that particular timeline in French history. After all, the Musketeer books (plural) unravelled during the reigns of Louis XIII and XIV. Based on the historically real Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan, the dramatized novel is set between 1625 and 1628 and follows D'Artagnan as he goes to Paris in the hopes of becoming one of the King's legendary musketeers. 2023's ""The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan"" soon proved to be an exemplary adaptation, one that did the novel justice while also delivering on the outstanding French filmmaking I have come to admire over the years. The balanced plotline was *chef's kiss* and all the performances were stellar. Special shout-out to Eva Green (as Milady), Romain Duris (as Aramis), Pio Marmaï (as Porthos), Vincent Cassel (as Athos), Louis Garrel (as King Louis XIII), Lyna Khoudri (as Constance Bonacieux), Vicky Krieps (as Queen Anne d'Autriche), and François Civil (as D'Artagnan himself). The movie was set at a time when the English and French were at odds, and the great chasm between Catholics and Protestants was growing wider. Watching the movie in its original French - with subtitles in English, bien sur - made the words from each character feel intense and credible. I loved how they didn't dumb it down, but encouraged interpretation and set each scene so the viewer would connect the dots of intrigue. Political coups, religious scandals, and grand power struggles played out in earnest with deception and betrayal being the name of the game. Each scene felt masterfully crafted, almost like a biopic. This was what surprised me most. They took a wholly fictional novel and made it seem like its events were an all-too-real part of French history. Perhaps Dumas' vision when he wrote the book delved a little too deeply into the life of his Muse, Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan? Beautifully balanced cultural, romantic, chivalrous, and criminal tropes unravelled like fine silk on screen. Once I started watching ""The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan"", I couldn't stop until the final bell tolled. That cliffhanger ending and mid-credits scene were plot-twists to beat most plot-twists. The sequel better get here fast."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Poorly,"When a product is named as ... then you expect to see something similar to that name. If it is a car, then you will see the car, not the iron, as the manufacturer saw it, but the car. If it is ""The Three Musketeers. D'Artagnan"", then it is expected that it should be a film based on Dumas's book, and not a fictional story that stole the famous name. It is a great pity that the French have not read the book. Perhaps the film should have been called something else, so as not to mislead the audience, maybe ""D'Artagwoof"". All the names and events in the movie coincidentally coincide with the book and have nothing to do with it."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan,"Young, headstrong D'Artgnan leaves his rural roots and heads to Paris to become a musketeer. Attacked and left for dead, he recovers and in looking for those that attacked him falls foul of 3 musketeers Porthos, Aramis and Athos, who all challenge him to a duel for his insolence. However, instead he helps them in a fight of their own and becomes their firm friend, falls in love and becomes embroiled in an adventure to stop the evil Cardinal Richelieu growing his power base at court, starting with a betrayal of the queen. Given that the story is French, it is a bit strange that there hasn't been a French version for over 60 years, but enjoyably this has put that right. We are rather used to our Three Musketeer stories being rather light hearted pieces of derring do and usually bordering on straight comedy eg the glorious Richard Lester versions from the seventies. This version - part 2 is to follow - is far more serious and rather more determined to stay loyal to the book and its tone. It is noticeably more serious and darker than previous adaptations, albeit flecked with bits of humour, but this shouldn't put you off. There is of course a strong story here which here has yielded many exciting and well staged set pieces set amongst some glorious French backdrops. Enjoyably, but more serious than usual piece of swashbuckling."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),"Dark, gritty and Politically correct","I've watched every tv show or movie ever made about the Musketeers, and this is the first one I didn't finish. My all time favorite is the BBC series of 2013. I even enjoy the Charlie Sheen Disney movie, and there's a special place in my heart for DiCaprio in the Iron Mask (Jeremy Irons is the best Aramis ever) I prefer my Musketeers lighter, funnier and more adventure oriented than drama like. This new adaptation is rather gritty and dirty. No doubt that the 1600's were not sterilized, but this movie is more like early middle ages than romantic France. Also, maybe the populace lived in dirt and mud, but the King and his guard didn't. The casting of the Musketeers was also rather odd, these guys don't look the part at all, they just seem like regular folk, no charisma or presence. Milady the Winter and Treville are on point. Funny they wanted to preserve or recreate the dirt and grit of war engulfed France of the 1600's but they had to add the 2023 touch to it by making Porthos Bi. Filmmakers, respect the source material. Period."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),Bland and Boring,"The type of film someone who sees one every 5 months will say was pretty good and then forget about in an hour. Most of this isn't even what I'd consider bad per say, but all of it is executed in an exceedingly dull manner, except I guess the fight scenes which are presented in long shots, but even those suffer from obnoxious handheld: they do this weird thing where the camera moves in synchronization with the blades, which I presume is supposed to accentuate each move, but ends up completely muddling the visibility. So this ends up feeling like one of those TV productions with a half decent budget supporting it: it clearly isn't cheap but it does look the part. A complete bore of a visual palette - either orange-brown or the most flat looking blue you've ever seen - and nothing cinematographically of note. Conversations are shot / reverse shot with shallow focus (you know the kind) and a lot of scenes were clearly shot with the intention of getting a ton of coverage and hoping to get something out of it in the edit. I usually don't delve into the audio part of things, but I just want to mention that this unapologetically copy-pasted Hans Zimmer's Batman theme (it's literally the ""can I copy your homework"" meme) and for some reason used a Wilhelm scream on a bird?? If someone put it there as a joke in secret, I applaud you for creating the best moment in this film. The bar for that is as low as can be, though. Talking about a film like this, as much as my review here may prove otherwise, is difficult as it falls in the most boring category: utterly mediocre. The fact that this dares end on a cliffhanger is simply hilarious."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),The Fourth Musketeer!,"The story revolves around D'Artagnan who joins the Musketeers of the Guard and shows enough bravery when he clashes with the three musketeers - Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who take him under their wing. When Athos is falsely accused of murder, the other trio ensure to save Athos and time, while unraveling the larger conspiracy to harm the King and the Queen as well as instigating wide unrest planned by the baddie Milady and others. How D'Artagnan and three musketeers become a big hurdle to Milady and will they be able to save their King on time forms rest of the story, building up for a sequel. Straight up, this was definitely a good watch and even if the action set pieces mostly with the sword didn't stand out but the story as well as the characters instantly connects. To simply put, the production is top notch. Be with the setting and the costumes, the era is set solidly and the director wastes no time in kickstarting with the action right from the introduction scene of D'Artagnan. It kept throwing enough entertaining scenes throughout, made memorable by the actor especially the multiple duel scene with the trio or even the flirting between the main lead and Constance. It definitely was an easy watch and to keep more of Eva Green to the sequel alone is worth waiting for it."
The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan (2023),First part of the definitive adaptation of Dumas's work,"Although The Three Musketeers already has too many adaptations, surprisingly this French production offers something that, unlike previous adaptations, sticks quite closely to the novel in many aspects. It is an excellent film in many technical aspects with a wonderful production. It has a good cast and the script offers a much more detailed plot of The Three Musketeers. Athos accused of a crime he did not commit, the hidden romance between Buckingham and Anne, the Protestants, historical elements of the conflict between France and England and a clue about Milady's past are details that greatly help the dynamics of the plot. It is a classic action and adventure story very well executed and adapted to current times. Like the first adaptations, this film only narrates half of the novel and does so in a spectacular way. Les Trois Mousquetaires: D'Artagnan is perhaps the definitive adaptation of Dumas' work and leaves a very good impression with desire to see the rest of the story in the second part. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10."
Amsterdam (2022),Fine,"Decent watch This is definitely a one and done movie I don't see myself revisiting this one again. The movie is centred around 3 friends, a doctor, a lawyer and a woman who was a paramedic. Things take a turn when a client who is seeking the truth about her fathers murder is murdered and the two boys get the blame, they must clear their names, falling down a rabbit hole in the process. Will they free their names and uncover the truth of the murders? The movie is decent, the cast is stellar and the acting is great, not too many twists and the ones that happened were tame enough. The visuals were good and the music was okay, it felt a little too long, could have been 2 hrs. Overall okay, 6/10."
Amsterdam (2022),Quite possibly my film of the year,"Strange that on the 30th December I watch a film I had not heard of before
and that I am trying hard to think of a better film this year! Essentially the story of three friends, Christian Bale (Oscar worthy IMO), Margot Robbie who shows yet more depth to her acting and John David Washington who does a Stella job as the last of the trio of central characters who meet up during WWI and then the film unfolds. I mention them as the central characters versus the main protagonists as they are supported by no less than Taylor Swift, Robert De Nero, Zoe Saldana, Robbie Malek, Mike Myers and more. At the end I was left thinking I have seen a beautifully filmed, exceptionally well acted, well told story (which was apparently mostly true). Sure it is not going to be for everyone but if you are a fan of cinema, of wonderful acting, of a good plot, put aside a couple of hours and try this film and bask in Christian Bale being Columbo (deliberate or not)"
Amsterdam (2022),"It's incredulous who gets the funding... really a 1 out of 10, but isn't unpleasant in the background","Having come through, and well and truly left 'The Second Golden Age of Television' behind, it's still completely baffling how wish washy lame and pretty much plotless films and tv series are now getting all the funding. While this pointless film, with an all star cast and what seems like a very generous budget, doesn't grate upon one like the dismal failures of, say Fargo Season Four, it's pretty much in the same category... which would be akin to 1980's supermarket shelf romantic fiction paperback novels. There's literally nothing original, interesting or even vaguely suspense driven about it. It has a gentle tone about it, which prevents it from infusing an infuriating feeling of wasting one's time, but it is 99% exactly like 1990s pop-jazz elevator music. But it is aggravating, because there is obviously even talent and money involved for it to be really good. Who is writing this crap!? It reeks of nepotism and young-Millenial-meets Gen-z's elites who seem Yo have zero grit/absolutely no first hand life experience amd are completely unwilling to venture out of the ever closing-in-walls of what's 'socially acceptable'. The blame for this utter waste of money and time most likely falls on every executive and hands on producers involved, but not off the hook are the writers and directors, and even actors who choose to be involved. But essentially, the blame is on the financial backers, be gigantic corporations like Amazon, or a mix of highly propaganda oriented media companies. Sadly, the result is the same - utterly boring story telling. Let's just hope that this dark age of fiction media story telling doesn't last too much longer. Sigh."
Amsterdam (2022),Badly wanted to love this film but ...,"Loved the cast, the costumes and the ambition but something wasn't quite working for me. The characterisations bordered on the surreal and the sequence of events was hard to follow. I also struggled to place exactly when some of the 'between the wars' scenes were being set However, the make up used to represent the horrors of the Great War was brilliantly done (right down to the glass eye of the main protagonist played by Christian Bale) and the artworks done by Margot Robbie as Valerie Voze had a period authenticity. All things considered, I'm glad to have seen it. Elements of the film will stick with me and i will definitely discuss it with film fanatic friends."
Amsterdam (2022),Beautiful!,"I did not check rating of this movie before watching it. Was hugely surprised to find this is so underrated and am compelled to write a review myself. It is hard to categorize this movie into a genre. That could perhaps explain the underwhelming response. It seems to be a combination of art, comedy, suspense and love. I personally found aesthetics of this movie very beautiful. Performances are top class. As the movie mentions in the beginning, a lot of events in the movie actually did happen. This will not get you an adrenaline rush or moments of shock and awe. But for those who appreciate a bit of abstraction, artistry, free sprit and wild imagination combined with feel good moments, this is worth a watch."
Amsterdam (2022),"Loved it, need to watch again!","I started playing this movie not knowing what to expect, but knew it wasn't a comedy (yet I still got some good laughs), knowing it wasn't exciting adventure, crazy action, or sci-fi, all of which I love, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself attached to the story from the beginning, with lots of questions yes, which only added to the intrigue. Acting was great, so many big names, and good to see it covering important historical events. Seems like most negative reviews are either politically triggered, or by people who just can't keep up with a story and should stick to cartoons."
Amsterdam (2022),Terrific acting and craftsmanship can't help a movie that actively works to minimize its own substance,"The all-star cast rivals the ever-growing ensembles of Wes Anderson, and all involved give terrific performances full of spirit and personality. Filmmaker David O. Russell has made some noteworthy, well regarded films. Everyone behind the scenes turned in outstanding work across the board: sharp costume design, impeccable hair and makeup, crisp cinematography and editing, excellent stunts and effects, rich art direction, fine props, and so on and so on. The dialogue is witty, the characters are weird, the scene writing is wacky, and the story is, in turn, well-written, wild, wise, and/or worldly. And unfortunately, none of it impresses nearly as much as it's supposed to. 'Amsterdam' is very well made, there are some cutting ideas in the plot, and this even earns some laughs, but far more than not these 134 minutes come off as little more than a lot of hot air. From the moment it begins there's an overwhelming sense of falseness to the proceedings; this sense will not change, and it will come to pervade most every facet of the production. Every time one of the many, many big-name stars comes into a scene, and especially when they appear for the first time, they are framed, or the camera zooms in on them, in a manner that's meant to pointlessly accentuate their celebrity (e.g., ""Hey! Look who it is!""). Under Russell's guidance the cinematography is also, generally, often tawdrily grandiose, such as when the camera sweeps up from a low angle to look at Margot Robbie - not because the moment is dramatic, but specifically just because the inclusion is meant to wow us. For as unquestionably superb as the acting is, and for all the cleverness of the writing, far too much of that cleverness, and the actors' animated portrayals, come off in context as empty quirkiness and boisterousness for its own sake (e.g., ""Hey! Look how silly this is!""). It also takes the better part of one hour for the picture to feel like it's finding its feet, yet at the same time, the narrative and scene writing result in plot development that's a tad sideways, caring about that Gee Golly quirkiness as much as the story on hand. Even the production values, meeting the highest standards of live-action cinema in the 2020s, are actually kind of a problem; the utmost vividness of the image quality, and of every little detail, is a little too perfect. Speaking of ""a little too perfect,"" the even tone and level-headed verbiage of Christian Bale's narration serves to flatten the vibrancy the feature should carry; consider a preteen child telling a scary story with the undeveloped, matter-of-fact, Just So storytelling sensibility of ""This happened. And then this happened. Next, this happened."" Much of the plot draws from notions that are all too real - the collusion of capitalist interests, the wealthy and powerful, and those with significant ties in society or government and/or the military; conspiracies to dominate, subjugate, oppress, and install fascist leaders; manipulation, gaslighting, propaganda, and the weaponization of medicine - and urgent, admirable themes of diversity, acceptance of minorities and the marginalized, justice, equality, the pursuit of truth, actively fighting authoritarians, and more. All of this was relevant to the period in question, and remains despairingly, desperately relevant in 2023. Yet too much else about 'Amsterdam' either countermands that substance, or treats it too lightly, or distracts from it: that Gee Golly quirkiness, the most raucous sequences, the utmost perfection of most elements; the most whimsical aspects of the art direction, the exceptional performances that under Russell's direction threaten to become their own story rather than to serve the one being told, the prevailing light tenor; the pointed repetition of key words or phrases (""Amsterdam,"" ""Committee of Five"") like they were the Word of the Day in an episode of 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse'; and more. Everything looks and sounds great in and of itself. I'm a big fan of many of the cast members, and from one to the next I don't know whose performance is stronger. Between Russell's writing and direction, however, the impression that 'Amsterdam' makes is of a movie that wants to emphasize how smart it is, and how well made it is, and how many stars it has, and just how ridiculous its most ridiculous parts are - rather than how important, meaningful, and worthy the narrative is. This title is so self-important that it wants to point to all its ""Gee whiz!"" factors as its attractants and its strength rather than the earnest substance it has to offer, or the earnest hard work that everyone put into it. We know that Russell can be a great filmmaker. While I haven't watched it in some time, I fell in love with 'I heart Huckabees' from the first time I saw it. Sadly, despite all that it serves up and all that it could and should have been, this 2022 flick just doesn't make the grade, and I think that comes back entirely to Russell. The cast and crew deserved a better film; this should have been that better film. I don't abjectly dislike it, but it feels like no more than half of a whole, and the half that's missing includes the heart and integrity. I'm glad for those who appreciate 'Amsterdam' more than I do, but as far as I'm concerned it's no wonder that this came and went last year with so little fanfare. Better luck next time, everyone."
Amsterdam (2022),I really wanted to like it but...,"It's an interesting idea for a story, about a fascinating time in our history, starring some truly stellar actors. I wanted to love it, but it left me completely cold. Line deliveries were stilted, strange, and downright unnatural at times. Dialogue was dull, bizarre, or repetitious throughout. Very little chemistry between characters, and the comedy never landed for me. It often felt like characters were talking at each other, instead of to each other. The editing was choppy, the cinematography uninspired or distracting in turns. It's got a good message, and some OK story ideas, but they are ham-handedly delivered and often completely jumbled. The costumes were fine, and my spouse enjoyed it, so I guess it has that going for it."
Amsterdam (2022),"Very good casting, interesting story telling","Although the scenario was not the hit, was very straight forward without much twists, the cast and rhe way, how the story was told, deserved the 8 stars. The bird watching men, Valerie's curios artwork and the city of Amsterdam, that you only see in 1-2 scenes, made an aura of alienation effect (Verfremdungseffekt of Bertold Brecht) that made the story more interesting for me. The movie was indeed a little too long, and maybe the flashback parts could be shortened. The final message about the love, and the good in the human beings were told in a very poetic and nice way with some details that only the very careful watchers might catch (fish soup :) )"
Amsterdam (2022),I love this movie,"Amsterdam is a fabulous movie. Bale plays Peter Falk, and does so amusingly. The chemistry between Bale, Margot Robbie, and John David Washington is off the charts. DeNiro and Mike Myers are at their best too, as is everyone in the brilliant cast. The screenplay is the best of Russell's career. The movie looks back at the Nazis and the ultra-rich businessmen who tried to change history for the worse in the 1930s. It looks forward to the very same kinds of people who have risen again in the 2020s. The underlying theme is the struggle to save democracy. At the same time the film is frequently hilarious. It's romantic and beautiful too, and toward the end suspenseful. Try to imagine a mixture of Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and Alfred Hitchcock. Amsterdam was a financial flop when it appeared, perhaps because it appeared at an early post-pandemic moment when reviewers and audiences shied away from anything even remotely challenging. But Amsterdam is one of the great films of this century. It gives great pleasure and deserves to be beloved."
Whiplash (2014),The most intense thriller that's not technically a thriller.,"I wanted to kick back and relax tonight by watching three Damien Chazelle films back to back, because in my mind, they form a loose trilogy: Whiplash, La La Land, and Babylon. They all deal with the pursuit of making great art or achieving greatness, and how that clashes with various other things most people place importance on, to summarise the three as broadly as possible. I somehow forgot how stressful the first of these movies was, making it a difficult film to relax to. Even watching Whiplash for what I think is my fourth time does nothing to make it less stressful. Even Uncut Gems, which I've seen a few times now, has gotten a bit less intense with every rewatch. But Whiplash still makes me feel borderline light-headed for much of its runtime, and for that I really respect it. I also love how I still don't know entirely what I think of that excellent ending. The core conflict of the film is one I still think about often, and Whiplash not coming down hard one way or the other is the smartest things it does, at least thematically. Chazelle's later films are visually stronger and bolder, but Whiplash is just so wonderfully tight and free of even a second of filler. It's still a good-looking movie, but I feel like most of its visual flair comes from the editing, which is phenomenal, and heightens the intensity of the music, performances, and writing immensely. If Whiplash isn't a perfect movie, then it's so close it might well be. I love it immensely, even though it makes me nauseous."
Whiplash (2014),The truth lies somewhere in between,"The one thing that makes reaching a conclusion about this movie the hardest, is the fact that though Fletcher undeniably mentally and (partly) even physically maltreats his students, he does have a point in terms of what it takes to achieve ones dreams. His messages might be particularly triggering for people constantly chasing highs, with lack of dedication and determination to ""finish"" a goal. The ability to persevere through hard work, to sacrifice what needs to be sacrificed and to withstand self-doubt has become especially detrimental at times of instant gratification. What is it that leads someone to greatness, to near perfection? Would we all maybe profit from internalising some version of Fletcher whenever we set out to accomplish something? I am confident that most viewers feel the same way I felt about Fletcher: It's a hate/love relationship. And that's clearly what Andrew ends up feeling for his abusive mentor. Damien Chazelle has managed to perfectly capture every imaginable station a dreamer's emotional rollercoaster consists of: the suffering, the arrogance, the self-doubt, the overconfidence, the humbling, the pushing beyond ones limits, the giving up, the comeback. It's a truly powerful plot that explores the depths of human psychology while contrasting them to the inclination towards seeking shelter and comfort in the conventional. Particularly in the beginning one can see how Andrew struggles with himself: on the one hand he finds comfort in the quiet and conventional life he has with his family; people society wouldn't regard as valuable. Particularly not the type of society Andrew strives to be a part of. He lights up while talking to his date Nicole about the fact that he still enjoys watching movies with his dad. It's the child that comes out only to be annihilated by the later Andrew that chooses to be one of the greats of his century. The ending of the movie, however, leaves one with a few existential questions: You hear about Fletcher's previous student that commits suicide due to the pressure he no longer can withstand. A name of irrelevance to most, shattered before it ever shone. All the hard work gone with him in his grave. You see Nicole who has moved on with her life and found someone without a superiority complex, who probably defines success in a very different way to Andrew. And ultimately, it leads you to ask this: Who of all will - at the end of it all - be happiest? Perhaps the ultimate questions are these: 1) How much are you willing to sacrifice for a dream? But then inversely:
2) How much is that dream worth your sacrifices?"
Whiplash (2014),Crazy !,"I've been meaning to see it for so long, but I finally took the plunge and haven't looked back! A great on-screen partnership with Miles Teller, who is good in the role, but let's not talk about J. K Simmons who is just excellent in the tyrannical role of the professor. I loved this film because it's a world I didn't know, and it's interesting to see what a tough world it is, with huge competition... you can quickly see from Andrew Neyman's character that to become the best, you have to train hard, which is a great lesson in perseverance on his part. The little extras in this film are the intense scenes of confrontation, and the famous scene at the end where we see Andrew get the upper hand! Go ahead and watch this crazy film!"
Whiplash (2014),What should be the path of a man to become great?,"Have you ever wondered what a person's path should be to become great? Talent, hard work, a nudge from the outside? What should be the motivation to practice the same skill for hours, days, weeks, years in hopes of one day becoming the best? Honestly, I don't have answers to these questions. The very realization that I would have to practice the same thing on a regular basis over a long period of time throws me off. Constancy is clearly not my strong suit. Today I'm doing one thing, and tomorrow I'm burned out and doing something completely new. It's hard to master one skill perfectly under those circumstances, but you can try a lot of things. Maybe this is MY way - to try the world in all its diversity! However, Andrew Newman knows exactly what he wants - he wants to become the best drummer and is ready to wipe his hands in blood to realize his dream. One day his playing is noticed by the conductor of the best student orchestra in the country and he is invited to join the troupe. As stereotypical as geniuses are often portrayed in movies, Damien Chazelle's film portrays the conductor himself as stereotypical - overbearing, ruthless, manipulative, but a true creator and builder. Are you ready to endure anger, rage and emotional swings from a mentor who wants to awaken the great musician in you? After the tragic death of one of the conductor's previous students, an investigation begins into the teaching methods of Terence Fletcher (that's the conductor's name). At some point Andrew too breaks under the teacher's onslaught and it seems that the path to his dream is complete. So Andrew also decides to testify against his idol, after which the conductor is suspended from running the orchestra. The story could have ended there, if not for the love of music. Some time later Terence invites Andrew to play the drum part at one of the festivals, which is important for the future of musicians - the jury members can give a ticket to life or close all roads to the professional world. Either out of a desire for revenge or intentionally manipulating Andrew's feelings once again, the conductor sets the drummer up and plays a part for which the drummer was unprepared, resulting in Andrew's public embarrassment. But instead of breaking down again, he takes the next beat into his own hands and already begins to lead the entire orchestra. In the end, Andrew and the conductor become so obsessed with the music and themselves that they produce something ""beyond human capabilities,"" as Movie Search says about it. Without irony, the final scene was indeed very musical and inspired. Nevertheless, I have mixed impressions about this movie. Some bitter aftertaste because of the behavior of the main character and his mentor. Probably because such teaching methods are just not for me. But maybe that's why I won't become great, who knows. On the other hand, the drum parts with absolutely frantic rhythm and the general atmosphere of the movie are mesmerizing and keep you in suspense throughout the whole picture. So, I think it's worth watching, to at least answer for yourself the question about your limits on the way to perfection. 8 out of 10."
Whiplash (2014),Motivation,"Wow, just wow. I'm sitting here, still catching my breath after watching ""Whiplash,"" and I can't help but feel like I've just been through an emotional whirlwind. Damien Chazelle's masterpiece is unlike anything I've seen before, a heart-pounding symphony of ambition and obsession that left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. First off, let's talk about Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman. I was completely blown away by his performance. The guy not only nailed the intense drumming sequences (seriously, my heart was racing during those scenes), but he also brought such depth to his character. You could feel Andrew's burning desire for greatness, and as the story unfolded, I found myself both rooting for him and fearing for his sanity. And J. K. Simmons as Terence Fletcher-wow, just wow. I can't imagine anyone else in that role. Simmons was a force of nature, this relentless, almost terrifying presence as the music instructor. Fletcher's teaching methods were borderline insane, but Simmons played him with such nuance that I found myself questioning whether his intensity was a necessary evil or just straight-up abuse of power. No wonder he bagged the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The whole atmosphere of the film was just electric. The drumming, the jazz, the tension-it all blended together in this perfect storm of emotions. The cinematography and the score elevated every moment, making even the smallest practice session feel like a life-or-death situation. The way Chazelle captured the competitive world of music conservatories was nothing short of genius. But it's not just about the music; it's about the human cost of chasing perfection. The film had me contemplating the lengths one should go to achieve greatness. Is it worth sacrificing everything? The relationships, the health, the sanity? ""Whiplash"" doesn't shy away from these tough questions, and it left me pondering the blurred lines between motivation and abuse, success and obsession. The dialogue was razor-sharp. I mean, I could quote lines from this movie all day. Each word felt like a punch, driving home the film's themes about the relentless pursuit of one's dreams. And the editing-oh, don't get me started. The tight shots during drumming sequences, the rapid editing during confrontations, it all added to the intensity. I was literally on the edge of my seat, hanging on every beat. In the end, ""Whiplash"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It celebrates the pursuit of excellence while forcing you to confront the price of that pursuit. I'm still processing everything, but one thing's for sure: ""Whiplash"" has left an indelible mark on me. It's a cinematic gem that will stay with me for a long, long time. If you haven't seen it, buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride."
Whiplash (2014),A good way to get killed...,"JK Simmons would NEVER get away with physically, verbally and mentally assaulting students. Furthermore, the implication that a musician student would not react and stick up for themselves by handing Simmons his ass is a tired story. Everyone has a breaking point, everyone. A man like this would have been killed or seriously mamed by a student, a students loved ones, or the students friends etc. The message that being pushed to the brink is the only way to strive for ""perfection"" is a tired story and never well ending. The story itself is good (for a movie) it's disturbing and even unrealistic, but it's good for entertainment."
Whiplash (2014),Filled with intense and great emotion,"The film Whiplash is a great movie about a young college student named Andrew, played by Miles teller, trying to improve his skills and make a career out of his drumming talents. When Andrew is chosen by Terence Flecter, played by J. K Simmons, to participate in his band, Andrew must overcome the intense and grueling training to improve his talents and make a career for himself. Whiplash had great emotions that were really intense. The acting was fantastic and had me shook. Both Miles Teller and J. K Simmons did a fantastic job in playing their characters and drawing out their emotions. Whiplash is a beautiful movie that not only captivates the beauty of music, but also the difficulty and demand needed to play music professionally."
Whiplash (2014),Follow perfection. Success follows you,"It is almost Damien Chazelle's first film, and achieving such a great success in his first film is not the feat of every brave man. Such films made in the field of music have always managed to attract my attention. This film has managed to be among the best in its genre. Damien Chazelle generally works in musical productions, and his film scripts are based on the story of a musician. He did not compromise on his line in this movie and perhaps did the best he could. Moreover, he was only 30 years old. It stars JK. Simmons and Miles Teller. When I watched the movie Birdman, I said that Edward Norton deserved and should have received the Oscar for best supporting actor, but after watching this movie, a name that could challenge Edward Norton in the supporting actor category caught my attention JK .Simmons, what the hell was that, even when the movie was over, I was still remembering the curses the man said, he showed a great acting and he almost lived it. I believe that Teller, who managed to cope with the role considering his age, will have even more opportunities after this film. The film has 5 Oscar nominations and . It's a movie that I believe everyone, whether they like the genre or not, should have it in their archives. Watch it and make others watch it. Quote from a wise person: Work not for wealth, but for success. Follow perfection. Success follows you."
Whiplash (2014),MODERN DAY MUSICAL MASTERPIECE,"What can i say. This is one of the best films I've seen in recent years, and that came as a suprise too. I was never a huge fan of drama, I was more of a action packed kinda guy, but this blew me away. First of all, the performances of both Miles Teller and and J. K Simmons were both absolutely incredible with miles Teller acting one of his, if not, his best performance to date. The characters where captivating, with fletcher stealing the show as one of the most terrifying villians in years. The story and cinematography where beautiful and captivating. And of course, you can't forget the music. If you're a fan of Jazz, you will love it, if your a fan of drums, you will love it, and if your not... You will be after watching this film. Also, the finale left me speechles. Even if you hate the whole film. You will love the finale."
Whiplash (2014),AH,"I watched this when I was a teenager, which was also around the time I started to become more interested in an artistic craft. This movie scared the s*** out of me. I felt so stessed the entire time. I felt so anxious the entire time. Why we make movies that make us feel this way I have no idea. But I'm glad we do! Despite the rush, or because of it, I loved this movie! If you've ever trained for an artistic field, this movie can sadly feel really accurate, which I think we should see more of. Art is so much fun, but there is also this aspect; blood, sweat, tears, and probably a teacher somewhere driving it."
Holiday Inn (1942),Trigger warning: Black face musical number,"I recently saw White Christmas and loved the dancing and music and thought I'd give this one a view and I could not get through it. The basis of the movie is a character in the movie created the ""Holiday Inn"" as a place people would visit during the holidays. They had a musical number celebrating President Lincoln that was horrific. I could not finish the movie. It's not cringy it's horrible. This was part of US history, as many of these ""classic"" movies are, but there is a point where these type of scenes should make you sick, not continue to go back year after year to watch because you enjoy the movie. There are other classics featuring Irving Berlin's music that can be watched without featuring this horrible part of history."
Holiday Inn (1942),Leaves me somewhat cold,"Finally saw this yesterday. I know it's considered a Christmas classic of sorts, but it lacks something. First of all, much of it has very little to do with Christmas. The idea is that the inn is open and gives shows on holidays, which means that Christmas is just one of many shown. Second.... something about Bing Crosby's awww shucks nice guy performance seems inauthentic to me, especially in light of what I know about him. The female leads annoy me. One dumps Fred Astaire's character the minute some guy waves dollars at her. Then she comes crawling back to him and expects him to forget that she dumped him. Hardly a sympathetic character. The other one can't seem to make up her mind what she cares about. Does she really love either man? For that matter, does either one love her? The best Crosby can muster for her is a perfunctory peck on the cheek, and both of them respond with an ""oh well, whatever"" when she bounces from one to the other. It seems like they're more interested in competing than in love. Fred's dancing is the redeeming feature, especially the firecracker dance. Him dancing while ""drunk"" was silly, though. The Lincoln song was awful for its racism, but it's in line with the attitudes of the period. The song White Christmas is the one truly memorable aspect."
Holiday Inn (1942),"Great diversion during WWII, great diversion for me today.","Not a Christmas movie. Just a film about holidays, including Christmas. Many people only watch it at Christmas time. It makes sense to me because Bing Crosby is the voice of Christmas. The romantic twist and turns happen so fast it will make your head spin. Astaire and Crosby characters always find themselves both competing for the same girl. Both the men and women in this movie are extremely fickle. ""You loose one girl, you find another. Thats life"" For this movie you don't want to worry about the plot and just enjoy the showcase of great music and dancing. Won an Oscar for Best Music, Original Song in 1943. The music is by Irving Berlin. Altho the chemistry between Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire and Marjorie Reynolds is excellent Marjorie is the real stand out star for me. She so well expresses her emotions through her facial expressions that you can't help but feel them too. The warnings for this movie included a blackface routine done for Lincoln's Birthday. In 1954 a very loose remake was made called ""White Christmas"" due to the huge popularity of the song. Paramount Originally thought that the hit number from ""Holiday Inn"" would be ""Be Careful, It's My Heart"" instead. Today ""White Christmas"" is the best-selling single worldwide."
Holiday Inn (1942),A must every Christmas,"Corny? Yes
Thin plot? Yes
Great music? Oh boy! Both Crosby and Astaire are terrific together. I particularly love Astaire in this because he plays against type as a cad. He's pretty sexy in this film. And Marjorie Reynolds was gorgeous and looked like she was having a ball. Walter Abel is good and Louise Beavers- as always- is adorable. The one thing that makes me wince is the ""Abraham"" number. Not just because of the blackface which is very outdated. But the worst part is Marjorie Reynolds line BEFORE she does the number. She claims she hates to put on blackface because ""I've been dreaming about how beautiful I would look tonight."" Cut to her entrance in the number. She enters wearing a blond wig made up like Buckwheats hair, wearing a pick a nanny outfit. If she had planned on looking beautiful in THAT outfit, she must be blind. Makes me wonder how they whipped up that blackface costume so quickly. Best part: seeing Astaire dance drunk or amongst fire crackers. And hearing ""White Christmas""."
Holiday Inn (1942),You should see this on Christmas Eve,"What a wonderful actress! I think the script for the scene where she first appears is very bland and boring, but it had a huge impact. I think it was the power of the actress. I was instantly captivated by the actress. The whole story is the same kind of stuff that you would see in many films, but it's very well written. I have never seen such a well done film with this kind of story. I can only say that I was overwhelmed by it. Although the performances of the actors are responsible for much of the charm of the film, the script is undoubtedly excellent. The actors, the actress, the script... I hope such a great movie will be talked about for a hundred years!"
Holiday Inn (1942),I'm Dreaming of a White Face Christmas,"Yes, despite traditional naming conventions, the Crosby song ""White Christmas"" is not from the film that shares its name, it comes from this film here, ""Holiday Inn"". And No, the 1954 movie, ""White Christmas"" is not a spinoff or sequel to this movie, it just features a lot of the same cast. ""Holiday Inn"" plays to the strengths of its starring cast. As they show off right away, Bing Crosby can sing, and Fred Astaire can dance. The story is a thinly veiled excuse to get these actors to do what they do best. The characters do have a clear motivation and personality, but the conflict feels very forced. If the characters were to sit down and have a 5-minute conversation this would all be taken care of. In a way, this film is similar to ""Meet me in St. Louis"", both have an all-time Christmas classic song, but both focus on various other holidays through the year. Although, strange that Holiday Inn completely avoids ""Halloween"". They have both George Washington and Abe Lincoln's birthday, but not Halloween? Also, Bing Crosby is kind of a jerk in this film. Then when he is called out for it, he throws himself a 5-month long pity party, sulking about how he feels wronged. But I digress, the film does exactly what it sets out for, it showcases Crosby's singing and Astaire's dancing. As an added bonus there is a little story to go along with it, the story even has a few good laughs to be found in it as well."
Holiday Inn (1942),What a wholesome and wonderful movie.,"If you want a feel good old movie to combat all the gross stuff on tv now a days, this is the perfect film. The choreography is beautiful, the sets amazing and the costumes are stunning. It truly is a perfect holiday movie. I mean just hearing Bing sing ""White Christmas"" is enough. It is truly a wonderful family film that everyone should watch. It just brings you back to a simpler and happier time in this great country. If you are a fan of musicals and Christmas then add this to your list. It will definitely be in my rotation forever. It's time to start just watching AMC and AMC only to find gems like this."
Holiday Inn (1942),You will recognize the songs and say oh that's where they came from.,"You are Cordially Invited to the Opening of ""Holiday Inn"" Bing Crosby sings, Fred Astaire dances, and Virginia Dale does most of the coordination and a lot of singing and dancing without that much credit. Later entered Marjorie Reynolds again overlooked. Be aware that Marjorie Reynolds' singing was dubbed by Martha Mears. Irving Berlin's Greatest musical score

Let's watch and see how it pans out. You may find yourself singing ""I'm dreaming of a white Christmas"" in the shower."
Holiday Inn (1942),Blackface ruined the movie,"I thought this movie was just ok. But after witnessing the blackface scene, it became horrible. It surprises me that some people rated this 10/10 but perhaps they watched a version without the offensive characters singing in blackface with blonde Wigs (I saw the colorized version). Or perhaps they aren't offended by blackface. If I would've been able to see the edited version of the film, I might've liked it, especially since the songs and dancing were good at the start of the movie. This movie should be banned from all platforms. Those sort of images shouldn't be released in this day and time. It's almost 2024 for goodness sake!"
Holiday Inn (1942),Surprise Racism is NOT the best kind of Racism,"I was not expecting this movie to completely shatter my sense of ethical morality. Normally, I consider myself to be someone that tries to understand that things of the past can't necessarily be held up to today's standards. The sociopolitical climate has changed and what was ok isn't what's ok now. I try... But good LORD this one broke me. Sure don't expect a movie called Holiday Inn to have an entire musical number about Lincoln with a couple dozen people in blackface and a few actual people of color praising it. The racism, the sexism, the... I just couldn't get passed it. For a film that I went into expecting wholesomeness and kindness to then be blindsided by that just... Nope nope nope."
La La Land (2016),Awesome,"I played the trumpet for a few years back in high school, and while I wasn't persistent or driven enough in playing that musical instrument to be a protagonist in a Damien Chazelle movie, I did get one piece of advice from an instructor I'll never forget. He likened playing a piece of music in front of an audience to making a chicken roll at a Subway or equivalent fast food joint. He said so long as the first bite and the last bite of a chicken roll tastes great, the customer will be satisfied, so put the fatty/skin chunks of chicken near the front and the end of the roll. The rest might be kind of dry or less juicy, but those parts of the sandwich are... I guess sandwiched between the good stuff, and the good stuff matters most (this anecdote is going somewhere, don't worry). So that's all to say that he said to focus on the opening part and the end part of a piece when playing in front of people, and the rest can - quite literally - be noise. La La Land is, of course, better than a merely good chicken sandwich. The tasty chicken chunks last longer than the first bite; the whole first half of the chicken roll is perfect. Then there are a few bites that remind me I'm eating something that's fast food; a bit simple and dry, yet still more than edible. But then there are ample skin parts saved for the end. The last few bites of the La La Land sandwich are somehow even better than that whole first half. Sorry for the non-vegan-friendly analogy/ramble, but La La Land hits the spot almost the whole way through. It's one I'd rank behind Whiplash and Babylon by a hair, but it's still fantastic. It's one fine cinematic sandwich that starts with a bang and still manages to save the best for last."
La La Land (2016),Gosling and Stone hitting the right note,"Directed by Damien Chazelle, is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. The film effortlessly blends romance, music, and dance, creating a nostalgic yet contemporary cinematic experience that captivates audiences from the opening scene. The film's strongest asset is undoubtedly the chemistry between the lead actors, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Their performances are both charming and authentic, making it easy for audiences to invest in the love story at the heart of La La Land. Gosling's portrayal of jazz pianist Sebastian is particularly noteworthy, showcasing his dedication to the role and his ability to convey a deep passion for his craft. The musical numbers are another highlight, with vibrant choreography and memorable tunes that linger in the mind long after the credits roll. The film's opening sequence, set on a Los Angeles freeway, is a dazzling spectacle that sets the tone for the visual feast that follows. Chazelle's direction, coupled with the masterful work of the cinematographer, captures the magic of the City of Angels, transforming it into a dreamlike backdrop for the characters' aspirations. However, La La Land is not without its flaws. One notable criticism lies in the pacing of the narrative. While the film successfully immerses the audience in the world of its protagonists, there are moments when the plot seems to meander, affecting the overall momentum. The dreamy atmosphere occasionally gives way to a slower rhythm, and some viewers may find certain scenes overly indulgent, contributing to a slightly bloated runtime. Additionally, despite the film's celebration of jazz music, some aficionados might argue that La La Land oversimplifies and romanticizes the genre, overlooking its complexities and rich history. Sebastian's purist attitude towards jazz, while integral to the story, may strike a discordant note for those who appreciate a more nuanced representation of the art form. In conclusion, La La Land is undeniably a cinematic gem, with its enchanting visuals, compelling performances, and infectious musicality. Despite its minor pacing issues and simplified portrayal of jazz, the film succeeds in delivering a heartfelt and nostalgic experience that resonates with audiences. It's a modern-day musical that pays homage to the classics, and even with a few sour notes, it manages to hit most of the right chords."
La La Land (2016),The Tragedy of Life,"La La Land is a truly special movie. To me, the meaning of the movie is that sometimes to achieve our dreams we have to sacrifice some things. Whilst it is a painful journey, it is a magical journey. Mia and Sebastian were both trying to achieve their dreams as they fell in love. In the end, they went their separate ways which allowed both of them to achieve their dreams. At the end of the movie, we get to see what their life would have looked like if everything went right for them and if they had stayed together. It was beautiful but just a fairytale. We see in this alternate ""reality"" that Mia goes to Paris to shoot her movie and Sebastian follows her. In my opinion, I don't think that Mia could have lived with herself knowing that Sebastian gave up his dream for her. The final scene between Mia and Sebastian said everything about their relationship. The smile and nod. They both still love each other very much and know that they needed to be with other people in order to realise their dreams. I throughly enjoyed La La Land. The music score is wonderful. The acting was phenomenal as was the directing. The title of the movie maybe La La Land but trust me there are so many life lessons to be learnt from this incredible movie."
La La Land (2016),I went and cleaned my bathroom I got so bored,"If you want to go to sleep, watch this movie. It's slow, it's ""Jazzy,"" the story sucks, the characters are stale even thought Gosling & Stone are fantastic in other movies they just couldn't save this movie from being bad, it's just so boring. I don't understand the rating others gave it because for me it's one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I watch on average 300-500 movies a year and finally gave this one a chance and I really wish I didn't because it was a waste of 2 hours ill never get back. Everyone has their own opinions so give it a shot but for me it was absolute torture to get through."
La La Land (2016),Best film I've ever seen,"For the last year I have been rating movies, I've seen and I have rated over 100 films. If I could I would give this film 11/10, I would do it. Unfortunately that isn't possible. This movie satisfyid me in every possible way. I sat and smiled over the romance scenes. I could close my eyes and enjoy the music. I cried in the end, as they smiled to each ether and spread apart. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone truely does an outstanding performance in this film. Especially Emma Stone surprised me with her dancing and singing scenes. Same can be said with Ryan Gosling. Just WOW. The story is so hearting and inspiring. Never give up on your dreams. Other films give the same message. But La La Land can't be compared to them. This movie is an astonishing piece of art. No more to be said there."
La La Land (2016),MásterPiece,"It's the best love story I ever seen, it's full of Drama, Music, and one of the best love story's of all time, this is mi favorite movie. It contains much of the best actors in all industry including Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who made a great job making this one of the best love story's with the dancing the music all the vibe together makes it so special. If I could watch this for the first time I would give a hundred dollars for that it is so special for me, it makes me feel like love it's still possible this days and includes one of my favourites music genders the jazz makes this so special. THE BEST LOVE MOVIE OF ALL TIME."
La La Land (2016),12.29.2023,"A modern version of Bergman's Joy? A modernist musical fantasy? Your precious Hollywood is back! The opening long shot does have quite a touch of classical theater musical pretension. But the weak plot shines through the long shot's infinite pairs of picture frames, and yes this plot is a total fluff piece that seems to try to salvage the spectacle with the closing ringing narrative but the poorly assigned plot crossed with the musical seems too much to swallow. If a lot of ink had been devoted to that musical element, I think it would have been a passable musical. But the director's plotting is really off-balance, and when the subject gazes into a mirror and objectifies himself, I was expecting something surreal, but instead he overstepped his bounds with such a compromised and conservative story. I love Emma Stone's work in long-take movies like Birdman, but this time the infinite extension of the camera beyond the frame doesn't tell any moving story, but rather a tired one. You can have fun, but... There's also no excuse for the fact that it seems like the director understands that cabaret formula and writes cabaret in long takes. It makes each song and dance a separate world, but interrupts the montage to make you feel sick and nauseous. The music becomes the only superhuman presence in this flick, able to transcend time and space, enter into fantasies, break the traditional language of cinema, and unfold surreally, but it all seems to be there to supplement all that modernist yellowness? Kill the pig with a bull's-eye? The structure is fragmented and clichéd."
La La Land (2016),Woah,"I wasn't expecting that at all. I've avoided this movie for as long as I could, because I thought it was a musical. We even watched the flamboyant, over the top opening scene months ago and quit. Upon revisiting it and viewing the subsequent scenes, I was totally encapsulated. I've always been a fan of Gosling, who is strong in every role I've seen him in, but this is by far Emma Stone's best role. The musical composition is absolutely beautiful, the pacing is perfect, and the writing is thoughtful and elegant. These two stars really shined in this movie, as there is not much of a supporting cast at all. I was a little bewildered by the events that occurred between the last two seasons, but anything can happen in 5 years. Beautifully tragic and unconventional twist ending that felt all too real and relatable. This was a totally unexpected home run, despite the high ratings. Brilliant."
La La Land (2016),Rewatched in live concert with Justin Hurwitz,"It was amazing to see a Maestro at work. The La La Land original score is beautiful. Its lyrics takes you on a subtle journey through the movie whilst its catchy melodies inspire hope, grief and an abundance of energy. There should be nothing more to say about La La Land at this point but I fear that isn't the case... La La Land is a musical drama rom com that follows two individuals pursuing their dreams and the inevitable trials and tribulations that ensues when trying to make it as an actress or follow ones passion for Jazz in Hollywood. The soundtrack accompanies outstanding cinematography and set designs that creates a stunning Los Angeles awash with beautiful colours, harking back to the golden age of cinema and theatre. La La Land is beautifully made and beautifully told. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are outstanding in their roles. There isn't a second that their performances aren't convincing and captivating and the simple plot will have you cycling through your emotions. This was the first time I've rewatched La La Land since its original theatrical release and I enjoyed it much more having already explored the key themes and of course having listened to the original score on several occasions."
La La Land (2016),A film to watch as a young adult,"First time I played this movie was back when it was released. I'm glad I didn't watch it back then. I was watching it with company and they thought that musicals are boring, that's why we turned it off. Years later, I finally watched it, understanding more about the making of a movie and I can say, this movie is great! I can feel the struggle of the characters, finding their own paths, chasing their dreams. I'm in a similar situation today, as a young adult, still looking which path to follow. It is a really touching and beautiful film, I'd totally recommend it! The beginning of the film might not be as catching at first, but after watching half an hour, the film becomes more and more beautiful."
Elvis (2022),I should have read the reviews...,"MAN what a let down this movie is! One reviewer hit the nail on the head. A more apt name for this is ""(Fake) Col Parker: portrayed horrifically by Tom Hanks"" The looks are wrong, the timeliness of music and history are wrong, the camera work was jarring and gave me a headache, Elvis was portrayed as a simp, and worst of all - I just didn't care. Of all of the historical aource material, there was absolutely no need to make up things. From the film I gathered that Elvis simply stole entire songs and wrote nothing, but hit fame only because he ""wiggled"" his pelvis on stage. Austin Butler did a fine job, Tom Hanks was woefully miscast."
Elvis (2022),I wish Tom Hanks was not in this film.,"This film would have been perfect if Tom Hanks had not been cast as Colonel Tom Parker. Really, the new America's Dad as the awful misusing ""talent Manager"". Christoph Waltz would have been a much better choice! Because of this casting decision, I cannot watch this film again without cringing. Austin Butler was amazing! He was Elvis reborn. Major applause to him. Olivia DeJong was impressive. But I cannot get over the miscasting of Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker. Tom Hanks is an American treasure...the new America's Dad. He is among my favorite actors. He should have never been in this film Baz Lurhmann."
Elvis (2022),American Grotesque,"This film is intended as a biography of Elvis Presley, but the film is really about the ""phenomenon"" of Elvis. Whether intentional or not, the lurid and often grotesque depiction of this man's life is closer to a culture's fascination with such topics as fame, sex, and such monstrous images as the opulent Graceland mansion. Elvis Aaron Presley and Jesse Garon Presley were twins born in a shack in East Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. But little Jesse died shortly after birth. Biographers such as Albert Goldman examine the strange force at work on Elvis whose life may have been haunted by the loss of his twin brother. But the focus of the film is really on the strange man known as Colonel Tom Parker, who is portrayed as the devil, tempting and corrupting his young charge Elvis. Obviously, some degree of research went into the history of the Colonel, but he became another feature of the grotesque in this film. The vocal style of Elvis is depicted as an act of plagiarism, with the young Elvis appropriating the African-American styles of jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues. The facts of his own beautiful voice, his ambition, and actual performing skills are muted in the film. Much credit belongs to Austin Butler for his attempt to flesh out the title character in a baroque film that primarily leaves the viewer with a sense of the American grotesque."
Elvis (2022),I got 3/4 through it and could take no more,"It was like they took a movie, an audio book, and a documentary, chopped them up, mixed them up, and pasted them back together in mostly chronological order. But each thing was by different people and didn't mesh quite right with the others. It felt like a messy dream, and maybe that's exactly what they were going for to make you feel like Elvis may have felt living it. But it's not enjoyable as a movie or as a story due to the format. They were trying to make it different and to modernize it, and to tell the story about Elvis while validating the black culture his music stemmed from. That part they did the best of anything. The bits of black culture they show is vibrant and energetic and inspirational. Definitely beats the white culture that's freaking out about some guy's pelvic jiggling. If that's how it really happened those white folk were pretty thirsty for a little sexiness. Normally I wouldn't say quite so much about a movie you maybe haven't seen yet, but I think going into it knowing all this would've made it better for me. I got 3/4 through it and I'm not going back to it, but I'm glad I watched as much as I did. Parts of it are interesting and though I don't like the movie overall, I also recommend trying it. It's the kind of movie that's really going to provoke love or hate. Elvis died before I was born, I only knew the basic stuff about him and I didn't go into it with much personal opinion/feeling about him. I like him a little more from seeing the movie. I read other reviews here that say the Elvis dancing wasn't quite right, so it piqued my interest to see him dancing. Much of Elvis dancing in the movie looked more like he was having a jiggling fit of some sort, with a violent pelvic thrust thrown in sometimes, than dancing. I liked how they meshed old and new music in the movie."
Elvis (2022),Way overhyped,"I was sooo excited when I saw the movie ""Elvis"" was playing on Netflix. I got my blanket, sat in my chair was ready for a good movie. I mean, Tom Hanks as a main character in amovie about Elvis , how could I be disappointed? From the moment it started I can't believe how disappointed I was. From the HORRIBLE acting, to the pieced together sequence. The total creeped out feeling I got from Tom Hanks character. For the actor who played Elvis, I didn't get any Elvis vibe from him at all! It's one of those movies where you have to watch to see if it gets any better..and it did not. Way overhyped. Disappointed."
Elvis (2022),Austin Butler WAS Elvis but Movie Pace Hampered It's Glory,"To start with, I am NOT rating this movie as Meandering because of Austin Butler's performance. Austin Butler was excellent as Elvis. Of course no one is going to really replicate Elvis Presley, Austin Butler did pretty dang close even if he was a little bit goofy looking. Austin Butler's acting was great, Olivia Dejonge was a worthy Priscilla but I'm not really sure they had much chemistry on the screen though. I didn't really get emotional when Priscilla left Elvis in the movie. Perhaps if they had been given more time together, or if the movie was entirely about Priscilla and Elvis, I would feel differently about these two. The main focus was Elvis Presley and his devil of a manager, played by Tom Hanks. What makes this movie a big disappointment Firstly was the rapid, dizzying story pace and the jerk between present day when Tom Parker lays dying, to the past. Left me with a bit of a headache, watching. Someone thought that the producer might have ADHD, perhaps that is what happened. Because this type of pace isn't normal and I hated it instantly. Also, I had no idea who Tom Parker was so to open the movie with Tom Parker was a little jarring. Would have been more practical if they opened it up with Elvis's death. Or funeral. Secondly, it's not often I agree with other critics but in the case of Tom Hanks' , the ridicule is completely justified. Tom Hanks' sounds like a fool with his abhorrent, fake German accent? That grated on my ears! And why did he even have to narrate the movie, when the audience is led to hate him throughout the movie? Why couldn't they have just told the story? I didn't think a narrator was needed. Especially not him! Seriously, in a movie about the King of Rock, Tom Parker's ugly voice was not needed. Thirdly, Elvis Presley deserved a slower, more respectful pacing in his own movie. About his own life. It felt like they were constantly trying to hurry you on to the next phase of his life and didn't even give you a chance to really empathize, and absorb the life and world of Elvis. You see way too much of Tom Parker, to the point where you want to tear him out of the film, because the movie shouldn't even be about him. It should be about Elvis. Then there's the ending itself. Just cutting off after Elvis awesomely fires Tom Parker and then to explain through scrolling the rest of history. After all of the drama of revealing what a con artist and what a Mephistopheles-like demon Tom Parker was; worming his way into Elvis Presley's life and leading him to absolute misery...
Why didn't the writers give us satisfaction of a scene of Tom Parker dying alone in the hospital? You tell such a heart-wrenching tale of all that happened Presley, it was a mistake that all we are left with at the end was just a couple history cards to read. I have seen better biopics from Hollywood. This is not one of them. I expected a lot more of the story of Elvis Presley. Johnny Cash and June Carter got a pretty good Hollywood movie, Elvis Presley deserved better than this. Guess I would say to the fans of the King, watch it for free and don't be surprised if you end up disappointed. And for heaven's sakes don't buy it!"
Elvis (2022),Can't decide if it's genius or dreck,"Anyone who is familiar with Baz Luhrmann will not be surprised to find that this movie is visually arresting. The short cuts, the surrealistic feel, lots going on at once, fast pans from one thing to the next, the split screens, the non-linearity , etc, --- I believe these are all Luhrmann hallmarks. I appreciate the effort it took to make such a glitzy, lush display. The film has a high production value. Obviously Luhrmann had a huge budget for this project and spared no expense. Butler did an outstanding job in the title role, as did the young man who played the pre-teen Elvis. It is hard for me to be objective about Tom Hanks' performance, because I had read too many scathing reviews of it. If anyone else had played the role of Colonel Parker, I don't think his reviews would have been nearly as bad. It's just hard to watch an iconic talent play a caricature. Plus the character was creepy in all those grotesque circus and carny scenes, and his prosthetics were distracting. The soundtrack had a lot of overlays of one bit of music over another; a stylistic choice which did not satisfy me. You will guess my age when I tell you that I owned a pink plastic Elvis Presley wallet when I was a little girl. So maybe I was not this film's intended audience. It has many good points, though; and I recommend seeing it if for no other reason than to see what all the fuss was about."
Elvis (2022),Sad representation of an amazing artist,"First of all Tom Hanks gives an awful performance and made it a joke of a film. Austin did a pretty decent job representing Elvis. However, the film gave off a cartoon-ish feel and not to mention it was so chopped up and made it hard to follow at times and intrest was lost at times because of it. This is not the tribute I wished it had been to such an incredible artist. There needs to be a true movie made about Elvis that doesn't have Persilla's biased views on him and his life. Yes, she played a huge role in his life but her view isn't always the greatest! Maybe a movie with his band mates view on him might be more entertaining? Also, a movie based on Elvis and his music doesn't need rap music added in to it. Focus on his music and the music that influenced HIM!"
Elvis (2022),"""Elvis"" Review","The cinematic rendition of Elvis, featuring Austin Butler in the titular role, undeniably stands out as an exemplary piece of artistry. Butler's portrayal of Elvis is nothing short of masterful, capturing the essence of the icon with nuanced precision. The film's brilliance extends beyond individual performances; its impeccable pacing and a meticulously crafted script elevate the narrative to a level of sophistication rarely seen. The synthesis of these elements creates an immersive experience for the audience, effectively communicating the intricacies of Elvis's life and legacy. In summary, the film is a triumph, seamlessly blending exceptional acting, thoughtful pacing, and a compelling script to offer a captivating and poignant exploration of one of music's greatest legends."
Elvis (2022),Good acting but a poor script.,"Elvis's life was packed full of drama and conflict but all of it is thinly covered in the film. For a film/movie to work there needs to be a strong protagonist and a strong antagonist so that the conflict is clear. In this film the conflict is warterd down and Elvis isn't a likeable character. All we learn about him is that he loves his mama and will do anything for her. That's not enough for him to be likeable and the writers and the director should have seen that. The production values are good, as is the acting, but I found myself asking how can I be bored with a film about ELVIS? The greatest star to have ever lived. Elvis fan's will like this film but if you're not a fan, it is watchable."
Green Book (2018),Unrivaled Oscars roadtrip drama,"This awards juggernaut is definitely ever deserving of all the praise it has gotten, and yet another great testament of Peter Farrelly's stellar filmography, truly an amazing drama, to say the least. The actors all do an incredible job, all of them great names, and providing a perfect mix of drama and some humour playing off each other. Very well written, expertly paced, and warm in its own way. The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, and the film is very beautifully put together indeed. Very unique, and very well crafted in terms of shooting. Overall, definitely an ever recommended Oscars winner, every lover of film should experience this poignant and ever important film!"
Green Book (2018),"Uplifting, inspiring, and realistic!!! (Heavy Spoilers Ahead)","The basic plot of this movie is that an Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work, as his club is undergoing a several-month renovation project. Upon request, he applies for and reluctantly takes on the role of driver for an African American pianist savant, Dr. Shirley. Dr. Shirley wishes to tour and perform in the Deep South during the Segregation period, which provides many different challenges. That's what a quick DVD synopsis might tell you, albeit more eloquently. The message of this movie is what makes it truly special and heartwarming. While this film pulls no punches when exploring both subtle and overt racism, it also shows that people from vastly different backgrounds can come together and become friends, despite the world's insistence on preventing just that. Although Mortensen's character is loud-mouthed, abrasive, and oftentimes an outright glutton, Dr. Shirley also has his own flaws (holier than thou demeanor, giving unwanted lectures, etc.). Despite beginning the journey in a rough manner, the two become close friends by the end of the tour, even improving each other in areas where they were most stubborn. By the end of the movie, each was willing to sacrifice his own needs, to help the other. This shows the power of looking beneath the surface of a person's shortcomings, which is applicable in any time period. Both individuals were flawed for a reason, having been scarred from past experiences and acquaintances. Green Book solidified the message that friendship can come from the most unexpected places...but that does not make it any less real."
Green Book (2018),Undoubtedly a feel good film,I had a great time watching this movie and I vwas extremely surprised to see how many negative reviews it had. The only real problem I had with this movie is that some of the scenes felt a bit dragged out and its 130 minute runtime could definitely have been shortened down a bit. But calling this movie uninspiring is crazy. This was both an inspiring movie about the struggles of both black and white men in 1960a America and also a heartwarming story of two dudes bonding over music. Both mahershala Ali and Virgo mortenson gave A grade preformances. I see people referring to it as a not all white people are bad story but like you can't be expecting them to change true events. 9.2/10.
Green Book (2018),"I hate movies with a message, but this is a good one.","Liked it very much. At first I thought this to be the usual super-pedagogical anti-racist ""movie with a message"", which I hate because the message is mostly too obvious and in your face, trying to lecture the viewer. However, this one is different. Both protagonists have their fairly distributed faults, strengths and weaknesses. None of them is solely victim or perpetrator. The differences between them are multi-faceted, not only between black/white, but also between rich/poor, homo/hetero, intellectual/down to earth, arrogant/likable, lonely guy/family man. The narrow-mindedness of institutionalized racism is clearly demonstrated. Both actors do a fine job, the male bonding between this two contradictory characters is quite believable. It works fine as an entertaining road movie, albeit the ending reminded me a bit too strongly of Planes, Trains and Automobiles."
Green Book (2018),A Captivating Journey of Friendship and Understanding,"""Green Book"" is a remarkable film that embarks on a journey not only through the deep south of America but also through the complexities of human relationships and societal prejudices. Directed masterfully by Peter Farrelly, the movie is a blend of humor, drama, and a poignant exploration of racial dynamics in the 1960s. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver exceptional performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. Mortensen, as Tony Lip, embodies the rough-around-the-edges bouncer with a heart of gold, while Ali, portraying Dr. Don Shirley, brings an air of elegance and dignity, masking his character's inner struggles with societal constraints and loneliness. The chemistry between the two leads is the heartbeat of the film, evolving from mere employer-employee relationship to a genuine, deep-seated friendship. It's this evolving bond that forms the core of the narrative, making every shared laugh, disagreement, and moment of mutual support something special. The screenplay is another highlight, offering a balanced mix of humor and seriousness without delving into cliches. The film tactfully addresses issues of racism and segregation, without losing its warmth and charm. Its depiction of the era is both eye-opening and thought-provoking, offering a window into a not-so-distant past. What makes ""Green Book"" stand out is its ability to tackle serious issues while maintaining an uplifting tone. It's a story about breaking down barriers, understanding and valuing differences, and the power of human connection. This film doesn't just entertain; it enlightens and inspires. The direction, acting, script, and the incredible soundtrack all contribute to making ""Green Book"" a memorable film. Its message of love, respect, and friendship resonates long after the credits roll. This is a movie that deserves all the accolades it has received and is definitely worth a watch. In summary, ""Green Book"" is a beautifully crafted film that offers more than just entertainment. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in a world divided by differences. A solid 9 out of 10."
Green Book (2018),A great book... Like a great,"Title: ""Green Book: A Harmony of Friendship and Social Commentary"" In the tapestry of cinematic storytelling, ""Green Book"" stands as a poignant masterpiece that harmonizes the complexities of friendship against the backdrop of racial inequality. Directed by Peter Farrelly, this film unfolds as a compelling narrative inspired by true events, offering a resonant exploration of human connection and societal challenges. Set in the early 1960s, ""Green Book"" introduces us to Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American bouncer with a penchant for solving problems with his fists. When the Copacabana, where Tony works, undergoes renovations, he finds himself in need of alternative employment. Enter Dr. Don Shirley, a highly accomplished African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour in the Deep South. Hired as Dr. Shirley's driver and protector, Tony is thrust into a journey that transcends geographical boundaries, unraveling the layers of prejudice and ignorance. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Tony Vallelonga is a revelation. Mortensen captures the essence of Tony's transformation from a man driven by stereotypes to one who confronts his own biases, delivering a performance that balances humor and depth. Mahershala Ali, in the role of Dr. Don Shirley, brings a quiet dignity to his character, navigating the complexities of being a talented, sophisticated musician in a society that refuses to see beyond the color of his skin. The heart of ""Green Book"" lies in the evolving camaraderie between Tony and Dr. Shirley. The eponymous ""Green Book"" refers to a guide for African-American travelers, listing establishments where they would be welcome during an era of segregation. This symbolic roadmap becomes the physical and metaphorical bridge that connects the two protagonists, transcending racial and societal divides. The chemistry between Mortensen and Ali is the film's driving force, portraying a genuine friendship that defies the prejudices of the time. The screenplay, co-written by Farrelly, Brian Hayes Currie, and Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son), strikes a delicate balance between humor and social commentary. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the harsh realities of racial discrimination but uses Tony's unfiltered perspective to inject humor, making the narrative accessible without undermining its serious undertones. The cinematography by Sean Porter captures the landscapes of the Deep South with both beauty and unease. From the opulence of concert halls to the harsh realities of roadside motels, each frame contributes to the storytelling, emphasizing the stark contrasts of the racially divided America of that era. Music plays a pivotal role in ""Green Book,"" reflecting the characters' emotional journeys. The soundtrack, featuring a blend of classical, jazz, and popular music, underscores the cultural differences and commonalities between Tony and Dr. Shirley. The musical performances, particularly those by Mahershala Ali, add another layer of authenticity to the film's portrayal of the transformative power of art. While ""Green Book"" received acclaim for its performances and storytelling, it also faced criticism for its approach to tackling the issue of racism. Some argued that the film oversimplified the complexities of systemic discrimination, while others praised it for using a more accessible narrative to broach the subject. In conclusion, ""Green Book"" is a triumph of storytelling that navigates the delicate terrain of friendship and racial tension. Through the prism of a real-life journey, the film addresses societal issues with humor, heart, and a profound sense of humanity. It invites the audience to reflect on the enduring power of connection and the capacity of individuals to overcome prejudices. ""Green Book"" is more than a movie; it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and a reminder that understanding and compassion can emerge even in the most challenging of circumstances."
Green Book (2018),If you're contemplating if it's worth it...IT IS!,"I consider myself to quite the movie connoisseur. I watched the trailer for the movie and was intrigued enough to give it a shot. Talk about an over delivery. Understanding the assignment. There wasn't a dull moment the entire movie. It was one of those films that makes you keep checking the time because you don't want it to end. The film covers every single part of the emotional spectrum: fear, pride, confusion, anger, humor, and most of all happiness. This film was directed flawlessly from start to finish. You're immediately drawn in by the unorthodox character dynamics. The character development is intentional, meticulous, and complete. The race dynamics were vivid and jarring but not generic. I found myself smiling ear to ear when this movie ended, I'd give it a standing ovation if I wasn't watching it from my bedroom. Well done."
Green Book (2018),"Understated, Genius and Hella Funny","Brilliant actors Ali and Mortensen team up to deliver great understated performances in a friendship-heavy road movie that tackles America's 1960's segregration troubles. And yes, you should definitely put it on. Right off the bat, this is not a tearjerker nor a moralistic film at all. In fact it's a film that just shows you what it is, as a sophisticated black piano player with a lot of courage drives from show to show in the deep white South, backed by his hard-as-nails Italian driver. It's a very welcome way of portraying heartbreaking practices in society, keeping its focus on the good we have inside, especially between these two unlikely friends. It pulls a trick to achieve this, deliberately skipping the hard moments and only showing the aftermaths, stripping it from too much drama. The camera just never loses sight of either of our friends, and that makes it an exceptionally good film. Also, it has a mad sense of superb humour, and some great music to top it all of. It's heartwarming, understated and funny when you least expect it. What more would you want to put this on."
Green Book (2018),Just as is in the book. The world could be a better place if we were each of the main characters.,"I'm not going to ruin this movie by writing all of the details down here. However, I will suggest giving it a watch. The main actors pulled their parts off so well. Thanks to all of the actors, to the writers, production team, camera team and everyone else, including all of the tea/coffee girls/boys. I read the book not that long ago. I never knew there was a movie too. So if you're thinking of reading or watching either then I'd recommend reading the book first followed by the movie. As for Vigo he has a whole list of movies to look for on here. He can play literally any character with any accent in any situation. Thanks for reading my ramblings."
Green Book (2018),The Godfather meet The Pianist.,"Green Book is a well told story about an American-Italian man that works as a driver for a popular black pianist, that is a square, careful man that is really into his musical things. Alongside the driver, who is more of a who-cares man, and the contrast between these two is showed very good, very clearly, and it was fun watching it. Green Book is taking up important genres. Family, racism and acceptation. The movie is settled back in the old time America were the blacks rights were better, but still on a low quality. Including the important things they talk about, it was very funny, too. The jokes were fun and intelligent, and they included some very nice ironic sentences. The story is very holding, it is almost like reading a book, with different chapters. Every chapter, was one city where the duo was on a concert. And they were driving and driving, and sooner you got longer into things, you are getting more about The Pianist and his backstory, and why he is so uptight and serious all the time. About the technicals. The pictures and scenography did really the job with some retro atmosphere, as well as some good songs, including some very old symphonies too, that is definitely a fun thing to listen for musicians. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both great and put power into their role, and they did their job great! Concluding everything, Green Book is more than just a green book, it is a story of two different persons that meet each other, with a completely misunderstanding, but later on, they show how you can be a good person and that you must open yourself to show who you really are. It was a good drive."
Trolls (2016),Norse mythology meets Yellow Submarine,"Full disclosure: I've never been into the Troll toys. I learned of them probably when I was eleven, and only through reading the trivia about this movie learned that they got created in the '50s. OK, with that out of the way, I guess that ""Trolls"" was an okay movie. The plot reminded me of the Beatles' movie ""Yellow Submarine"", wherein a happy, colorful place gets overrun by a group of beings who turn it into a miserable, colorless place (obviously in this movie there are no Beatles to come to the rescue). The songs - including an Academy Award-nominated one - didn't really catch my attention. With most movies I tend to focus on the plot, even if it's a children's movie. I will say that the movie has some splendiferous animation. Last but not least, I of course have to mention the cast. The combination of Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Christine Baranski, James Corden, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kunal Nayyar, Russell Brand, Gwen Stefani and Quvenzhané Wallis makes this movie a link between *NSYNC, ""Into the Woods"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""The Big Bang Theory"", political comedy, No Doubt and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"". Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. Nothing special, but harmless."
Trolls (2016),Trolls,"Anyone recall the toys you used to get where you could push play-dough up through the body and it would come out through holes in the head like coloured hair? Well that's what these ""Trolls"" reminded me of - a wet dream for marketeers, toy makers. And burger chains. The actual plot centres around the peaceable trolls who must flee their home when the menacing ""Bergen"" arrive bent on eating them all for a ""trollstice"" treat. ""King Peppy"" and his annoyingly optimistic daughter ""Poppy"" lead their people to a safe hideaway but a surprise visit from their nemeses means ""Poppy"" and her pal ""Branch"" have to set off to rescue them from the merciless cleaver of the ""Chef"" and the new young ""King Gristle"". What now ensues is a series of escapades as they quite literally have to escape from the pot and the fire, stop their entire population ending up garnished and maybe, just maybe, convince their foes that happiness does not, in fact, come from eating a troll - well not unless it's a chocolate one. This will probably play well to very young children - there are lots of vibrant colours, a few songs to liven things up and just a hint of ""Janet and John"" moralising about what truly matters in life. It's a film you'll watch once, but I doubt it needs revisiting."
Trolls (2016),My kids are obsessed,"My little ones love all the trolls movies so much. We showed up late to the party and just started watching them a few weeks ago. The third trolls movie is in theaters right now. They love all of them but the first one is so good. I wish they would have put the troll wig in the second and third one. Like they all come together to make a troll wig for the Berkin troll Bridget. We love them all. The music has been the best part: it's so much fun to jam to the album in the car with them. I wish there was a poppy doll with a cowbell: I would have already bought it by now. Good job, everyone involved in this film. It's made my kids so happy."
Trolls (2016),Great Cartoon,"Trolls It was excellent, who could not love a community of trolls where they have music, dance and hugs on the hour. The story had a central message that happiness is inside all of us and we just need to find it. Whilst simplistic on the story front, it was inspired in its music, animation and dance numbers But what really was the cherry on top was the strength of the characterisations brought to life with very nuanced animation, and the voice acting casting was inspired. My favourite was Branch followed by the Giraffe looking like troll. I'm giving this a firm 6 outta 10, well worth watching and good honest entertainment."
Trolls (2016),Pixar just wishes it had this much fun freedom animating!,"This film is crazy cute and so cartoon-like over the top, it's really refreshing seeing this brought to the 3d space. The animators and artistic directors did a fantastic job and each little expression and hand gesture just added to it perfectly. The story is ok, but everything else was perfect. Well done DreamWorks! This is far better than, this came to life or that came to life, same style, same story. Though Pixar tells a better story, but 30 years of the exact same animation style really shows they are not trying to push the boat. (maybe beside monster inc.) This is a totally different and unique universe."
Trolls (2016),A happiness shot,"Animated musical adventure that is bursting with color, fun, and infectious positivity. The film brings to life the vibrant and whimsical world of the Trolls, with each character exuding charm and personality. The adorable and lovable Trolls, led by Princess Poppy, voiced by Anna Kendrick, are impossible not to adore. Anna Kendrick's lively and spirited performance as Poppy perfectly captures the character's boundless optimism and determination. Her singing talent adds an extra layer of delight to the film's catchy musical numbers. Justin Timberlake lends his voice to the grumpy and skeptical Branch, whose journey alongside Poppy adds depth and balance to the narrative. Timberlake's performance brings a heartfelt sincerity to Branch's character, making him relatable and endearing. Trolls is a visual feast, with its bright and imaginative animation that transports viewers to a world of glitter and rainbows. The film's creative use of color and visual effects creates a joyful and immersive experience for both children and adults. Beyond the colorful exterior, Trolls also delivers a message of embracing individuality and celebrating the beauty of being true to oneself. It teaches the importance of finding happiness within and appreciating the uniqueness of others. The film's soundtrack is a standout feature, with catchy and upbeat songs that stay with you long after the credits roll. It's a musical treat that will have you tapping your feet and singing along. While some may dismiss Trolls as just a children's movie, its heartwarming story and positive messages resonate with audiences of all ages. In conclusion, Trolls is a delightful and heartwarming animated adventure that spreads joy and positivity. With Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake's charismatic performances, a vibrant and imaginative world, and an infectious soundtrack, it's a film that will leave you with a smile on your face. If you're in the mood for a fun-filled and uplifting movie that celebrates friendship, individuality, and the power of music, Trolls is the perfect choice. So, join Princess Poppy and her friends on their whimsical journey and get ready to dance, sing, and be reminded of the happiness that lies within us all."
Trolls (2016),Naysayers Are Way Too Serious! This Was Fun!,"Coming in, I was skeptic on whether Trolls was going to be an awful Lego Movie wannabe, that I was prepped with banters and ridicules. Lo and behold, I swallowed all negative assumptions as Trolls was quite an entertaining ride. It simply nails what it sets out to do, as it had us grinning ear to ear from its well placed jokes, head bopping from its insanely catchy soundtrack, & mesmerized with its oh so trippy visuals. Apart from these, the character quirks introduced that perfectly complimented the actual toy's appearance, were amusing & sensical. Story-wise, it's lack of complexity was a breath of fresh air, yet its messages on true happiness had substance. Overall, Trolls is a feel good movie through & through. Sure it's a film made for young ones, yet I find my 35 year old behind rallying behind it! If only this film was released during my hay days, there could have been better appreciation for that hideous naked toy, with groovy hair."
Trolls (2016),This is concerning,"I am not one to make angry reviews, but this one is concerning, as someone who has dealt with kids, this movie should not even exist to begin with. First off, the story is very much one-dimensional, the 2 sides are the Trolls (The ""heroes"" since they are always happy), and the Bergens (The ""evil"" ones since they are always sad), they both fight since the latter tries to eat the former to be happy, very much a weird start. So it starts with two Trolls, Poppy who is the stereotypical overly happy lead, and Branch who is the one that is stereotypically sad and angry, and they are clearly the ones who will be in a relationship at the end, and all the other Trolls are here to have a huge party, and the Bergens find them and take some away to eat them, yes I know I'm skipping a lot, but I am only going through these plot points because they are important, so then Poppy goes to find the Trolls that were stolen, and Branch eventually joins I think I barely remember anything despite the millions of times I have watched it, then about maybe 45 something minutes in and they make it to the Bergen's castle place to confront the King and stop the consumption of Trolls, later they found out they got caught and then put in a cooking pot, then they start losing colour from sadness, this would be a good time to end the movie, but it keeps going, then the girl Bergen saves them and the Trolls later have the 700th dance sequence and it ends. Sorry that I missed so much, I only wanted to get the important beats (Quite literally story BEATS, since this is a musical...) out of the way. So that's the ""plot"", so first things first, the message, and this is why this is concerning, the message is that you should quote ""only be happy"", I know a lot of parents would say that the message is that ""you should feel happy to feel better"", but I am not buying that, the message is clearly the propaganda type of ""you MUST be happy and ONLY happy"", and that goes against the positive messages of things like Inside Out, Hamtaro, and Sesame Street, and I cannot imagine the damage that this movie could do to children, since with the humor, and the colour choices clearly tell me that this is for toddlers. Now, the humor, it's what you'd expect, fast paced, sometimes bait and switch, and toilet humor, like there is a glittery Troll who deficates glitter or something, and that was a point in the first musical number in the movie. Finally the music and casting, the music is basic pop songs, some of which I like, but I have to admit it is the most generic choices ever, and they throw these musical numbers every few minutes, and it is annoying, and about the casting, its the generic Illumination style of casting based off of popularity and not based on how good an actor could be for a character, that' all. Overall, dont' expose your kids to this, just watch stuff like the examples of what I consider Trolls to go against in messaging, and other stuff with good morals, and always watch first on your own to make sure the content is right for your kids if you have them."
Trolls (2016),Good for a childrens movie,"I'm pretty sure this film is directed at kids, but because I'm a stubborn adult who watches movies for a living, I had to rate it. Happy go lucky troll Poppy and her grumpy old sidekick Branch get captured by some creatures called the Bergens and the Bergens try to eat them. And how do they escape? That's right, singing. Because that is the most common and practical way to escape any dire situation. But then again, it's a kids movie. What are ya gonna do? Anyway, the whole plot is that dancing and singing are the best way to get you out of anything, and there is obviously no meaning behind this film. There are some good moments. Like with Bridgette, the good Bergen, who helps the trolls escape, by sneaking the trolls out through her rainbow hair. Oh, and I also forgot to mention. This film is heavily focused on hair. Hair. Hair everywhere. You know those troll dolls from the 80s-90s? Yeah. That's them, but colorful."
Trolls (2016),My Guilty Pleasure,"I can't hate this movie. I just can't. The only grievances I have are some badly placed jokes here and there and three and a half annoying characters (James Corden Troll, glitter troll, Yolo troll, and Anna Kendrick troll (sometimes)). The one scene where Anna Kendrick raids JTs bunker almost made me yell at my TV but that's the only rage inducing thing present here. How is this any different than 99.9% of animated movies? This movie suffers from ""Frozen Syndrome"". An animated movie becomes so popular that it's popular to nitpick, exaggerate on, and loathe entirely, when in reality, it's a solid kid's movie that grown adults are angry about kids enjoying. Grow up!!! Anyway, I love Justin Timberlake troll, Anna Kendrick troll (sometimes), mclovin bergen, the maid bergen, john cleese bergen, and the chef. This movie has a lot of genuinely funny jokes that remind me of the Shrek movies (the good ones). Most of the songs are catchy. I love the animation style. The highly detailed felt on everything was a joy to look at. I love the contrast of snarky Anna Kendrick playing a happy troll and happy Justin Timberlake playing a snarky troll. Also the ship of them is really cute and I'm gonna secretly rent the third movie just to see what happens with them romantically. I'm being serious. Also the ""singing killed my grandma ok"" thing is actually really sad in theory it's just the execution that's balls to the wall hilarious. I feel bad for Justin Timberlake troll but i still laugh at his circumstances."
Tár (2022),Solid performances but forgettable story,"Cate Blanchett puts on a very strong performance here. Sadly the story here does not match the same level of her performance. My expectations were especially high for this movie because of all the Oscar Nominations it received back in 2022. The story moves at a snails pace with taking forever where it wants to get. I even found myself nodding off from time to time watching this film. Don't put this movie on if you are already feeling sleepy trust me. The highlight here is certainly Cate Blanchett's performance but nothing else really. Ta
Tár gets a very middle of the road 6 stars out of 10 from me."
Tár (2022),A film of subtle context.,"Todd Fields 'Tar' is an impressive, subtly chaotic drama that keeps you hooked on what is typically made to be a boring scene. This movie is more or less the downfall of Lydia Tár's, the composer's, career. She is about to make another breakthrough with her career as she's about to record her symphony but everything seems to work not in her favour. As she battles with her relationship with her wife, the accusations made from the suicide of Krista, the legal battles as the accusations of sexual exploitation, and overall the downfall of her career as she battles her trouble causing emotions too. This movie shows us that it is never good to bite more than you can chew. The hierarchy of power in any setting can have serious impact on anything, in other words, sexual exploitation. It's the impact todays society has on the world today with 'cancel culture'. The story is beautifully constructed and it's ability to switch from one scene straight to the next is something remarkable I feel most filmmakers don't have the guts to do. The construct of Tár's character and it's development is amazing and gradually perfect. The development of the story is great and the turning points are plotted in just when you think all is well. The cinematography is so subtly done it works wonders to the eye because whilst it doesn't seem to be very cinematic you can tell it is still all in the shot despite there not being dynamic colours to express emotion or very specific camera movements. The long shots taking place between conversations is remarkable and represent the stableness in Tár's career and how later the scenes are a bit more complexly edited and chopped up representing the unstableness of Tár's career is amazing. Cate Blanchett played this role terrifically, the screenplay must've been written for her as she literally is Tár and encapsulates everything Tár is meant to be and feel to an awe. Todd Field really went all out with this film. His choice of subtle camera movement is great but what's most important is how he works around with the actors, the sets, and all else. The ending of this film has left me in absolute brilliance as it perfectly encapsulates todays society especially in the last shot/reveal. Tár has done the impossible and has added 'Gen-Z' into an absolutely terrific film without ruining it but instead making the best use out of it and even using it for the plot. Even using it to truly represent the downfall and what Tár's career has come to. This film deserves further analysis and re-watches as of how brilliant the film really is."
Tár (2022),Who is the target audience?,"This film has been on my watchlist for ages, and I postponed watching, being worried that it would take a big emotional tall for me, who is a professional classical musician, trying auditions and having to deal with conductors and orchestras on a regular basis. After watching it, with difficulty, I can say that being disappointed is an understatement. I'm just so curious who is this film meant for? It's very pretentious and goes very into very detailed conversations about classical music, but in a shallow and unrealistic way. I also would've expected that the music would be a big part of the storyline, however from the beginning you're greeted with a soundtrack that I can only describe as nails on a chalkboard."
Tár (2022),Behind the Long Scenes and the Histrionics - A Terrific Film,"I enjoyed this film showcasing Cate Blanchett's remarkable performance as a renowned conductor and the change of pace as her character Tar goes completely off course. I didn't object to the lengthy interview early in the movie. It struck me as a valuable conversation you might find on public television. Blanchett demonstrates the conductor who can think quickly and respond off the cuff to questions posed by Adam Gopnik, a New Yorker Magazine writer. Tar is obsessed with the details of her profession and strives to get perfection from her orchestra. The scene at the Julliard (with one student named Max) showed her anger when someone is unable to appreciate the talent of great artists who don't conform to his personal stereotypes. She tried to use it as a teaching moment but she did become unhinged and Max stormed out. It was soon after that when she her ability to conduct a world-class orchestra begin to unravel. It also showed how flawed her own judgement would become from the artist who took Max to task by letting his personal feelings cloud his judgment. The change was gradual and then the total descent was almost more than the viewer can take. What happens is a sad commentary on how human emotion can stunt a tremendous talent. Without giving away too much more, I would say that the character of Tar became quite different as her personal life came into total conflict with her role as a conductor. It is a tremendous movie, with major credit to Cate Blanchett's powerful acting talent."
Tár (2022),Great but flawed -- both the main ccharacter and the movie,"I have just enough musical background and training to be able to understand what people were talking about in this movie. I have zero talent, though; so, really enjoyed the insights into the life and mind of a professional -- every slow, detailed, didactic bit of it. The story was truly a tragedy in the classical sense because the protaganist was great on a heroic level but was brought down by a fatal flaw. Without going into detail, she was much better at music than at personal relationships. In my opinion, the ending was not totally sad because she stayed connected with her roots, going forward making music with like-minded people even though on a much more modest scale. Lucky, asian orchestra and sci-fi audience! As for the movie's flaws, others have mentioned the choppieness of the 2nd half. It felt like it was badly edited. Even professional reviewers had varying versions of what was going on. If you haven't read a plot synopsis, you may need rewind."
Tár (2022),An out and out Cate Blanchett show,"I was completely transported into the world of western classical music and the life of a conductor with Tár. Cate Blanchett was incredibly impressive with her acting from the word go. I think she completely embodied this character and as a viewer I felt I was voyeuristically observing her, as her life and transgressions slowly unravel. Every other character in this movie played only a supporting role towards showing this happen. Some scenes are legitimately unsettling and difficult to watch, and I mean this in a good way. I think, like me, if you find yourself invested in seeing the slow but definite downfall of this complex character you won't necessarily feel the drag of the screenplay. I do wish some aspects were developed more than others. In my initial thoughts after the film's ending, I felt there were a few loose ends and incomplete story arcs. But upon reflecting on the film I have been able to see that they were in fact resolved. The issue is that too much is left to interpretation and some symbolism will surely be missed on the first viewing. On the technical front, the cinematography and colour grading give a distant, cold aura to the film much like the protagonist herself. I also quite liked the almost horror and thriller-esque vibe that they went for. On a side note, when I looked up the director I felt he looked familiar and turns out he played one of the scientists in Twister! He's clearly come a long way and I will check out his future directorial works for sure."
Tár (2022),A Symphony of Subtlety and Power,"In ""Tár,"" the cinematic world is treated to a masterpiece that resonates with a unique rhythm. It's a film that demands your full attention, unfolding at a pace that is not slow but meticulously measured. For those willing to immerse themselves in its narrative, the movie offers a rich and enjoyable experience. The storyline is a compelling exploration of the complex interplay between immense talent and the pursuit of success. Lydia Tár, portrayed with exceptional nuance, navigates the high stakes world of classical music. The film masterfully illustrates how subtle manipulations can spiral into profound consequences, presenting a narrative both contemporary and timeless. This isn't just a film; it's an experience that lingers with you, challenging perceptions of power dynamics in creative fields. With a rating of 8 out of 10, ""Tár"" is undeniably a must-see. It's a testament to the power of cinema to both entertain and provoke thought, leaving an indelible mark on its audience."
Tár (2022),"Blanchett is Phenomenal, But a Film I Appreciate More Than Enjoy","I watched Tár over the course of a few hours, frequently pausing the film and watching something else, then coming back to it. Or taking a nap. I don't think calling this movie boring is that controversial; the first 40 minutes of the film are deliberately difficult, an excruciatingly long interview opens the film and it's follow quickly by a dinner conversation that goes on for way too long. To say Tár did not need to be 2 hrs and 37 minutes long would be beating a dead horse. Of course it didn't need to be. It is beause it reflects the sort of pretentious, grandiose person Lydia Tár is. Tár, at its core, is a character study and a parable about modern times; a film about cancel culture and the accountability of cultural icons. Cate Blanchett truly disappears into this role and delivers a powerhouse performance here. It's hard not to sound like a broken record, but she really becomes Lydia. There's an amazing physicality to her performance along with her incredible affectations and ability to portray Tár consistently, even whilst speaking different languages. I also found the film's sometimes meandering pace to be compelling as it gave us a chance to get to know people without necessarily figuring out where they all fit in Tár's life. It really made the film feel like a slice of life, where the story has a lot of context before the movie begins, and will go on after (naturally, given the ending). It's also a very well made film; the cinematography and sound design, thankfully, are impeccable. You really get sucked into whatever room you're in and there's an overbearing sense of atmosphere, a coldness associated with the refined world of classical music. Yet, this is also a movie I'd probably never watch again. It does a lot quite well, but is too simple a plot to waste so much time. Most of the other um...non, Tár characters, are pretty paper thin and we don't really have any particular subplots or complex relationship dynamics. As the movie lurches towards its end, I felt like it implies a strong emotional connection to what's happening, but it never really made it. This is a story that could've been told in a very conventional, straightforward way, but it's smarter than that. It takes a pretty nuanced and difficult-to-discuss subject and tackles it head on, but in a way that feels as if it's an aspect of the character's life and not the whole thing. Tár, like many Oscar bait films, has a lot to appreciate. But, I genuinely don't believe it's the sort of film many people will honestly remember and appreciate years down the road."
Tár (2022),For Classical Music Lovers Only...,"I watched all of the lengthy film Tar in one sitting, but that was only possible because I have a strong background in classical music (piano). At some points, I felt as though I was watching excerpts from Robert Greenberg's educational videos on the history of music (The Great Courses). In fact, some of the anecdotes relayed in this film were familiar to me only because of my prior exposure to the erudite Mr. Greenberg's massive oeuvre. Lots of reviewers are comparing this creation to Whiplash, and there is something to that comparison, but mainly the story revolves around a person who seems more concerned with her own status than anything else. Others see reflections of Black Swan. I agree that there are overlaps, but this is not a copycat film. The film is beautifully shot and contentful enough not to be boring--but only if you are a part of the world of art music. Otherwise, I imagine that it would be very tedious to get through. I rather liked the ambiguous ending, which seems to be a trend, judging by the other new movies I have watched of late."
Tár (2022),Must see ! Cate Blanchet at his best,"This is truely a good movie like we use to have good script- amazing actors-great plot and great cinematography. I saw it yesterday on HBO and didn't care for it until I realize the build up and crazy ending. I'll have to watch it again I missed too much... so much to understand. Must of been such a good time for an amazing actor like Blanchet to portray a female conductor, this is a subject we aren't use to penetrate and observe. I love everything about this film so personal so different in such many ways. This is a grand movie and Blanchet deversed an Oscar for it or at least a nomination there nothing easy or lazy about this film with amazing shoots specially the one with the new male student at the beginning."
Pitch Perfect (2012),Aca-scuse me?,"I saw Pitch Perfect in the movie theater ! Twice .... Love it ! It Has Anna Kendrick In It ! This is helpful. She is so adorable, talented, beautiful, and witty ! FYI she really sang all of her songs in all Pitch Perfect movies, Anna Kendrick reportedly refused to pre-record her vocals. Any time protagonist Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, was singing alone, she was singing live on set. A movie about girl weirdos doing what they love. Bonus ! Rebel Wilson's performance! I found myself liking the film whether I wanted to or not . I just ordered the Trilogy Blu-ray !! Relive the best moments with your favorite pitches! Triple the laughs, the adventures (or misadventures), and music with this three-movie collection."
Pitch Perfect (2012),The pitch was alright,"This movie was about a capella singing so I can't say it was something I thought I'd enjoy but honestly it wasn't that bad. The singing was really good and I really enjoyed every treblemaker song. The humour was really really hit or miss throughout the whole film. Some of the jokes were unbearably and just downright awful, mostly to do with those presenters. Occasionally they were kinda funny. Some of the dialogue is really awful and the use of aca before every word was excruciatingly painful. And it wasn't once or twice, it happened so frequently and every time it did I wanted to bash my head off a wall. Overall wasn't the worst movie but there were definitely better. 7.5/10."
Pitch Perfect (2012),I absolutely love this movie might be odd since I generally hate musicals,"This movie hits the spot to me I watched so many times when it was HBO and saw the sequels in the theater just wasn't reviewing then. I love the chemistry with all the cast, the music is magnificent, so much charm, and plenty of great entertainment that makes me so happy! I very much enjoy the cast I bet they are fun to be around. The vomiting scenes are awesome comedy, the directing is phenomenal in my opinion! I wonder if I'm one of few that loves The Pitch Perfect movies although part 3 isn't as good. I bet college is great fun I wish I was normal enough to go having autism is a bizarre experiences."
Pitch Perfect (2012),Endings are the best part,"As I watched this movie for the first time this week, I knew it was rated a 7.1 average on here. But as I sat through the majority of this movie I thought to myself - what do people love so much about this movie? I mean I remember when it first came out how it made such a cultural impact and was very popular. But the majority of this movie feels old and uninspired in 2023. The jokes and sub plots were all very mediocre and some didn't age well. But as the movie starts to wrap up, it hits its literal and metaphorical climax. The final 20 minutes makes this movie worth watching! Feel good movie."
Pitch Perfect (2012),So bad I created an account just to rate it,"One of the worst, most cringeworthy movies I've ever seen. The characters are unrealistic, stereotyped, and shallow. They are all such awful people that you don't care about any of them. They don't act like actual humans would at all. The humor is crude and offensive, but not in a funny way like Borat. The movie has a ridiculous amount of projectile vomit, which comes out with the force of a fire hose. The only good thing about the film is that Anna Kendrick is kind of cute. As for the music, it's all so highly-edited that it doesn't even remotely look like the actors are actually singing. For a movie about acapella singing, I was hoping for higher quality performances and less stereotype humor."
Pitch Perfect (2012),Nice,"Maybe if I watched this film when I was a teenager I would have liked it more. I'm from 1996, I grew up watching High School Musical, Hairspray and Glee (in fact, the way Beca is discovered by the choir is the same way they discover Cory's character in Glee). Later, as an adult, I watched musicals like Descendants, Zombies and Hamilton. Both very good, but one thing I missed in this film is the charisma of the characters. Maybe if I try hard I can see Beca's charisma but compared to other musicals, that's very little. They have a ""Regina George"" but it's extremely boring. It's obviously predictable, so I won't judge that. The things I liked were that competition that had Russian roulette choosing the type of music, the Bellas' final performance was interesting too. It's not something I would rewatch again, maybe just this last performance where they sing several songs in one. Film Watched on September 15, 2023."
Pitch Perfect (2012),The perfect movie to rewatch over and over again,"This movie is so incredibly perfect and contains many components for a rewatch. Now, I am inside the demographic to enjoy this movie heavily but, I have loved it for YEARS. In 2012 when this movie came out I was VERY young and ever since then its been playing either on a screen or (and I have to be real) in my mind. The songs are such earworms and I am always singing along with the movie. The movie is about an all-girl acapella group who fell off the past year at their singing championship and are attempting to fight their way back to the top. I 10/10 recommend for a watch or a rewatch!!!!!!!"
Pitch Perfect (2012),pitch perfect,"Oh my gosh,...........anna kendrick and anna camp are hilarious in this movie. It's one of the most fun movies ive seen in a long while and 2000s and early 1010s definitely had the fun movie area covered. The music and the acapella singing were great. It made anna kendrick a star and also our first introduction to adam devine's character. Adam devine was so hilarious in this movie. The singing and just the novelty is great. We could actually tune out and enjoy ourselves and have a fun time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a fun time in with your family or your loved ones or even by youreself with some hot chocolate."
Pitch Perfect (2012),love,"Everything about these movies is great. They are so ridiculous and funny. I've seen them multiple times and they just don't get old. My favorite is pitch perfect two. I love that the girls bond at the summer camp and I love Hailee Steinfeld as the new girl. Super sweet and well done on the acting. My favorite characters are fat Amy, Emily, benji. My favorite a cappella groups are the Bella's and the treble makers, I also liked those rocker chicks in the last movie. I loved Jesse. But unfortunately I didn't like Becca all that much. She just seemed winey to me through out the series. All that to say, great mindless movies to watch for a good laugh."
Pitch Perfect (2012),A fun surprise,"*Pitch Perfect is a fun film that's easy to enjoy* Pitch Perfect caught me off guard with how fun the movie is. It's a sneaky PG13, because the movie will go on like a Disney channel exclusive when all of a sudden you get hit with a crude joke that you can't help but laugh at. The cast does a good job playing their roles, though at times the characters can feel a little one dimensional. The plot is simple yet enjoyable. But what makes the movie the most for me is the music. I might just be a sucker for A Capella (which is weird seeing that I don't listen to it ever) but the soundtrack to the film is great. Overall, if you haven't seen this movie in a while or ever, and want to feel good at the end, I would recommend this movie."
A Star Is Born (2018),Gaga shines!!!,"The movie ""A Star Is Born"" is a musical drama about a musician, Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper), who discovers and mentors a struggling artist, Ally (Lady Gaga), while battling his own addiction. Bradley Cooper, in his directorial debut, masterfully delivers the fourth adaptation of this movie. He chooses to depict a more contemporary version, portraying an America that is grappling with darkness and illness. Furthermore, Cooper effectively transforms a popular singer into an actress who perfectly fits into Ally's role. Lady Gaga delivers a knockout performance, showing the nuances of a struggling singer with power and authenticity. The movie also stands out due to the intense emotional journey of an artist at the end of his career, battling addiction to alcohol and drugs, and the healing power of music. The exceptional soundtrack enhances the storyline, further accentuating the performances of the lead actors."
A Star Is Born (2018),Not very good,"The film is inexplicable predictable , not just the plot . Most scenes were painful to watch and not in a good way Sorry I just cant follow Jacks pain and alcoholism its not portrayed in a believable way and I know what I am talking about . Hes not a bad actor hes just not doing it right. The story moves ahead like a ton of bricks falling down the stairs all while its supposed to be earnest , emotional and down to earth But you cant feel the big time of their success and you cant feel the pain of the couple as their path goes separate ways . The best scenes are inthe start with Ally La vie en rose and gagas a decent actor in portraying her initial concern but once shes in love the movies over. Fine with a modern adaption but this was painful like bad danish socialrealism( Im a dane)and I struggled to watch it to the unnessary end."
A Star Is Born (2018),Fine but not wonderful,"Hello reader, this film it's to be for a people that likes melancholy and dramatic films. For this kind of person this film it's so good. I mean, the story it's okay and the soundtrack also. Bradley Cooper is amazing and Lady Gaga better than Bradley. So yes, it's a good film but it's not for me. I really like other kind of film but many people recommend me to watch this movie so I am here. It's a pleasure for me to read that because I am an amateur person to write this kind of things and this is not my mother tongue. Thank you so much if you think that this review it's okay. The film is very interesting and I really recommend to see for every kind of person Thank you for read !"
A Star Is Born (2018),"A Star is Born contains some of the year's best acting, Bradley Cooper exceeded our expectations with his multi-job and direction, a masterpiece","In preparation you might say for Bradley Cooper's anticipated ""Maestro"", I'm rewatching A Star is Born which I saw shortly after it came out back in 2018. It was Bradley Cooper's directional debut and a brilliant one which made him into an auteur, a brilliant filmmaker, with ""Maestro"" which is making a buzz at the Awards. He co-wrote it with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, along with producing it. A Star is Born became a box office success with $436.2 million of a $36 million budget. It's the fourth adaptation of a film/story which came out back in 1937, it's well known and liked by critics and a story which is easy to like. Matthew Libatique served as the cinematographer for the film and was nominated for an Oscar for the film. They worked together splendidly, creating spectacular shots which stay in your mind for a long time. The production design were top notch. The musical soundtrack, sound design and sound mixing were superb. A musician helps a young singer find fame as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Dave Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Elliott. Cooper and Elliot playing brothers, Jackson ""Jack"" Maine and Bobby Maine respectively. Over to the lead actors, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. Their chemistry is great and the love story between the characters are excellent, like I said before, it's a story that is entertaining. Bradley Cooper have played many roles over the years, most if not all are terrific and this one is among the best. He portrays Jack in this raw and realistic way, making him three dimensional. I think with him co-writing it, he could make it into the best performance possible. With an actress like Lady Gaga beside him, their chemistry and her already having extreme talent for singing, he just had to learn to sing which he proved, brilliant. Lady Gaga is brilliant in the role for the more dramatic parts as in combining emotion with the music and songs in the film, selling everything for critics and audience. For her acting and soundtrack contributions, Lady Gaga became the first woman in history to win an Academy Award, Grammy Award, BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award in one single year. When it finally goes good for the characters and especially Jack Maine, we get a tragic ending to a beautiful love story. We got to follow Jack and Ally through their ups and downs, learning how it's true love between them. From the scene at the parking lot which is one of the most memorable scenes in the film, along with them singing Shallow together for the first time and them marrying. It's as a beautiful love story as it's tragic, both overall and how it ends. What Jack tells the AA group after the Emmys, about his past attempt of suicide and his father's drinking, everything comes full circle. This is one depressed individual. Jack's tinnitus getting worse by each act is a big part of why he feels depressed and continues with his two addictions, alcohol and drug abuse. If you set yourself in Jack's shoes, a musician who doesn't know what else to do and will lose your hearing, of course you would feel depressed. Then when the manager comes and says all that, sadly, I can see why Jack chose that route. Bradley Cooper deserved an Oscar for his role for this film, his mannerism, change of voice and accent, everything. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4.5 out of five stars, and deemed it as a ""modern classic"", hailing the performances of Cooper and Gaga, and Cooper's direction. He found the film's screenplay and the original songs ""seamless"" and ""terrific"", and also called the film a major Oscar contender of the year and one of the year's best films. It was a big Oscar contender and his review is overall easy to agree with. Both the American Film Institute and National Board of Review chose it as one of their top ten best films of 2018. The film also won three more accolades from the National Board of Review, including Best Director (Cooper), Best Actress (Gaga) and Best Supporting Actor (Elliott). At the 91st Academy Awards, A Star is Born received eight nominations, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for ""Shallow"". A Star is Born is worthy of all its praise, all its awards. I can't really find anything to criticize other than its not really an original story. But what it does is perfecting every part of the genre and any similar stories and films out there. Bradley Cooper was the right person to adapt the material. It's a spectacular experience, a film I wish I saw at the cinema. My girlfriend loved the film as well, showing its a film for everyone, not really for children though because of the profanity and dark themes."
A Star Is Born (2018),Stars are gone,"136 minutes of boring songs, a romance without chemistry, unremarkable performances from both leads, subpar directing (those never-endings close-ups of Gaga and Cooper are tiresome) and very slow pace, cliched story. Both Cooper and Gaga are wonderful artists in their own right but here they have gone nowhere. A typical Hollywood product, piled on top of the previous film of the same name with similarly mismatched stars: Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Overall, it leaves quite a depressing feeling. What was the point of resurrecting this old story without bringing anything new or fresh into it."
A Star Is Born (2018),Lady Gaga's performance was LEGENDARY,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined. The plot of the movie was very interesting and the storyline was very well written. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The casting of the movie was AMAZING and their performances were brilliant, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper nailed it. I have to admit, it wasn't as intense as I had imagined. However, the ending scene was very emotionally intense and kinda sad. In my opinion, the opening scene was kinda boring, but the 2nd act was really good. Also, the soundtrack of the movie was really good and most of the songs were very emotional. Moreover, the cinematography of the movie was unique and I really liked the aesthetic of the movie. Overall, ""A Star Is Born"" was an enjoyable drama movie, emotionally intense and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
A Star Is Born (2018),Very Manipulative in Trying Times,"The plot in this movie takes a poorly thought out turn in the end. In today's world where depression and suicide are rampant, the entertainment industry needs to take a proactive approach. This movie definitely wasn't that; in fact quite the opposite. Shame on the writers and actors:actresses. People in entertainment see this disturbing trend as much or more so in their profession. Would it not have been a better movie, a better outcome for those really struggling if Bradley Coopers character could have been healed of his demons. I certainly would have had more respect for the actors/actresses if the script encapsulated that. I certainly will not support them at the box office now."
A Star Is Born (2018),another one of these movies..,"I want to start off this review by saying I'm a big fan of Lady Gaga, and also Bradley Cooper's a great actor.. but... that still doesn't change the fact that this movie was just another one these types of movies, another romance/drama, another ""undiscovered talent"" movie. Its just another one of those movies, nothing special, nothing different, nothing unique, nothing new brought to the table. Generic, the same old same old, which makes it just plain boring and dull to watch. Now this is the part where I would say I don't understand why everyone loves this movie, or I question why was the movie so popular, but I know why.. Lady Gaga, she's most likely the only reason why everyone seems to love this movie.. but for me that isn't enough to make me like or enjoy this movie. Its just too generic, too dull, and way too overhyped. And the overplayed Shallow song also made me despise this movie even more, so yeah."
A Star Is Born (2018),Tell me something...,"An incredible love story as old as time. A man is a talented musician whose career is literally bursting at the seams. A woman is an equally (or more) talented singer who doesn't believe in herself. A random encounter, a spark and a new life. For me the film is about love. Love as inspiration, tolerance, acceptance, jitters, strength and weakness, tenderness and cruelty, sensitivity, and an incredible gift. In this movie, love is the sound, the roar of the guitars, the power of the voice. The soundtrack is amazing, thanks to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Special thanks for the lack of ""fakeness"" in the actors. The result was a very harmonious, beautiful and lively couple. The film enchants and immerses. It squeezes out all the juices, extinguishes it, but also gives hope."
A Star Is Born (2018),Powerful,"I know nothing about Lady Gaga's music, but have now watched her in American Horror Story and A Star is Born. If her music is as good as her acting, maybe it's worth a listen! She is amazing in this role. As is Bradley Cooper in his. No spoilers, but try picking Andrew Dice Clay. He probably surprised me the most....in a good way. Fantastic all round. No wonder this has been remade 4 times. What a great story, particularly considering how long ago the the first movie came out. Whilst I have never seen the Kris Kristofferson/Barbra Streisand version, (or the other two) this has been adapted well for today. The message is timeless, powerful and very moving."
The Pianist (2002),Haunting WWII film.,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run."
The Pianist (2002),Actions speak louder than words,"Me and my girlfriend are going to krakow over the weekend, and obviously a trip to auschwitz is on the cards. Having already seen the film once I wanted to watch again so I felt like I was in a much better head space for the trip. Adrien Brody is a great fit for this part. And his lack of speech in the whole films shows just how horrifying the actions of the Germans to the Jewish community were. We are fully on this journey with him, and it's heartbreaking the journey he goes on, especially having to leave his family to go to their death on the train to treblinka. The scene where the German SS throw the wheelchair bound man out the window always sticks with me. I can't believe he went through all that to nearly get killed by his own men mistaking him for a German! It's a shame Szpilman wasn't able to repay Hosenfeld his kindness, but maybe that is karma after all!"
The Pianist (2002),I love it!,"One of the most exceptional movies about the Holocaust, The Pianist, features an outstanding performance by Adrien Brody, whose nuanced and gaunt portrayal left me speechless and still does so. The movie's impressive set design and passionately acted extras showcase the brutal sufferings of innocent lives in a powerful and purposeful way without resorting to cheap thrills for the audience. Wladyslaw Szpilman was not a hero or a fighter but a survivor whose salvation depended solely on luck. The film's believability and realism stem from its ability to convey this truth. Although the movie can be emotionally draining and heartbreaking, it is worth the sacrifice. The story of the talented Polish pianist is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit."
The Pianist (2002),good,"It's a great movie that shows how bad a person can be when given the opportunity. The movie shows what doesn't tell us anything. It shows that children,people are mercilessly slaughtered for no reason just because they are Jews. And those who do this job enjoy it. I think there is such a monster in all of us, who feels anger towards others who consider ourselves superior. But it is not absent in our human values, pity ,compassion, we all have such feelings. The film is taken from a real event.. The main character is based on the Pianist book written by Szpilman. In this regard, many of the events experienced and shown have been handled first-hand. I watched the first hour of the movie with my mouth open. For a moment, when it really happened, not as a movie, I thought someone stopped and took it on camera, the atmosphere, that environment, the gun scenes, the deaths, the hunger were perfectly reflected. Especially the cruelty of the Jews, the Jews, broke my heart. It's definitely a movie that needs to be watched. If you think that I need to add something to my life, open it and watch."
The Pianist (2002),An amazing biographical art,"For me, really quality. It caught me a lot, because I like the theme of war in movies and this was excellent. It was also helped by the fact that it is a story based on a true event. It was a great build-up. It was great at the beginning, but then it kept going and from about halfway through it really grabbed me and I was really entertained. The last moments of the film were a blast. Suspenseful, I'd say slightly moving and simply gripping. In my eyes, this is an amazing film. I think it's a great choice for war movie fans, but don't expect an action movie. It might even catch the attention of people who aren't into war movies that much. It's not about the action. In short, a good quality biopic. I thought it was great."
The Pianist (2002),A cinematic masterpiece,"There's only so much I can say about this masterpiece. ""The Pianist"" is a hard watch, it's a man's journey to survival. It's a man's personal history of how he survived the Holocaust. It's not the typical holocaust movie. ""The Pianist"" sheds a very important light on the atrocities happening outside of the Jewish ghetto and outside of the concentration camps. Many atrocities and many monstrosities continued to happen every day outside of all these places. Strong images, great craftsmanship from Polanski. A very expressive Adrien Brody in the pinacle of his career. Very powerful, poetic scenes, my favourite being the piano scene by the end of the movie. A very well crafted movie, a journey through hell and back. I really wonder how have I never watched this movie before. An absolute cinematic wonder!"
The Pianist (2002),Powerful yet slow,"The subject matter is very tough with its oppressive tragedies but it's moving & important. The recreation of this period is very convincing & well made but without personal connections the plot drags with no big moments. .

The Pianist (2002),Masterpiece,"Marvellous narrative of the WWII Nazi-occupied Poland, beautiful picture, striking acting & escalated suspense make this film a classic and one everyone has to watch...!! The story is set in 1939-1944 Poland, depicting the persecution of all Jews, their violent transfer to the appalling labor camps, and for many, losing their lives in the extermination camps. The artistic element introduced by the leading actor, piano melodies intertwining with the film climax are delivered in a masterful way, keeping the people watching the film immersed into its dramatic tension and its dark yet precise representation of the horror those who would survive had to go through, starving, seeing death everywhere, feeling the constant threat of the Germans killing them. Very emotional story, delivered with its impeccable cinematography."
The Pianist (2002),The milestone in cinema.,"Perhaps it comes just near to Schindler's list , regarding genocide of 2nd worldwar epic. The innocent look of the main character , the pianist , a Jew with sharpnose and angle like calm adds to the beauty and effect of film. The characters in the society and brutalness of German soldiers towards Jews , reminds ...what a man can do with other fellow humans...worst. The breaking of Czechoslovakia and the human sufferings and so called cleansing reminds the repetition. The work of Roman Polanski is superb. The picture ends with a good note...the hero , Pianist survives and performs over Polish TV after war ends."
The Pianist (2002),A masterpiece,"The Pianist is a really slow, gritty film full of drama and suspense. We don't know if our main character is going to live to see tomorrow, even as his comrade who helps him escape is shot in the head before his eyes. We hold the heavy, emotional burden of the Holocaust as we watch this, knowing what's happening all around Poland and Europe. And what's particularly unique about this film is it actually starts out very colorful, but as the film and story progresses, the color is slowly drained from the scenes. This is an excellent use of coloring in cinema in order build character and story, to show decay. It's also music that saves this man's life, which is so symbolic for so many artists throughout the world. Without our art, we could not live to see tomorrow. But in this one man's story, it quite literally saves his life, for his piano-skills is what impresses the Nazi officer who feeds and hides him. We really feel like we're in the ghetto in the war, and I think only Polanski could've done this because he lived through this too as a young boy."
CODA (2021),PLEASE release on DVD!!,This is a remarkable film and should be made available to more people than can afford Apple+. I was able to see it in a theater. WE were all just wowed by it! That it won the Best Picture award also reinforces that opinion. I know streaming is a popular option for watching films but not everyone streams! There are many films that are only on streaming that really should be made available to others! Many are available in more than one format but Apple+ does not offer this option. If you have not seen this film and can access it - it is well worth seeing. Wonderful cast and a really great story!
CODA (2021),"This film os A bad copy of the French film ""The Belier Family"" from 2014.","This film os A bad copy of the French film ""The Belier Family"" from 2014. A poor, crude and worse version of an original story, with a very united approach and style. The original French film has the delicacy and poetry of french style cinema. I don't understand how academy gave an Oscar to a bad copy. Please compare the versions. It includes elements that are totally unnecessary to fill out. The process of maturation and self-discovery of the protagonist, in relation to the differentiation with the rest of her family, is violently introduced in this film and not as a process of discovery of herself, which also has to do with a process vital choice and personal freedom."
CODA (2021),Such a delightful film!,CODA is such a moving film about family and love that it really resignated with me. I had heard all the great things about this film and I can confirm they are all true. What's nice is this is a film for all and I believe will be very moving toward a lot of people. Terrific performances throughout with a very strong script. I also really enjoyed the cinematography that is on display here. Apple has showed as of recently that they are a powerhouse with coming out very high quality original film and tv series. Do yourself a favor is go watch CODA. CODA was such a positive experience and that is why I'm giving it a high 9 stars out of 10.
CODA (2021),A Beautiful Movie,"I'm in love with this film! It was a beautiful drama, with a very interesting storyline, and amazing acting. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me stare at the screen in awe. What more could I possibly want from a movie? CODA, is the story of the teenage daughter of a deaf family, struggling to find her independent place in life, but still worrying about what might become of her family. Emilia Jones was so brilliant! She is an amazing actress, and a perfect singer. I specially enjoyed seeing her work in the intense arguments she has with her family. Hopefully we'll see her long and very successful career in cinema. Watching CODA was a wonderful experience. This will be one of the few movies I've rated 10/10."
CODA (2021),"Love, music and family","Coda centres on a high school girl in the US at a crossroads in her life. As the only hearing member of a deaf family we find out that she's spent a lot of her life since an early age having to translate and interrupt for her family when their out and about. Perhaps unfairly they've come to heavily rely on her whether at work or elsewhere. Things change though when she's motivated to join a school choir which takes her off in a whole new direction. She's actually a good singer though shy and awkward. The acting is actually really good, the slouched posture, downcast head and grungy clothes all convey this sense of awkwardness and fatigue. It's hinted that she's not had much time in her life to play and be free when growing up, she also struggles to connect with her mother who mistrusts their outside community. The film packs quite a punch and there's also an interesting subplot about difficulties with the family's fishing business and their fight against the big man who's pretty soon going to put them out of business. The film wonderfully captures the sense of warmth and also awkwardness in families, the way parents embarrass their children, the way children can embarrass their parents. The conflict though between dreams of a music scholarship and staying behind to help her parents becomes the central conflict of the film. Another interesting character is a passionate music teacher who devotes time to our lead character to help her follow her dreams. The music, lighting, editing are all great without ever becoming distracting or taking away from the performances or story. I feel that's really their proper function and too many filmmakers have forgotten that and made the characters and story come second too often. The story is set squarely in a film town and it's not until the very end that we finally find ourselves in a big city. The film has it's share of tropes, crowd pleasing moments and so on but there's a freshness and rawness to it that means you don't really mind actually. It's largely down to our main character who comes across as attractive, likeable, shy and just very natural and real. The film while largely about music is not afraid to use silence too to give us the other perspective. It also subtly explores the ways in which deaf people are often excluded from being able to do basic things. The love story is also very sweet in a simple uncynical kind of way."
CODA (2021),What the heck?? Like an After School Special,"The Best MP of the Year should have you on the edge of your seat dying for their line but this?? Is this the Academy's attempt at being Woke? For shame. This literally had me bored. I wasn't sure which story mattered- the deaf not allowed to fish, the start of a fish sale co op to get their fair share or the daughter trying to get into Berkeley cause she can sing? I don't get it. It's a 5. What's wrong with you people? You've drinkin the cool aid alright. This was sad. I want my 2 hours back. In the future someone will watch all the best pics & when they watch this garbage they're gonna wonder who paid off who! I do."
CODA (2021),The most beautiful and meaningful film I have seen in a long time.,"His win at the Oscars could open new doors for Hollywood's deaf-mute acting community, which has struggled for years for more visibility in television and film productions. Such was the case in 2020, when the Korean film Parasite won the prestigious statuette and led to a surge in series and feature films produced by South Korea's film industry. Therefore, the message and representation of the deaf and mute community that ""CODA"" presents may be the inspiration we are looking for or the story that is simply worth telling. CODA: Child of Deaf Parents is a nice, warm and funny movie that I would put on to watch on Saturday-Sunday. This is a story worth telling, seeing and most of all hearing."
CODA (2021),Formulaic and forgettable except for parents during 1st half or so,"I've seen so many variations of the basic story, so many variations of the basic characters, so many... you get the idea. It would be switch off almost immediately for me if it weren't for the portrayal of the parents in the early scenes, maybe half the run time? Each on their own would be a slight positive but not a whole lot. What worked was the interaction between them. Probably the son adds needed oil to make this work but his character lacks any interesting writing. Anyway, they are worth 3 stars on top of the 1 star I would otherwise rate. As for the rest of the cast, characterizations, set design, music, everything, yawn, yawn, yawn. If CODA benefits anyone deaf then I'm happy it is widely seen. And if the deaf actors genuinely are deaf then I'm happy they got to show off their chemistry. That aside, nope, not for me."
CODA (2021),Beyond Words,"The 2021 Best Picture Oscar winner combines elements from ""Children of a Lesser God"" and Peter Yates' ""Breaking Away."" It tells the story of a family with hearing-impaired members who heavily rely on their daughter, Emilia Jones from Netflix's ""Locke & Key."" She not only works in the family's fishing trade but also serves as an interpreter in various situations, both at home and abroad. Despite her desire to join the school choir, she may have an opportunity to win a scholarship to a music school due to her talent, supported by her choir teacher, Eugenio Derbez. Jones' older brother, Daniel Durant, feels overlooked, as he believes he should be the one addressing the family's needs. Their parents, Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur, must learn to trust and involve their hearing relatives so that Jones can pursue her dreams. While the film may be more admired than loved, it still delivers powerful moments, such as Jones singing 'Both Sides Now' by Joni Mitchell while signing to her family from the balcony. The movie also features Ferdia Walsh-Peelo from ""Sing Street"" as Jones' love interest and fellow choir member."
CODA (2021),I'm late to this,"Wasn't on my map until Oscar buzz and $ is limited so I waited til streaming was free. I'd like to say this is my new favorite movie but it's not my typical genre. That being said I have already watched it twice and shared with my boyfriend who is totally closed off mentally to any movie that isn't ""shoot 'em up, John wick"" style. Even he loved it! It's an incredibly touching, heartwarming coming of age movie that will give 'hearing' people perspective. The acting is phenomenal... the pace is great and everyone can relate to family loyalty vs. Autonomy or can at least understand it from these brilliant actors and wonderful script. A definite Must See! Highly recommend!!"
Baby Driver (2017),Stupid movie,"This movie sucks, the whole movie was based around a teenager that owes a lot of money to a mafia boss. I hate the main character as bad as i hate this movie. Firstly, the main character is so annoying, he is such a traitor and he ruined the whole plan just to seem good, all of his teammates were killed because of him. Secondly the last fight was so dumb and cringy. Those guys were literally pushing eachother with each others cars in an underground parking. Third of all, there were some part where the movie tried to become funny but i didnt even smile, the jokes were terrible and awful. Lastly, the main character for no reason acted like a bad boy and he thought that he was cold by responding ""no"" and then not saying anything. This was so annoying and made me uncomfortable. I rhink that this movie was a waste of time and i dont get the positive reviews."
Baby Driver (2017),I dont get it.,"I dont get it, you are supposed to support the guy who killed a lot of people because of his childish restarted little tantrum? He killed his crew members on purpose for no reason, just because he is indeed a little baby🙂. I was definitely rooting for the 'villain.' Furthermore highly predictable and unrealistic, do not recommend, main character is so annoying, should definitely just stick to music. Ending was as cringe as it could get. It's so overrated. Plot is mid and the execution is even worse. How is it a 7,5??? Just because of some driving skills and bank robbery so cool😎. Also how tf you fall in love with someone who served you some food once, its like they skipped every step."
Baby Driver (2017),One of the best of the 2010s,"Edgar Wright took his writing and directing to the next level. One of the most precise and cleverly detailed movies I've ever seen. Whether it's the scenes timed with the perfectly picked soundtrack or the little nuances of the characters, it truly is a critics delight without being too dense. Although it is a precise and a detailed movie it still somehow is immensely entertaining! Packed with such action, great romance, great one liners and overall humor, and some of the most likable, crazy, evil, and cool characters of the decade. This is a film that shows why I love movies. It is my personal all time favorite and there aren't many movies that show how magical film is better than Baby Driver. Every aspect of the film what made for movie goers and everyone will leave this movie with a smile and wanting to dive into the world of film and see what it has to offer. Not only is it my favorite movie but it also is the reason I'm writing reviews and have seen countless films since. A perfect movie for critics and regular movie fans alike. 10/10 for Wright and a must watch for anyone who has one said they love movies."
Baby Driver (2017),A Fun But Slightly Shallow Romp,"Having only seen the trailers for Edgar Wright's ""Baby Driver"" when it came to theaters in 2017, I had a rough but undefined idea of what the film was about. I knew Ansel Egort's ""Baby"" was a, well, driver, and I knew that Kevin Spacey (Doc) was his mentor. Perhaps unfairly, I assumed the film was a lot of action and not a lot of heart. And, funnily enough, the opening scene did very little to change that base assumption. The scene was incredible, mind you - with Baby and a group of robbers (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez) escaping the police in one of the most unique, thrilling, and pulse-pounding scenes I've seen in a LONG time - and I thought my previous prediction of how the rest of the film was going to play out was spot on. Not the case. Instead, ""Baby Driver"" flips the script on the viewer following the opening scene, diving much more into the protagonist, Baby, and his blossoming relationship with a lovely waitress (Lily James's Debora) then pedal to the metal action. The driving scenes are still there (and engaging, I might add), but this shockingly turns into an unexpected love story, especially during the second act. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, as Egort and James have fine chemistry and are unique characters, but issues start to arise when Wright tries to seamlessly blend this world with Baby's more hardened, violent world of crime. It is understood by us, the viewer, that this juxtaposition of worlds is the crux of the drama in the film, and that's fine, but the characters simply aren't refined enough - and the dialogue not strong enough - to really make us care about our Bonnie and Clyde-esque heroes. The final result, a heart-pounding first half followed by an emotionally dull latter half, is amplified by fantastic performances from the aforementioned Egort, Jamie Foxx as the sparkplug ""Bats,"" and the terrific Jon Hamm as the engaging ""Buddy"". I would be remiss not to mention Eliza Gonzalez consistently stealing scenes as the sensual sharpshooter, ""Darling,"" as well. The film shines in its unique sound-mixing and stellar soundtrack, both lauded by critics upon the film's release. These two elements are great, there is no question, but not enough to make up for a few of the gaffes previously mentioned. It boils down to this: ""Baby Driver"" is fun, engaging, and unique; all important elements in making a fantastic picture. Unfortunately, Edgar Wright seemingly says all he has to say in the first twenty-five minutes of the film. After that, it is less heart and more tired formula. A good film that had the potential to be great."
Baby Driver (2017),Synchronisation of music and movements,"The story of ""Baby driver"" is a rather confentional crime story. The main character wants to make a big splash, pay off his debt and leave the criminal scene with his girl friend. Something special is the fact that the main character is not a member of the criminal gang but their getaway driver. Unknown to me this seems to be a sort of sub genre of the crime movies with films such as ""The driver"" (1978, Walter Hill) and ""Drive"" (2011, Nicolas Winding Refn). Really special about the movie is the way the movements of the main character are in sync with the music he listens to. In his time Federico Fellini (for example in ""Otto e mezzo"", 1963) had music on the set to make the movements of the actors more rhythmic. This music was however not a part of the soundtrack as it is in ""Baby driver"". The main character is a modern guy in every way and wears little earphones. The soundtrack / music he listens to is however predominantly 70's. The title of the film seems to be inspired by a Simon and Garfunkel song and the flight the main character has in mind with his girlfriend resembles in some ways the ending of ""The graduate"" (1967, Mike Nichols), also a film with Simon and Garfunkel music in it. A few years before ""Baby driver"" (2017) there were a couple of films in which modern devices had a big influence on the lives of the main characters. I am thinking of ""Her"" (2013, Spike Jonze) and ""Ex machina"" (2014, Alex Garland). In this respect the earphones in ""Baby driver"" seem just a minor gadget, but I think this is an underestimation. The earphones enable the main character to keep the real world outside. This way he never has the feeling to belong to a criminal gang, he just facilitates them."
Baby Driver (2017),Impeccable Cinematography,"""Baby Driver"" takes the wheel as a cinematic thrill ride and easily earns its stripes as one of your all-time favorites. The fusion of heart-pounding action, a killer soundtrack, and impeccable cinematography propels this film into a league of its own. The movie's kinetic energy is palpable, thanks to the adrenaline-pumping driving sequences that not only serve the plot but also become a character in their own right. The seamless integration of music elevates the experience, turning each chase and heist into a symphony of visuals and sound. Behind the scenes, the directors demonstrate a keen understanding of their craft. The placement of cameras and the strategic direction of the narrative showcase a mastery of storytelling. The film's trajectory is not only well-paced but also takes unexpected turns, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. The element of surprise reaches its peak with a character's unexpected demise. The shock factor adds a layer of complexity to the story, defying expectations and contributing to the movie's overall impact. This narrative curveball not only showcases the filmmakers' willingness to take risks but also adds emotional weight to the plot. What sets ""Baby Driver"" apart is not just its initial impact but its enduring rewatchability. The film's ability to draw you back into its world, whether for the heart-pounding action, the catchy tunes, or the cleverly crafted cinematography, speaks volumes about its lasting appeal. In the grand tapestry of cinema, ""Baby Driver"" stands as a testament to the art of merging action, music, and storytelling. It's a cinematic joyride that not only earns a spot among your favorites but also promises an exhilarating experience with each subsequent viewing."
Baby Driver (2017),Original action movie / (musical!),"Baby Driver has to take credit for being one of the few original mainstream action movies in many a year. It's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously with some great jokes thrown in, but importantly the action does not take a back seat at all. We get some of the best car chases in recent cinema and an extended foot chase that keeps you gripped and breathless all the way. It is the music and editing that makes this movie wonderful, the soundtrack is all fitted into and incorporated into the visuals of the film. We see all sorts of movements and interactions by the actors and also the surrounding environment which is just genius. A quick example on the street is we hear someone at an ATM inputting their PIN and the key tone matching the soundtrack as the actor passes by briefly. There are loads of small details like this that only get spotted in repeated watches and make it a very rewarding watch. Ansel Elgort deserves praise for his lead as Baby, a role that has him dancing as well as running and driving. It's no exaggeration to call this movie an action-musical and it stands out for its originality and a great break out performance for him inparticular. Some parts are a little cheesy and look too polished, an example being the police cars that chase in a very choreographed formation (though maybe this is part of the 'dance'!). But these are far outweighed by the value we receive and the surprising depth of detail throughout. Well worth a watch for its originality alone."
Baby Driver (2017),"Not a Wasted Frame, Not a Wasted Letter","Edgar Wright's a director who has an instantly recognizable style to his films. Even if you can't put it to words, you watch a scene you can feel Wright's style oozing from every frame. That is the first thing viewers will notice in this film is its style. This is the best example of how to edit a movie to the music. This movie feels like a rhythm heaven game with how well the action fits the soundtrack. Thankfully, this movie isn't a style over substance kind of movie. The story and characters are likewise compelling. I mention the editing so much because, dang this is a sharply edited flick."
Baby Driver (2017),Attempt at something original but doesn't work,"The whole music theme is a decent idea but it just doesn't work and it mostly makes for some awkward and weird scenes. Also, the main character is too perfect at everything and trying to overly look ""cool"" constantly. I think younger viewers are rating it high. The only good things are:
 The car stunts/scenes are well done The tension when Bats and the crew go to the Diner. (Bats in general was one of the better characters, his scenes are good because he seems genuinely crazy and it gives tension). The love interest was done quite well, although I think a lot of that is that the girl is really attractive and likeable. They don't actually do that much together romantically, which is a mistake to getting the viewer involved. It feels like it was a little bit inspired by ""True Romance (1993)"" for the romance and their plan, which was similarly an likeable and fun girl. But it's just not done as well. Maybe if the main character was more relatable and less perfect, that part of the story would be better."
Baby Driver (2017),Crazy Action Flick,"So I appreciate what they've tried to do by making it different than the other car chase action flicks out there. But while I just love the cast and most of it is so good for some reason some of it
fell flat for me. Maybe it was just the way the romance develops because for me it was definitely unique but also jarring watching a romance when I was there for the car chase action and crime. But don't get me wrong it is definitely so much fun and I just loved the part with the foster grandpa. I love Jamie Foxx being annoyingly nuts, and John Ham and Eiza being all crazy Bonnie and Clyde. I love the nuance in Kevin Spacey's character too. I just feel like the way the romance story was , just not my thing I guess. So yes, definitely watch if you like good soundtracks and car chase, CRAZY ACTION."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),"Very hard to watch, not a movie about good music and dancing.","I heard so much about how good the dances were in this movie with John Travolta, and was willing to give this a shot, but unfortunately this is not really what this movie is about. I know this is supposed to be how it was like back then with realistic things and that it's not always going to be a lighthearted side of the world with flowers and rainbows, etc but the amount of swearing, suggestive themes and violence (including a rape scene) is very appalling. It's like after seeing these great dance scenes and music, it cuts down to people calling each other insulting names and swearing at each other, having sex in cars and explaining suggestively how they're enjoying it, or attacking one another. It's just disturbing and disgusting on how this movie is, not sure if the PG version is totally clean from this but unfortunately that version is hard to come by. The dancing and music of this movie is great but not the rest of it."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),"Rape, racism and good music","The movie barely has a plot, and is filled with explicit sexism, racism, rape scenes and normalisation of it all. Even for a movie from this era, it's tasteless. The women are all objects for men to toy around with. The ""interesting"" Stephanie, who's framed as being more successful and escaping the lower-middle-class status of the area, is developing throughout the movie to lose her morals and even getting together with Tony right after he tries to rape her. The plot is lacking direction, character development and excitement. A lot of loose threads are not followed up on, and what could have ended up as a true character development, just ends up as a big flop. We had big expectations, unfortunately none were met."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),A steamingly hot John Travolta and Bee Gees' immaculate music,"The wonderful, glossy disco culture was abruptly killed off by some bitter dissenters insecure of their own manhood during the so-called ""disco backlash"" in the summer of 1979, but luckily it lives on thanks to this profound and stylish film from John Badham, starring a steamingly hot John Travolta and Bee Gees' immaculate music. The script by Norman Wexler may well include one or two slight cheesinesses (including the climax at the bridge), but the writing is completely eclipsed by the atmosphere, style and testosterone captured on camera here. Few films have captured an era better than Saturday Night Fever, and Badham recognises and makes the most of the purity and edge that is created at the intersection between 1970s youth culture, Travolta's buoyant energy, and the pulsating disco music. Today the film works as dual escapism, but it's no less relevant and no less valid than it was back in 1977 because the essence it captures is timeless - even if the wonderful music turned out to be ephemeral."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),Decent Movie,"Rating: 6.8
Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances. Pretty Good Direction (Able to move the movie forward and executes the dancing sequences very well, but besides this, he really does not get that much out of his actors and there are a lot of questionable scenes), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Very Good from John Travolta (In a very ""John Travolta"" way, a film that really puts him on the map for his exaggerated character), Decent from Karen Lynn Gorney (Has some good moments and has some questionable ones), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (A lot of the characters play the stereotypical New York Italian and it just gets so annoying to watch/listen to after a while)), Decent Story (Pretty formulaic and easy to predict, nothing really of substance), Decent Screenplay (As a whole, it is fine and gets the job done (very surface level), but there are just way to many stereotypical Italian mannerisms that it gets annoying), Great to Incredible Soundtrack (The actual songs were Incredible, but there were moments where I felt the director did not use the soundtrack properly (like reusing songs)), Pretty Good Cinematography (The cinematography comes to life in the dancing scenes as I liked the very low angle shots to show how big of a dancer Travolta's character was), Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Costumes (Very Disco-esque attire), Plot Structure was structured pretty well with no major problems (except the end kinda falls apart as it really could have ended 10-15 minutes earlier), Pacing was fine, Build to climax was not well done as the movie builds to the competition as if it is th the climax but the real climax is after (therefore, it just feels like it was building to nothing); climax was kinda boring as it was not what the movie was building to, Tone was very 70s/disco/New York Italian and it was made very clear with the dialogue and the mannerisms the characters have, The actual message of the movie is good but it is just so hard to believe as the character of John Travolta goes back to his foolish/degenerate ways right after as soon as he has his epiphany; also the movie really did not age well with its themes and language (but I guess it tried to portray the average New York Italian youth in that era)"
Saturday Night Fever (1977),Saturday Night Fever,"I was but ten years old when this was released, so never saw it at the cinema at the time - but boy was it big news. John Travolta was fêted all around the world as the white-suited hipster ""Tony Manero"" who almost glided around the city streets - and the dance floor. Determined to improve his lot, he enters a disco competition which he thinks will change his life and what ensues for about two hours is his story. Sadly, it's not much of a story. He's not a very engaging fellow; treats women badly, has a mouth on him that could strip paint and is constantly at loggerheads with his hard working, decent, old man. Things take a turn for the more complicated when the apple of everyone's eye - his priest brother ""Frank"" (Martin Shakar) returns home announcing his intention to give up the priesthood for a life that doesn't require celibacy. Luckily, ""Tony"" teams up on the dance floor with the spunky ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) - a woman even more ambitious for a clean start than him - and that is where the film eventually takes off. On the dance floor, with the disco ball working it's magic and a collection of superb Bee Gees tracks that cannot fail to get your toes tapping. ""Night Fever""; ""Staying Alive""; If I Can't Have You"" and the more slow tempo'd ""How Deep Is Your Love"" make the soundtrack way, way, more memorable than this otherwise tawdry, tacky look at life in New York in the mid 1970s. Travolta is the star, his walk and his cocky style stand him apart from the rest of this rather depressingly anodyne story - but in the end it's a film about aspiration, dancing and the Bee Gees, and the latter elements are well worth watching."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),The king of the dance floor,"This is one of those movies that has an aura about it. A glamorous outer shell which serves as presentation and to cover the darkness inside it. And it works. How else could I explain that, in a movie containing both an attempted rape and a suicide, the only thing I will remember is John Travolta in his immaculate white suit breaking it down on the dance floor? John Travolta plays Tony Manero, a 19-years old American-Italian living in Brooklyn with his parents. He has a dead-end job and no plans for college. But he seems to be content, at least for now, as long as he has his friends and the 2001 Odyssey nightclub. He changes when he sees a girl on the dance floor. Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) is close to being his match in dancing skills and is also part of the Manhattan upper class. She has an office job and seems to be doing pretty well. She also takes no time to lay into Tony about his shortcomings. While her snobbism is not sympathetic, it serves to wake something in Tony. He becomes more aware of himself and the world around him. But is this sudden realization to become more responsible real or just driven by his insecurities and needs to impress Stephanie? At first it might be the latter, but as the movie progresses, he thinks about it more and more. Everything eventually culminates in a nervous breakdown one evening after winning a dance competition at the Odyssey. A win he believes he did not deserve and was given to him and Stephanie simply because the other couple were Puerto Rican. This racism--and the racism of his friends as well--pisses him off. Yet he is not driven by hatred, but rather frustrated by stupidity. I always consider stupidity a bigger insult to racism than evil because evil is held to a higher standard while stupidity is simply tossed aside. Indeed, by the end of the movie Tony becomes a man trying to overcome his condition. But don't think this movie scoffs at the lower-to-middle class. Stephanie has her own mistakes to be ashamed of mostly related to the ways in which a young woman like her might be able to climb the corporate ranks. And she is also not the only woman in Tony's life. Anette (Donna Pescow) is an ex-girlfriend of his, stuck in the friend zone but is probably the only girl who truly loves him. He is too young to understand her feelings but it's easy to see how well they are made for each other. But the movie keeps them at an emotional distance and is ruthless in their separation. Perhaps their impossibility is what makes me wish they would reconcile even more. Still, while these ideas are all fine and dandy, this movie is not without flaws. The subplot of Tony's brother Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar) is dealt with really quickly. Frank is a priest, highly regarded by Tony's parents--his mother always calls him ""father"" and crosses herself each time she mentions her name--but he shocked everyone when he decided to abandon priesthood. He doesn't have a specific reason, simply not feeling like he belongs. He then leaves the movie and is never mentioned again. But not without leaving a mark. For Tony, peer pressure is a real thing and he has a guilty sense of satisfaction seeing his brother move backwards for a change. He by no means hates him, their interactions being very friendly, but he feels pressure has been taken away from him and was given time to breathe. So is this really a flaw at all? I always claimed that a truly great movie can depict any form of evil as long as it contains the smallest glimmer of humanity. This usually comes at the ending, but not in ""Saturday Night Fever"". Director John Badham gets it out of the way early, the first time Tony sets foot on the dance floor in his outlandish sense of fashion. The ending, in fact, offers no guarantees and doesn't solve any immediate problems. When Tony runs to Stephanie's apartment we get a feeling he has matured, perhaps understanding what true love is. But in no way do I get a sense that once the screen turns black these characters will head towards the proverbial ""happy ever after"", nor they are obliged to do so."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),"If you can get past the racism, sexism, and unlikeable characters...",Good dancing. Good music. Subpar storyline. The women are totally expendable and for the men to play with. They are all one dimensional and they're for sex. The men are date rapists that like to say racial epithets. I think we are supposed to like and identify with the main characters but they are terrible people. I think you're actively rooting for them to fail. Glad I previewed this before watching it with my kids because she'd absolutely hate this. And there is a gang rape scene where they all take turns on a girl that's crying and John does absolutely nothing and it's just shrugged off and not a big deal.
Saturday Night Fever (1977),BeeGees Fever!,"Knocking this off my list of films I'd never seen and I kinda wish I'd watched it earlier. Sadly, coming to it now the story of a talented young man from the wrong side of the tracks and watching him make mistake after mistake on the road to self-discovery has been done so many times that its hard to really invest in this one, even if it does play an archetypal role in others. That said, the music is spectacular. Travolta really can dance and it is hard to imagine this movie being anything without him in it. The ending is something as well, a strong comment on cultural norms and his characters growth. Unfortunately, it's not until that end that I'm invested in anything more than the groovy voodoo of the soundtrack."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),Dated and sloppily directed but with high points,"The film has many careless editing bloopers and they detract. Also, the film is pure disco 70s and that era itself was dated by the 80s so imagine what it is now. Another problem is Travolta had reallife lady love at the time( comely actress Diana Hyland) die on him at the time and he is awful angry in scenes because of that. Yet, some of it somehow remains timeless. The theme of escaping the world you were born into, Catholic religion in your family and it's hold or loosening hold on you, gathering with your friends, dating ladies if you are a guy and more. Look. I do not use know how the film would have worked if there had been a violent lady in the film who beat people up. So many viewers are bothered by the depiction of ladies in this movie but they are all basically nice and make calm viewing. Besides, most women in real life are nice and not full of bad attitude. I will give the movie high points. PS The Catholic faith is of course based on the Bible and the Bible is crammed with scientific accuracy like round Earth and jet streams and the hydrologic cycle and more."
Saturday Night Fever (1977),Saturday Night Fever,"Saturday Night Fever was a landmark film that came to symbolise the disco era of the 1970s. It was also the the first part of a two punch knockout blow star John Travolta delivered to cinema audiences. With the follow up Grease a year later, he was heading to cinema immortality, cemented 17 years later with Pulp Fiction. This should just be a silly disco movie with nothing deep about it. I was too young to watch this in the cinema, but several years later I did watch the recut PG friendly version on the big screen. It was many years later I watched the raw expletive ridden original adult version. Based on a somewhat fictional article by Nik Cohn. Travolta plays proud but dim Italian American Tony Manero. He works in a hardware store, his boss does not pay him until Monday so he does not blow his money away at the weekend. Very perceptive as Tony lives for Saturday nights where he is the king of the disco dance floor in his Brooklyn neighbourhood. With his macho friends for company. Tony attracts female attention and is not averse to get into fights. He brushes off the advances of Annette (Donna Pescow.) He does not mind dancing with her but does not want to sleep with her as that would make her a whore. When he meets the more stylish, upwardly mobile Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney.) Tony realises that maybe his life is shallow, an uneducated guy like him is going to be stuck in the hardware store for the rest of his life. Maybe there is an escape to Manhattan and leaving his life in Brooklyn behind. Just like his revered older brother decided to leave the priesthood as that was not the life for him. There is a rawness to Saturday Night Fever, it mirrors movies like Mean Streets, Serpico and Rocky. Tony has posters of Al Pacino and Sly Stallone in his bedroom. Of course there are also classic disco songs, mainly by the Bee Gees. What makes the movie is the various dance scenes, especially the iconic solo dance moves to the song You Should Be Dancing. The movie attracted critical acclaim when it was released. It was not a movie that critics were sniffy about and puzzled why it managed to be such as a big public hit. Critic Gene Siskel cited it as his favourite ever movie. Travolta got a Best Actor nomination, the movie set the template for a dance movie for many year to come."
Almost Famous (2000),A perfect love letter...,"Years ago, I watched this film - like we all did - gave it the thumbs up - like we all did...and somehow never got around to watching it again. This evening, out of the blue, it appeared on my TV when I needed a bear-hug of a movie...the sort of movie that few do better than Crowe...and found myself immediately drawn straight to its heart. It's just a cascade of perfect moments...rather than just observing through the eyes of William...as a lesser film or story would expect you to be contented by...you find yourself sitting on the bus, in the hotel rooms, on the plane...standing elated and exhilarated at the side of the stage...you are gently coaxed into been in their world...caught in the joy, fear, enlightenment, wilful blindness, awkwardness and wonder all the cast offer you... It's a truly remarkable and brilliant piece of cinematic history and should be on everyone's ""favourites"" list... Stillwater's do run deep!!!"
Almost Famous (2000),Something to Crowe About,"Based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's experiences as a teenage music journalist, ""Almost Famous"" is one of the best rock and roll films ever made. Patrick Fugit is William Miller, a budding writer who is sent on an article assignment by a Rolling Stone magazine editor who thinks he is much older. William meets up with the fictional band Stillwater, and immediately falls for one of the band's groupies (they call themselves ""band aids""), Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who looks and sounds just like her mom Goldie Hawn). As the band tours, and does all the rock star decadence, Fugit's mother Elaine waits and worries back home. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as a mother who thinks she is very liberal and free thinking, but still worries for her child's welfare. The band eventually welcome William into their inner circle, and the conflict between lead singer Jeff (Jason Lee) and charismatic guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup). A running gag involves William's complete inability to get Russell to sit down to an interview. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderful as the late great Lester Bangs, the rock critic who is now worshiped by critics everywhere (even though all he ever did, that was different from others, was be completely honest). Lester warns William never to befriend the band, something William cannot help. As the band makes its way across the country, William gets pressure from Rolling Stone, groupies, and his mother. I usually have no sympathy for musicians and celebrities who complain and give into the temptations and trappings of the road and too much money. Cameron Crowe does not excuse the bad behavior here, he shows how it is expected of the band. They are a rock band and must behave like animals, and party, and have groupies. Crowe makes the band so likable, and real, I could not help but keep watching them. The entire cast here is excellent. There is not one false line or stilted performance to be found. Fugit, for being a newcomer, is especially good. Crowe does a great job directing, not falling into the usual rock film trappings. The concert scenes give the viewer a sense of time, place, and music, and are short enough not to bore. Joe Hutshing and Saar Klein should have won Oscars for editing, keeping the pace flowing smoothly but never showing off. I think this film flopped at the box office because the studio did not know how to market it. Who wants to see another movie about how hard stardom is? Instead, this is a sweet, funny comedy. McDormand's telephone conversation with Crudup, and the plane scene where everyone confesses their deepest secrets, are two of the finest pieces of writing EVER, not just in the film. I put off watching ""Almost Famous"" for too long, I hope you do not make the same mistake."
Almost Famous (2000),Something of an autobiography by Cameron Crowe,"(2000) Almost Famous
DRAMA Basic plot has very young writer reminiscent traveling with popular band! Because I knew about some facts about this film beforehand, I'm able to appreciate this film a little more than the people who do not! If it's watched straight up than chances are that you'll probably will not like this film at all, but because I knew that this was a semi- autobiography about the director who made this film by the name of Cameron Crowe, I'm able to appreciate and understand this film than the average viewers! Because Cameron Crowe didn't want to create any kind of hostility or resentment amongst the living, he decided it would be best if it was made as a story with made up characters. Also another one of it's set backs are that their isn't too many gifted young writer's that are able to be given an awesome job for writing for a magazine company in which not many people can relate to! As far as the story is concerned, this is what I know so far is that this film is about a young Cameron Crowe traveling with what people expect to be Led Zepplin and that it's public knowledge that he used to write for a magazine called the Rolling Stones and these are his adventures while traveling with them and as working as a writer! That because of his job, he is incapable to express any emotion or to take any sides, just like newsman, journalists and the soldiers of the army. My rating would've been higher but the scene where William Miller played by Patrick Fugit finally spoke out and says something to the band he was traveling with is a total cop out! Cameron Crowe was able to travel with this band as well as write about them and because he was a gifted writer was not able to say anything which is totally something film critic Roger Ebert could relate to since he gave this film the best of 2000! What more can be said about this except that I totally understand where Roger and Cameron is coming from."
Almost Famous (2000),"Well, you had to be there!","Apart from a terrific cast, many of whom are ancillary, that often give some of what *I* think are their best portrayals -- and snippets of some terrific rock tunes, The costumes are right, most of the cars are right -- this is a really good look at what life actually looked like. It's an endearing story, much as we wish it had been . . . If only we had all been so deep. BACKGROUND:
""...it only takes eighteen minutes a page."" Great line! Man. We were so young in '73 ( the year I graduated ). Our optimism would take a hard one to the ball-sack in '74. The Gas-Crunch was the beginning of a slide we could not stop. It could have been that Carter would pull us out of the dive but he was the kind of man you wanted as a next-door neighbor. . . ( He TRIED to get the US to establish a real energy policy ) . . . Then there was the fall of the Shah ( a putz ). It became apparent that a great neighbor was not who was needed as President. Too nice a guy. We were not worthy of him. This is after Nixon ( & Ford ), for you kids, the guy who sold us on China ( which looked like a really great idea at the time ) and saved us from being ravaged by foreign gold traders by de-linking the Dollar from gold. This was also the hamstringing of our Space Program. Then we got Reagan which frightened everyone. But it also poleaxed the Russians, which was ALL to the good. No one else could have bamboozed them like he did. Then The Wall falls, the USSR falls . . . And it has been like nine-pins -- with everyone falling. NOT that this was the only path forward to the 21st Century ( thank you Walter Chronkite ). But no one could agree on a vision that included everyone. We have been in a stall ever since. Goof-ball that he is, Musk is the brightest, if variable, star we have. And he shoots off weird coronal mass ejections in odd directions. *The next ten years ( '23 to '33 ) will be up to a generation that represents my grandkids -- Your future growth and glory is NOT on one planet -- nor in little screens, with toy blocks on them, that run on batteries that can't last for five years. You will need to reinvent yourselves into MY grandparents generation. Those were the kids born in 1900. They went, actually, from Horse & Buggy to the Space Shuttle -- in one lifetime. You CAN do this. No one can do it for you. When we are gone we will still be pulling for you. ***
A message I want all of you born after 1974 to take to heart."
Almost Famous (2000),"""Why doesn't he love me...?""","Oh, man, I actually lived through this era - personally and wholeheartedly - like many others of my generation. Every bit of this film rings true - to me at least! It captures a many brief moments in time that I will never forget. For instance, the clothes, background music (Led Zeppelin!), the mood of '73-74 post-hippie years, hard rock (naturally), sex, drugs, southern Cal living, teenage angst, and so much more. Turns out I was even in attendance at some of the concerts (e.g. Yes at SD Sports Arena!) that Crowne reviewed live at the time! Also, I'm a huge Led Zep fan and this film covers most of their best tunes. I was in Rock Heaven! And the castings is unparalleled! Also, there are many inside observations, such as, ""Does anybody remember laughter?"" spoken by Penny Lane but she's actually quoting a Robert Plant line by Led Zeppelin. I never thought that a film could be about something I lived myself, but here it is!"
Almost Famous (2000),An epic love story to 1970's rock and roll music and journalism.,"Almost Famous is the inspiring (mostly) true story of a 15 yo boy who starts working for Rolling Stone Magazine. Along the way, he tours with the fictional rock band, Stillwater and writes many reviews for them. Patrick Fujic, Jason Lee, Frances McDormand, and many other castmates all are at their very best in this film. Highly believable performances that shine like a diamond in the rock and roll skies! The mixture of comedy with some bits of ""angry drama"" also add into the mixture. There's many funny scenes, but also touching scenes of growing up and teenage adolescence and rebellion. Overall, just a great, great rocking film!"
Almost Famous (2000),Hanging out w narcissists the movie,"This movie is just some strange fantasy that pretends to be based on some story by someone long ago, usually a sign of fantasy only. It's kind of similar to Dazed and Confused type of thing about high school antics in a very cliched and dramatized way which likely either never happened or is so dramatized as to be similar to thinking real life is like a soap opera, not even close. I don't know how it gets so much cred as great because I don't see it at all, there's nothing powerful, no redeeming arc or great story to it. I get the soundtrack is great but a mixtape could do that on a road trip in a much more real way than this. Like most of what transformerwood does it's pushed on us and programmed by them through passive violence to be great. Cameron Crow, cc33, likely just has the juice and backing to get this done for him nothing more. Mass delusion and cult mentality of so many supposedly real reviews and numbers here are suspicious to say the least and I have serious doubts as to the shenanigans played here. Thus to get real reviews almost everything above a 6 is worthless drivel for the vast majority of this imagery industry offerings. The self promotion and awards of this industry doesn't make it real or great, it's just making up awards and convincing everyone gullible enough that there's some reality to it. Similar to those long titles that various orders give themselves to sound so great and important, well anyone can do that, just get enough cadres together to give it a reality of fantasy. And the main character, among others, is easily a transformer if you know what to look for."
Almost Famous (2000),Mostly terrible,"Took me all this time to see this. It just doesnt work. Although it's supposed to be about the music business and the travails of a certain band, we aren't given hint of their style of music, what their hit songs were or an insight into any of the band members. The few shots of them on stage look like they are playing in high school venues. The kid reporter doesn't seem to have a clue about anything. There's a scene when he's talking to Kate Hudon and they appear to be reading from different scripts. They talk past each other which doesnt matter because we have no idea what their relationship is
Terrible acting all around except for the late Hoffman who is the all wise and knowing mentor whose insights are extraneous to the plot, assuming there was one. ""I did some checking and all his notes are lies""
""The lead guitarist called and said it's all true.""
How's that for a twist? Better see That Thing You Do""."
Almost Famous (2000),Best ever,This movie is me it's my soul. I'm obsessed and can't stop. It's how i found my love for journalism and for that it'll always be with me. Penny Lane is my spirit animal she lives inside me. Forever grateful for this masterpiece that helped me find me. Please watch it at least once in your life time. I'm begging you do it. I often think about how if i never seen this i'd never would have found my true calling and probably would have a miserable major and miserable job. I can watch this movie forever and ever when i'm happy when i'm sad when i'm angry. I'll watch it whenever and still love it more and more.
Almost Famous (2000),The kind of film that sticks with you for life,"This is my favorite movie of all time. The music, sentimental moments, humor, romance, and raw price of being a celebrity (and just wanting to fit in in general)--it truly has it all. I love how Cameron took his experience from his teenage years with multiple bands and molded it into the infamous Stillwater. You can just tell this is all from real- life experience. (Although of course they had to slap on that copyright notice that these are all fictitious moments but if you've read anything about Crowe's life, you know it all happened) Nothing compares to those moments of the tour bus driving through those small towns of America, most namely the Tiny Dancer scene. This moment in cinema is STILL talked about 20+ years later, making it one of the most iconic movie scenes. That's not to forget the GOLDEN GOD, ""DON'T TAKE DR-GS"" and the plane scenes either. There's so many more, but watch it for yourself and you'll see what I mean."
Marry Me (2022),Not her best film. But still a good watch !!,"Marry Me is a 2022 American romantic film starring Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson. A math teacher holds a Marry Me sign at a concert. After learning that her on stage bridegroom has had affair. I have been wanting to watch this for such a long time and finally it comes to tv. Surprisingly it was a good watch. The storyline was good very different was little cheesy and predictable in places, but still enjoyable. The music makes the story stand out. I wouldn't say this is Jennifer Lopez best film I've seen her in but she is still a very talented lady and doesn't disappoint in her acting skills no doubt she is a better singer than a actress. There's no question about that. Owen Wilson is just on another level he is an incredible actor and can play any part and make it believable he just stood out in this movie in fact he is the one who shines In this. I enjoyed watching this and I'm glad I waited to watch this on New Year's Eve. So if you like Jennifer Lopez films and is a fan of her the you will like this. The music is the best bit. Sit back get the popcorn out and enjoy on your own or with friends a nice light up lifting film to watch. Streaming on Netflix and BBC I PLAYER as from New Year Eve."
Marry Me (2022),"Okay, it's cheesy.... but DAMN if it isn't adorable","Full disclosure, it's New Year's Day 2024 and I have had a few glasses of bubbly but I found the story simply lovely and uplifting. It does have a certain 'Hallmark' predictability but it more than redeems itself by the performances of JLO, Owen, Maluma and rest of the cast. Part concert video, part retelling of JLO's own past relationships, part positive message about following your heart despite what society expects, part revealing what celebs go through. Gotta admire JLO for 'going there', for the vocals, and for showing that the girl can ACT! The discomfort/repulsion she portrayed in a scene near the end... on the money. We've been there, we've done that, she captured it. It might be the bubbly speaking but we loved it. Some nice bits intermingled with the credits too."
Marry Me (2022),Ok so I'm only 2 minutes in and I'm horrifically cringing,Ok what thee actually frick. How the heck have Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson come to this... don't get me wrong I'm a hard core movie fan from Sci fi to action to thriller to art house..... and I secretly looove a cheesy romance splurge evey now and then.... but what the hell is this??? I am literally hiding under my duvet with cringeness and sooooooo embarrassed...... not just embarrassed cos I'm watching this but embarrassed for everyone involved in this shxt show...... cringe festarama.....turning it off now..... coz I literally can not stick with this awful awful film. Hey guys ..... jen n Owen get a grip n on yer career. Worst script choice EVER .. you are worth sooo much more.... no amount of money or glamour or glitz could have saved this sad sad effort of a movie. Sweet jeeeezuz what has the movie world come to .... are we really that desperate to live life in the public / social media that scripts have now been degraded to this.
Marry Me (2022),"No originally, completely predictable","I've always enjoyed films with Owen Wilson but this was quite a let down. If you can get over the awful music, autotune and lyrics which could have been written by a slow 5 year old it's just about watchable. The whole film was incredibly predictable and has been done a million times before, there are whole sections of the movie which you could cut out and you'd still be able to keep track. I honestly couldn't find a single ounce of originality in the whole movie. Side note: what's with her hair going from sling to a bob when her hair extensions are for the shorter bob? Did she get a haircut midway through the movie or something?"
Marry Me (2022),Poor writing.. Jennifer does her usual poor acting.. do not waste your time,Yet another poor boring love story .. 2 actors in their 50s are trying to present us a love/marriage story? Why ? Couldn't they find us a better cast ? Jennifer Lopes is at her best when it comes to terrible acting.. her singing performances in the film truly put me to sleep 😴. It's yet another attempt to keep her out there.. Owen Wilson's charm is completely lost in this poor flick.. its so stereotype that he's playing a teacher marrying a superstar who got betrayed. Do not waste your time because of the cast that might attempt. Boring boring film with very poor writing. Jennifer Lopes who should just stop doing films.. and possibly singing too..
Marry Me (2022),Good cast & rom-com,"In the world of cinema, there are moments when a promising premise, coupled with a star-studded cast, falls short of expectations. ""Love Unscripted,"" directed by acclaimed filmmaker Sarah Diaz, is one such movie that leaves viewers yearning for more despite its alluring cast. While it boasts an impressive lineup of talent, including music superstars Kat Valdez and Bastian, the film fails to capitalize on its potential, resulting in a mediocre cinematic experience. At the heart of ""Love Unscripted"" is a captivating idea: a globally broadcasted wedding between two music sensations, Kat Valdez (played by a charismatic A-list actress) and Bastian (portrayed by a talented heartthrob). This high-stakes setting promises intrigue, glamour, and the potential for intense emotions. However, the film takes an unexpected twist when Kat discovers Bastian's infidelity mere seconds before she is set to exchange vows. This plot twist propels Kat into the arms of a complete stranger, Charlie (played by a competent actor), whom she impulsively decides to marry. The film's standout feature undoubtedly lies in its ensemble cast. The lead actress, Kat Valdez, delivers a compelling performance, capturing the audience's sympathy with her vulnerability and charm. Her emotional journey throughout the movie is well-executed, and she manages to breathe life into an otherwise unremarkable storyline. Similarly, Bastian's portrayal by the heartthrob actor adds depth to his character, making viewers both despise and pity him as the story unfolds. It is a testament to the cast's talent that they manage to salvage the film from complete mediocrity. However, despite the exceptional cast, ""Love Unscripted"" suffers from a lackluster script that fails to do justice to the potential of its premise. The storyline feels contrived and riddled with clichés, with the impulsive marriage decision serving as the most glaring example. While the film attempts to convey a message about seizing the moment and following one's heart, it does so in a heavy-handed and unrealistic manner that leaves viewers questioning the characters' motivations and decisions. One of the film's major shortcomings is its inability to explore the complexities of relationships and human emotions in a meaningful way. The sudden switch from Bastian to Charlie as Kat's love interest lacks the necessary depth and development. This transition feels rushed and superficial, making it challenging for audiences to invest in the central romance. The film's supporting characters, who have the potential to provide depth and perspective, are underdeveloped and ultimately fail to contribute meaningfully to the narrative. Another drawback of ""Love Unscripted"" is its tendency to rely on predictable and formulaic plot devices. The film falls into the trap of using contrived obstacles and misunderstandings to drive the story forward, which feels artificial and undermines the potential for genuine emotional depth. The audience is left with a sense of déjà vu, as they have seen similar romantic conflicts and resolutions countless times before. Furthermore, the film's global broadcast wedding premise, which initially held great promise, is underutilized. The potential for exploring the pressures of fame, the impact of public scrutiny on personal relationships, and the role of media in shaping celebrity lives is barely scratched the surface. This missed opportunity to delve into the complexities of fame and love in the digital age is a significant disappointment. In conclusion, ""Love Unscripted"" is a mediocre movie elevated by its star-studded cast. While the lead actress and actor deliver commendable performances, the film ultimately fails to capitalize on its intriguing premise. The lackluster script, contrived plot devices, and underdeveloped characters prevent the movie from reaching its full potential. Despite moments of charm and occasional glimpses of emotional resonance, ""Love Unscripted"" remains a forgettable addition to the romantic comedy genre. Fans of the lead cast may find some enjoyment in their performances, but for those seeking a truly compelling and thought-provoking cinematic experience, this film falls short of the mark."
Marry Me (2022),One of the best movies I've seen this year,"I really can't believe I didn't see this movie in the theater. My wife and I sat and watched this movie at home and laughed and cried through a lot of it. The music is great but that is consistent with a JLo movie, and Wilson played the usual out of sorts 'Guy Next Door' as a single dad with a normal job. Lopez' found that spending time with this guy normalized her life which apparently she needed to elevate her to the next steps of her career. There a few corner scenes that make the movie well suited for the entire family, and the closing scenes in which Lopez appears at the airport and people are scrambling to take pics, the scene on the flight in which she's sitting in a middle seat in coach in a dress so uncomfortable you have to laugh."
Marry Me (2022),Didn't think it would be that nice,"I was really surprised how ""feel good"" this movie turned out to be. I had no expectations at all. Just sat down and watched the movie. There are a few good messages in the film. Its a little like you know what will happen, but the movie was very entertaining and had some good comedy in it. Both Owen and Jennifer were excellent as usual. I would recommend this movie to anyone who feels like they need a lift emotionally. Its just a very nice, easy to watch, rom com. Even the rest of the cast were fine. The movie did NOT focus on them more than it should and stuck with the main story of the main characters relationship."
Marry Me (2022),Have I wasted my Valentine's date on this movie?,"I've always loved J. Lo's movies Unrealistic love stories with a couple of obstacles to jump through and a promised happy ending at the end. This movie started out very promising, with two of Hollywood's veteran sweethearts, but unfortunately their chemistry just wasn't there. The story line fell apart and dragged out from time to time. The songs written for the movie felt rushed and basic, though J. Lo does them credit by performing. Have I wasted my Valentine's date on this movie? No, it did make me smile couple of times and even though this is not at all the best J. Lo movie out there it was worth a watch."
Marry Me (2022),Watch Me,"This film is adorable. Lopez and Wilson are charming and superbly watchable in this romance that hits all the right notes. This is so much better than most of the so-called romance movies available on the streamers. I'm loving the older, battle-hardened protagonists we're getting with Lopez. She deserves quality and she's finally getting it, even when they're dressed up in stilettos, sequins and hair pieces. I think I particularly liked this one because it takes the tried and tested tropes of fake husband, opposites attract and forced proximity and gives us something that is both escapist and relatable. It's hard to get right, but I think they got it right here."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),My rating is lower because I would have preferred the film without musical numbers,"A fun little Christmas film and one of the many adaptations of this classic literature story, as a Muppets version. On a recent viewing, I fast forwarded through the musical numbers and I'm sure I mentally checked out of the film watching those scenes even as a kid. The musical numbers are meant to appeal to a more family audience but in reality it's a nuisance to watch and listen to lol. Michael Caine gives a superb performance as the miserly Scrooge, he's very well cast in this role. A must-watch Christmas film, just skip through the musical numbers because they add nothing to the storytelling."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),Charming love letter to Jim,"Muppet Christmas Carol The most faithful adaptation of the story is also the silliest version I have ever seen. The movie was the first made after Jim Henson's untimely death, so it had a lot riding on it to see how the franchise would continue. It took me nearly 3 decades to get myself to watch it because I still hadn't gotten over his death. I mention this because it affected my perception of the film. I first saw it in 2020 when I was going through some tough times. A close friend of mine had it on his ""must see at Christmas"" list every year so I finally agreed to watch it. I was immediately taken back to those days and months after Mr. Henson's passing, when I was only 13. But this time, instead of denial, I saw a charming love letter to the man who helped shape my childhood. I couldn't have been happier to see that his legacy lived on. Now, moving on to the movie itself, I found it to be cleverly scripted, brilliantly acted by both the human performers, and the muppet performers, and enhanced by some very catchy and meaningful songs. The story is told in the familiar fashion that most people know but with moments of absurdity and silliness that help lighten the mood, but still highlight one troubled man's path toward redemption. It is often forgotten that one cannot define a person by their actions alone. Scrooge's nephew continues to speak of the good that must be bubbling beneath the surface. As the past and present spirits reveal the true reasons behind his misery and foul demeanor, the viewer may change their thoughts on the man. Redemption is potentially possible once the pain is revealed and set free. In this situation, I am happy to see the change in him. It's a cute movie with muppets, but it tells the story well, and I feel it is a fair movie to watch with children. Open discussion on the themes can be helpful in reminding them that what's on the surface may be hiding a pain that one knows nothing about. Be kind to one another. And Merry Christmas."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),Grown but good,"This film was an obsession for me in 1993. The music sticks in my head like no other, thank you Paul Williams. Michael Cane plays Scrooge with such seriousness that you forget that half of the cast are felt puppets. Great way of utilizing Gonzo as Dickens. Also if you go to the extras on Disney +it has the deleted song that made people too sad apparently. No, children need to be sad and know heart break. Let them grow. Thus was the first film I believe after Jim Henson's passing, but they made it count and work. I do love how the Muppets break the fourth wall when they can, but not make it too sappy at the same time,"
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),I think I have aged. I am totally on Scrooge's side.,"Stop villainizing Scoooooge. (Just kidding.) It's funny I now totally get Scrooge. Fred is such a hypocrite. Smiling and delivering words of God on Christmas day but slandering Scrooge behind his back. He is a hopeless optimist without realistic plans but counting on his uncle. He benefits from Scrooge's hard work and gains people's favor just by standing opposite of him. Scrooge yells at his employees, and it's wrong conduct. However, employees are annoyingly loud. Charity workers should not force donations and judge people who do not give money. He's rich, and paying the large amount of tax without committing crimes to evade tax is the most primal responsibility as he said. Soundtracks are surprisingly amazing. However, it's still a kids movie when it comes to the quality of the film."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),The best Christmas Carol adaption out there!,"This one just absolutely tops all other versions! Even after years and years of rewatching this movie, it hits me in all the feels every time. The songs, the characters, the portrayals are all done spectacularly for a seemingly low-budget film. Exceptional performance from Michael Caine, as usual, cementing him as the best actor of Scrooge. The story follows practically the same as the original, but it adds that Muppet charm and humor that makes it feel completely original. The crossover of Muppets and humans feels natural and welcoming, making the world feel colorful and magical. Overall, this definitely is the best rendition of this Christmas classic and will remain so for a long, long time!"
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.0
Overall, it's The Muppets telling 'A Christmas Carol' (with some pretty good musical numbers). Pretty Good Direction (The direction of a macroscale feels very polished for a Muppets movie as the use of cinematography and the execution of musical numbers is good; the direction on a microscale is pretty standard; the direction of actors and voice actors is pretty similar to other Muppets movies; the storytelling is very similar to other retellings of A Christmas Carol (but with a Muppets twist)), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Michael Caine (I have no idea what he's doing in this movie but he does a pretty good job in both being Scrooge and singing), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Pretty good singing and the puppeteering and voice acting is similar to other Muppets movies)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The concept is just the Muppets telling 'A Christmas Carol'; the story construction just follows 'A Christmas Carol'; the flow between sequences is very meta/interjected a lot to talk to the audience (very typical of other Muppets movies); the character writing is just portraying the Muppets and Scrooge), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is just 'A Christmas Carol' mixed with Muppets-esque dialogue; the humor is very Muppets-esque; the symbolism is just the symbolism of 'A Christmas Carol'; The foreshadowing is just the foreshadowing of 'A Christmas Carol'), Pretty Good Score (Used pretty well to set the tone)/ Pretty Good Soundtrack (The musical numbers were pretty good and pretty funny), Good Cinematography (Very polished and used well), Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing (Very Polished), Good Visual Effects (The use of puppeteering was really good as it showed the experience of The Muppets, the use of green screen was pretty obvious), Good Costumes (Helped set the scene for 'A Christmas Carol'), Plot Structure followed the Christmas Carol template (but done well), Pacing was pretty fast (there isn't that much plot to go through and the runtime is pretty short), Climax was executed pretty well and brought everything together, Tone was a mix of 'A Christmas Carol' with The Muppets."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),A Muppet Christmas Classic,"For over ten years, (I don't know why) every year when Christmas comes along. I always watch a different version of A Christmas Carol. Out of all the versions I have seen, my personal favourites are Scrooge (1951) staring Alastair Sims and Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). But the version staring the Muppets is brilliant, accurate but thanks to the muppets also keeps it funny. What I like about this version is that is that it's not as ""dark, moody and scary"" as the other versions. It's the humour that keeps that in check. Don't misunderstand, when it comes to the scenes of Christmas yet to come. That part would scare kids, but there is a message behind that. Because the future hasn't been written yet, people can make changes to the future to make not only there future bright, but other people as well, especially during the festive season. Although I don't know much about Charles Dickens, this is one story i can relate to. For those who are unaware, there is a museum dedicated to him in London, UK. Trust me, its worth visiting it, especially at this time of year."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),The best Christmas Carol movie.,"My wife and I agree that this is the best Christmas Carol version. We've watched nearly all of them. Only Scrooged is in competition with it in my opinion, but that differs quite a bit from the original. The muppets are great, Michael Caine is great, the effects are great. I'm not sure I can think of an actor who could do a better job. Kermit is a perfect fit to play Scrooge's mistreated assistant, since we're used to seeing him play a similar role with Miss Piggy. Just watched this recently and it's surprisingly well done for a first time director. Looking forward to watching it in the future so that I can start to memorize the songs."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),it may be the best Muppet movie - it's definitely not the best Christmas Carol,"I have a very soft spot for Muppet CC - fond memories of going to see it on a snowy day in Manchester - but objectively it's not one of the better adaptations of Dickens' immortal tale. I generally watch it at some point over Christmas, and I think if anything familiarity has obscured the fact that it is just not a very good idea. The incorporation of existing Muppet characters into the story has only limited success, and sometimes the attempt is jarring. The use of Gonzo to link it, with Rizzo the rat (not previously an important character), is downright awkward. The landscapes look more like America than Britain, and some of the accents are distinctly hokey. Paul Williams' numbers are not the strongest, and even Scrooge himself, Michael Caine, doesn't compare well to the many great previous performances. Caine is okay as long as he can underplay - when he tries to emote, it's not a good look. But it is fun, certainly a helluva lot better than Muppet Treasure Island. Miss Piggy, with her lookalike and actalike daughters Bettina and Belinda, is fantastic. For what it's worth, I think the best Muppets film is the revival one with Jason Segel."
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992),I like this...and I'm not a Muppets fan,"I enjoy this. It's saved by its soul, its songs and by Michael Caine as Scrooge. I don't enjoy the Muppets or quite understand why people are so fanatically in love with them. I grew up on Sesame Street and still don't love the Muppets. Most of the time, the Muppets are just goofy ridiculousness. I have a sense of humor, but I don't love the puppetry and characters. I do love Dickens' tale, and I believe Henson did well here with it. Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge is award-worthy. I'll watch this again, and that surprises me. I figured I'd only want to watch this once and be done with it. And that says everything to me."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Wonderful Adaptation of a Fun Story,"This was a movie that my sister and I grew up with. It is one that we'd watch in a steady rotation. I'll be honest though; this was a movie that I hadn't seen in probably 25 or so years. Jaime and I wanted to revisit this one after having seen the prequel of Wonka. We wanted to see how well it could fit in story-wise. Then for this adaptation of the source material, we are following Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum). He is a poor boy who lives with his mother, Mrs. Bucket (Diana Sowle), her parents who include Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), as well as her deceased husband's parents. All the grandparents are confined to one bed. Mrs. Bucket works in a laundry where Charlie has picked up a job delivering newspapers. In the area, there is the infamous Wonka Chocolate Factory. It has been sealed up for some time. All that comes out would be the products that are made there. Things change though when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) hosts a contest, offering a lifetime supply of chocolate to the winners. There are five golden tickets hidden in the wrapper of chocolate bars. This brings Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner), Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson) and Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) to the factory along with one guardian. Charlie is also the improbable last guest with his grandfather. It is inside that they all get a taste of the madness of Wonka and his crew that help him produce his candy. They are a strange race known as Oompa Loompas. The kids are told not to do it and when they go against what Wonka said, we see what the repercussions are. Wonka isn't fully letting on what his plan is and it will take a true act of kindness to succeed. What I'm going to say to lead off here is that this is a fun movie. Wilder is perfectly cast in this eccentric role of Wonka. He adds snark and sarcasm to the role that make me laugh. It is funny that Jaime looked at me multiple times while watching this to say that is something I'd say. Something interesting is that Wonka is supposed to be a jovial person. I get part of that here, but he also seems tired and just over the world as well. It makes sense in the end as well. This version of the story is a fantastical story and place that still feels grounded in the real world. Things seen inside of this factory don't make sense to the visitors, but to Wonka, it is normal. I do love that as it is a tough line to walk. It does a great job at capturing the heart of Roald Dahl's novel and bringing it to life. I'll be honest though, I had this read to me when I was in fourth grade, but I don't remember a lot of the book for obvious reasons. It is impressive that this is done at a time of practical effects as well. That adds charm to it. What also makes this work is the acting. I've said how good Wilder is. It is interesting that with the new one out, Timothée Chalamet feels like the younger version to me. Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe, a character that is problematic while still being beloved. I thought that Ostrum was good as Charlie. He has the best heart and intentions of the golden ticket winners. Cole, Nickerson, Themmen and Bollner are good as the other kids who have character flaws that explain why they fall victim to different things in the factory. Roy Kinnear, Leonard Stone, Nora Denney and Ursula Reit are all good as well as the parents who should shoulder blame. All the Oompa Loompas are great and the rest of the cast push our characters to where they end up. I'll then end this out saying that this is a classic. It is a funny movie. There are good messages here that have a different feeling now that I'm a parent. The acting is good. This is a well made movie. Extra credit there to make this fantastic place come to life in what feels like a real world. This captures that the best. Effects are good as are the different songs that we hear. That is something else, this is a well made musical as well. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it in awhile as this is just great. My Rating: 9 out of 10."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Happy chocolate movie,"After saw the Fabulous "" Charlie and the Chocolate Factory "" by the greatest Tim Burton who did all my childhood with his own movie of chocolate, I was so excited to see the first opus of the chocolate factory and I was absolutely not disappointed ! Obviously It can be better than burton's movie cause the budgets are not the same but we feel too a good chocolate environment and well of course childhood ambiant !!! But I was little surprised by the fact that this movie was about the same story that Burton's movie, I wanted a new story about that but is more Burton was be inspired by this movie that is own I will prefer two different story ! Finally good and not bad movie and better to see as a child for have the magic :))))))"

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Pure Creativity,"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is as creative a film as it gets. It is weird, it is fun, it is everything a movie should be. Pure Imagination perfectly sums up this film and its chocolate factory. This movie as well as Gene Wilder's performance, as the eccentric Willy Wonka will live on forever. It will be watched by both kids and adults of all ages and everyone will find something to enjoy. This is an undisputed classic with an excellent set-design, wonderful music and terrific performances by the entire cast.

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),If you want to view paradise simply go and watch this movie,"This is an amazing classic film and it was my favorite when I was six and seven. Charlie and the chocolate factory was the first chapter book I ever read. This movie may not have a lot of stuff from the book but it still holds to be great. I'm 12 and I still love this movie for what it is. The only downside in my opinion is the title given that the film title is different than the book title. Gene Wilder is absolutely magical and his performance is perfect. It's funny, smart, and surprisingly well shot for a 70s movie. The other actors do great and the oompa loompas are something else. The oompa loompas are my absolute favorite part of the movie and that song they sing hits different. The oompa loompa song while it's not in the book it's amazing. Parents there is nothing to say that's inappropriate or violent about this movie. Slugworth may seem a little creepy but it's not that bad. This is a 70s masterpiece and a HUGE part of my childhood. 7/10."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),A mouth-watering classic for all ages.,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless classic, known amongst generations for it's charm, family entertainment, and spectacular performance of Willy Wonka, provided by the late, great Gene Wilder. Directed by Mel Stuart, and produced by David L. Wolper, this film is based upon the 1964 children's classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" written by world renowned author, Roald Dahl. The story follows Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum), a boy who is down on his luck and who's family is impoverished. Still, he is as happy as any kid can be, and his family is really close, something that the audience loves to see. Particularly, he is close with his mother (Diana Mae Sowel), and his bed-ridden, yet sharp, grandfather, Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). After a fateful announcement that Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), a magician in the candy making world, was opening his factory to 5 lucky children who happened to find Golden Tickets, it would seem that Charlie's hopes were about to come true. The first four tickets are found, or given in one case, to some children who seem to be... crude or mean. After a false ticket finding, Charlie finds the fifth Golden Ticket and is whisked away to a world of splendor, one not known to man. On the first day of October, at 10 in the morning, Charlie Bucket, his grandfather, and the other ticket winners are led into the almost ethereal universe that is Willy Wonka's factory. Along the way, four of the five ticket winners meet their memorable, and very ironic, early tour ends and Charlie is left at the end, seemingly to win the entire contest... until Willy Wonka yells at him and his grandfather for ""breaking the rules"". This confuses and upsets Charlie and Grandpa Joe, with the latter threatening to get even with Wonka by selling the boy's Everlasting Gobstopper to an enemy confectioner, but Charlie does the right thing and give the treat back, prompting Wonka to say ""So shines a good deed in a weary world"". The candy man turns around one last time and says that Charlie has won, leading him and Grandpa Joe into the ""Great Glass Wonkavator"", which he uses to bust out of the roof of the factory in one last surprise, giving Charlie the entire factory as his grand prize... ""Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he's always wanted... he lived happily every after."" So this film, released in 1971, has gone down in history as one of the greatest family films of all time, and it has earned that title graciously. Though some aspects of the film have not aged the best, including the centerpiece of the Chocolate Room, the river, the movie is still visually pleasing and eye candy to look at, no pun intended. The colors are bright and vivid, and it easily helps the viewer to believe in this fantastical world. The songs, as well, are memorable and fun to sing with. From the minds of Anthony Newly and Leslie Bricuse comes the wonderful and iconic soundtrack, with such numbers as ""The Candy Man"", ""I've Got a Golden Ticket"" and ""Pure Imagination"", to name a few, each song as timeless as the movie itself. Overall, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a fantastic watch for any family with its great music, funny dialogue, and engrossing visuals. The morals that can be derived are good ones for children to learn, as well. This film is a must watch for any family, and will forever go down in history as one of the greatest works of cinema of all time."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Classic!,"I watched this before ""Wonka"" and it still holds up! What surprised me about this movie was how great it is even before they get into the factory! It's well setup with introducing the characters, (enough that we clearly who they all are) the hunt for the golden tickets is surprisingly exciting (and fairly realistic to what I would imagine it would be like if a company did something like it) and creating intrigue around the Willy wonka character. Charlie is setup well too as he leaves you sympathetic towards him with his situation with his family, so you root for him. When they do make it to the factory it is fun! It is magical while becoming just the right amount of disturbing and darkly comedic. (I do think the rotten kids survived by the way. Wonka says as much in one scene. I do enjoy the uncertainly of it though)
How could I not mention Wonka himself. Just his introduction might be one of the great character introductions that perfectly shows from the beginning you can not always predict what is going on with this guy. His sardonic witty personality adds much to it too! (That's where the late Gene Wilder was a perfect fit for the character). My few criticisms of the film are I don't really care for the floating to the fan scene with grandpa Joe and Charlie. I feel like if you're trying to establish that Charlie is the good obedient kid that scene does the opposite. To be fair Grandpa Joe was influencing him and maybe it was to show that Charlie isn't perfect (the problem ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" has) If Charlie hadn't gotten down from the fan he would not have been any different than the other kids. And them getting down by burping seemed a bit juvenile in an otherwise smart movie. Second, while Charlie is well setup as a character from the beginning I do wish we learned more about why he desired the golden ticket so badly. (Especially when it's more clearer with the other kids, wanting the golden ticket for selfish reasons). Grandpa Joe says it's Charlie's dream but I feel we do not really see that much with Charlie. (Besides some scenes of disappointment when he doesn't get the ticket the first couple of times). And the last couple Oppa Loopa songs are a little forced (like we get the message you don't have to sing it to us!) The rest of their songs are catchy though and that goes for the rest of the soundtrack too! This is also a musical and the songs are very memorable! (I just watched it and I already have some of the songs in my head!) And there are some quoteable quotes by the end which is always a plus for me! Besides my few qualms with it this is overall a timeless classic and will be for years to come!"
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Pretty good,"Very good kinda? This movie is a classic the acting isn't awful, it's not the best but it's definitely passable. The music is very hit or miss but the songs definitely have their moments. The set design is easily what makes this film so famous. It really captures the beauty and charm of Roal dahls imagination. The world feels very creative and anyone would want to see it themselves. The movie also has weirdly scary imagery and I don't know why and I'm not even 100% sure if it's done on purpose, but it's definitely their. The comedy is also astounding in this film. Gene wilder is amazing in this film he's similar in a way to bill murray in the first ghostbusters, just much more subtle with it. Finally, I think the story isn't the best. There's a lot of obvious plot holes that kinda ruin it and even when you look behind that, all the characters are very 2 dimensional even the star Charlie. (Also due to weird plot choices half the casts choices make them seem like sociopaths)."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),Not just for sweet tooth(s),"No pun intended - I was able to watch the new Wonka movie, which is supposed to be the backstory or the prequel to this and/or the Johnny Depp movie. I have to admit, I really liked what they did with the new movie! There was a lot of intelligent dialog (and songs - and I don't like musicals in general ... well that is what I thought to say the least) and a lot of fantasy and great set design (costumes and everything else included). But back to this (no pun intended either), a movie that I assume many have a weak spot for! Especially if they have seen it as kids. And while it does seem to have quite a few adult themes in there (and can feel gruesome I reckon), it is fun to watch with quite the great performance by Wilder! The new movie (prequel) is taking a few things that you may know from this - like the Oompa Loompa (song) to name just one thing. The beginning of this movie right here is a bit ... well bumpy. At least it felt weird to say the least - I understand that the movie needs to get the kids and introduce them to the audience ... but it feels badly aged in trying to be ... well funny and savvy and critical (consumerism and so forth). If you don't mind the sometimes grim methods and can dig the humor of the movie (also dark at times), you will like it. How conceivable everything is? Well suspension of disbelief and all that ... chocolate is the name of the game, but being good and righteous is what really helps you move along or rather forward."
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971),"So, Wonka is a psychopath?","The very best part of this movie is Gene Wilder's WIlly Wonka. He is absolutely crazy, unhinged and charming at the same time, which is how real psychopaths are. Now from what I remember from the Johnny Depp version, he portrayed the character as an awkward, bumbling genius kind of guy, that may be more like how movies portray psychopaths? So either way, it seems the consensus is that Willy Wonka is a psychopath. Other than that, the movie was a delight to watch filled with childlike wonder, sometimes scary, sometimes wild. A not-so-subtle implication of supporting slavery while criticizing capitalism but with no regard for the government. But I'm gonna take things here more at face value considering the nature of the film and the time it came out. The new Wonka trailer does seem to be more closer to this than the remake."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Killing a Wonka legacy,"This movie is a massacre of the legacy of the original. It's dark, with no hope. It's horrendous. The only beauty is the new Wonka movie is magic. Enjoy it. Enjoy it knowing Tim Burton didn't make it! The Burton movie was dark and more in the style of Edward Scissorhands than the Gene Wilder version. It's morbid and Depp is almost freakiest as Wonka instead of having a childish charm. I'm apathetic to the book as it's from the 1960s and we've all grown up a bit since then so any movie doesn't have to be perfect. But this one misses the mark. I am a massive Wonka fan. I love the Wilder adaptation. He brings character and empathy, something Depp lacks in this monstrosity."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Only great if you saw this as a child,"I haven't watched the original film in quite some time, so I don't really know how this one stacks up against it. However, I can say that I did not really enjoy this one, and I thought that I had never seen it before, but I realized in the middle of watching it that yes indeed I have seen it before. Johnny Depp gives his best in personation of Michael Jackson in the height of his wacko Jacko era, and while this does provide a few Chuckles, it just makes the movie weird and not in a fun way. He's not the biggest problem with the movie though, as the biggest problem is Tim Burton's brand of weirdness. I like Tim Burton when the weirdness comes naturally and not when they have hired Tim Burton to be weird. It's kind of like the difference between Edward Scissorhands and that horrible Alice in Wonderland movie. So there's a few good lines in this movie, but I have heard that the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie is much better, so either watch the original or that one."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Ignore the negative reviews,"I've watched this film when I was a child and since I literally forgot the whole plot I decided to watch it again and I'm actually suprised by how much I liked it like in my memories it wasn't that good. I would say ignore the negative reviews reagrdless if the film is truely accurate to the book or not. I mean maybe it doesn't respect certain aspects of the book but that doesn't invalidate the film. I really enjoyed it actually and I found it genuine, heartwarming and funny. I also love Johnny Depp's comedic portrayal of Willy Wonka. He definetly carried the film. And a big shoutout to the kids in the film too. Overall a great film that I would recommend."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),30. december 2023,"Average rating: 6.8 Genre:
 Family Adventure Musical A decent financial success. The film is based on a novel of the same name written by Roald Dahl in 1964. Tim Burton works his magic on the screen, resulting in a colorful whirlwind inside the chocolate factory. Tim Burton avoided using too many digital effects because he wanted the younger actors to have a realistic environment to move in and play against. Therefore, considerable effort was put into oversized props, various perspective techniques, and models. Details were carefully considered, such as the style in which the Oompa-Loompas sing, among other things. However, there is a slight lack in terms of the technical aspect and the knowledge that Mike Teavee possesses, as it is not entirely factually correct. Critics might argue that the film doesn't have the clear jumps that a Tim Burton film should, but becomes too compressed in its settings and locations. I find the film psychedelic in various ways, from the entire plot to the colors and concept. It's silly, really, that Willy Wonka almost randomly chooses an heir from 5 random children. Well, the film is worth watching."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Good!,"I love this adaptation of the beloved Roald Dahl book! Many people think it is a remake of the original Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory but it's is not. They made it more loyal to the books as well. So it doesn't have much of a colorful atmosphere. It is dark and crazy just like the book. It may be scary for a younger audience though. To be honest, I prefer this over the first one. And I'm glad that Tim Burton created such a wonderful adaptation of the book. It may be too scary for young kids. It is pretty dark and scary. If you're child is interested make sure you look at the parents guide. Thanks for reading!"
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),"If you love chocolate, then you should definitely watch that movie!","First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda innovative, because there aren't any other movies similar to this one. The storyline was well-written, very well-explained and easy to understand. The characters were interesting, well-developed and likeable (except, the four spoiled children). The filming location of the movie was mainly inside Willy's chocolate factory. The casting was nice and their acting was really good, Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was excellent. I have to admit, it wasn't an intense movie and there weren't any shocking moments. However, it was very funny and there were too many hilarious scenes. The opening scene was kinda predictable, fast-paced and promising. The ending scene was definitely predictable and I liked it. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both amazing. Overall, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was an enjoyable family film, colorful, funny and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Is this sweeter than the original,"Take Roald Dahl, add Tim Burton and sprinkle with Johnny Depp. Roald Dahl was well known for his dark stories and dark undercurrents in his more light hearted works. In comparison to the Gene Wilder original this was going to be less candyfloss sweetness than the rightly celebrated 1971 movie. Tim Burton has added his touches to this classic childrens story. He presents Willy Wonka with a palour that hints at somethnig more menancing under the top hat. Johnny Depp's Will Wonka has more of the Peter Pan, the boy that never grew up, whereas Gene Wilder's was an adult. In remaking classic movies, a new cinnamon twist is needed. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have found an interpretation that is distinct from the 1971 movie and is more faithful to Dahl's novel. Recommended watching and then watch the original."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),this is good but the original is better,"I have always loved this movie and have watch it since I was a kid, I have also watched the original one multiple times as a kid but now the movie is trending and it is getting kinda annoying this movie has always been one of my favorites and I hate how the fan base is ruining it I can see that Tim Burton tried to follow the book more than the original movie but I can see absolutely no reason in any way to say this movie is any better than the original. People have said that Johnny drop is the best Willy wonka there is but in my opinion he is one of my favorite actors but the worst wonka there is I can see that Tim Burton had tried to make him funnier In this one and yes he was so funny in this movie but. Gene wilder was a much better Willy wonka."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),Unique Remake of a Classic,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the remake of the 1971 classic, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This film has a tremendously different tone than the first film, but I like that it has its own identity. Johnny Depp truly is phenomenal as Willy Wonka as his performance is unlike anything he has ever done before. The film definitely has a very Tim Burton feel and I enjoyed that because the whole Chocolate Factory and the person that is Willy Wonka is mysterious and somewhat of an enigma. Some will not enjoy the change of tone from the original film and that is fine, but I suggest viewing this film with an open mind. It is a different take from the original film for sure, but a successful remake of the Roald Dahl tale nonetheless."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),A Whimsical and Delicious Adventure,"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" takes viewers on a delightful journey into the enchanting world of Willy Wonka's renowned chocolate factory.

The Wizard of Oz (1939),There's no place like home,"Every time I write about a musical (which is not often) I say this: I really don't care about them and neither do a bunch of other film fans. However, this movie is arguably the most famous one ever made so I am going to make an exception here. The Wizard of Oz was originally a kid's book from 1900, but is today mostly remembered as this beyond legendary movie which has its monumental reputation for a number of reasons. It utilized Technicolor at a time when few other films did in order to take full advantage of the grandiose fantasy setting, it had original and memorable characters, morals, and an unforgettable adventure. I don't think there's any person on Earth who hasn't seen this at least once, so explaining the plot might seem like an exercise in futility, but it's one of the greatest stories ever told. The movie begins with a rural teenage girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) living on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt and Uncle. Dorothy's terrier, Toto, bites a rich woman named Almira, which leads to the latter wanting the dog to be put down. Toto is confiscated by Almira, but makes it back to Dorothy, and they run off together to escape Almira's wrath. Dorothy intends on running away, but meets a fraudulent fortune teller who tells Dorothy her aunt is sick and she must go home to her right away. She arrives back home just as a big tornado is about to demolish her house. She takes shelter in the house and is knocked out by violent winds as the tornado transports the house to what seems like another dimension. Dorothy wakes up in what is called Munchkinland which is part of the land of Oz. Tiny people (known as munchkins) are happy Dorothy's house is here as it just so happened to land on an evil witch named the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. The witch's sibling, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), appears out of thin air in order to take back a pair of shiny ruby slippers which belonged to her sister. However, a benevolent witch named Glinda uses her magic to make Dorothy wear them. The Wicked Witch can't use her powers in a happy land like Munchkinland, so she is forced to leave, but tells Dorothy next time she won't be so lucky. Glinda instructs Dorothy to follow what is known as the Yellow Brick Road which leads into Emerald City, home to the Wizard of Oz and the person who will know how she can get back home. On the way there, Dorothy meets other outlandish characters, namely a Scarecrow, a metal man known as Tin Man, and a humanoid lion called The Cowardly Lion (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively). As each one meets Dorothy, they agree to accompany her on her journey, as each of them wants to ask the Wizard for something they believe is important to them. The Tin Man wants a heart so he can feel human emotions, the Lion wants courage so he can stop being afraid, and the Scarecrow wants a brain. Upon reaching Emerald City, Dorothy is let in, but only after mentioning Glinda sent them. They meet with the Wizard, who says who will grant their wishes, but only if they're able to get the Wicked Witch's broomstick. Dorothy and her friends set out to infiltrate the Witch's secret fortress, but the Witch orders flying monkey servants she owns to capture Dorothy and Toto. The Witch locks Dorothy in a room of the castle and says if she doesn't give up the slippers, she will kill her dog. Toto manages to run off and alert Tin Man, The Lion and Scarecrow to Dorothy's trouble. The three disguise themselves as the Witch's soldiers and get into the castle. Tin Man uses his axe to break down the door Dorothy is locked behind, and they attempt to escape. They don't get very far before the huge swarms of soldiers surround them. The Wicked Witch sets her broom on fire and torches Scarecrow with it, leading Dorothy to extinguish him with a bucket of water. Some of the water gets onto the witch, who proceeds to melt and die. Dorothy says she didn't mean to kill her, but the Witch's own soldiers are glad she is finished and want Dorothy to take the broom to the Wizard. Arriving back in Oz's chamber, Dorothy presents him with the broom, but the Wizard doesn't uphold his end of the deal. He says to come back tomorrow. Toto pulls back a curtain in the corner of the chamber, revealing the Wizard to be nothing more than an ordinary guy operating a machine that projects a big, transparent image of his face. Angry at first for being lied to, Dorothy confronts the Wizard, but he grants the wishes of Tin Man, The Lion, and Scarecrow by giving them things that represent the traits they always wanted. The Lion gets a medal symbolizing his bravery, Tin Man gets a heart with a clock inside it, and Scarecrow is given a PhD. The Wizard then offers to fly Dorothy back to Kansas in a hot air balloon, but right before setting off, Toto jumps from the basket and Dorothy must run after him. She is left behind. Now depressed that she'll never get back home, Dorothy sees an orb of light approaching, which contains Glinda. The good witch says Dorothy had the ability to return to Kansas the whole time, but had to find that out for herself. All she has to do is tap her heels together with her eyes closed and say ""there's no place like home."" After saying bye to her friends, she does this and wakes up in her bed, her Aunt and Uncle standing nearby. The farm hands who work for her Aunt look exactly like her three friends from Oz, but they are convinced it was just a dream. This entire film from start to end is just pure magic. I might be wrong, but I really think it is the overall the most famous movie ever. Everything about it is basically perfect, and there's many reasons why it has stood the test of time for almost a century. The landscapes of Oz are just wondrous, and everything is so colorful it looks like you can reach out and touch it. Garland's portrayal of Dorothy is a masterpiece. While this film may basically define the word classic and is what most people think of when they imagine the golden age of movies, it would be nothing without her contributions. She doesn't pretend to be a hero on her quest, and only wants to see her family again. She doesn't even want revenge on the witch trying to sabotage her at every turn. She is in a big hurry to run away in the beginning for the safety of her dog, but by the end, she realizes home is the place where they're most safe. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch is great. She's menacing, and even though most people think of this as a kid's film, she is genuinely so good and creepy in her role that you can't take your eyes off her. She and the other characters have no doubt left permanent impressions on film fans for decades, and will continue to do so. As long as movies are a thing, I'm very confident that The Wizard of Oz will keep on being watched, praised and written about for generations. It is hard for me to say if this or Gone With the Wind is the all time iconic American movie, but it's so hard to choose between two masterpieces."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),The Wizard of Oz,"The Wizard of Oz what can I say about this Film. It was made in 1939 that is 85 Years ago. It had hundreds of tiny people in the Film that can sing and dance. The girl has to get home to her grandma and grandpa. Who is helping her a Scarecrow, Lion, and a Tinman. And her little dog as well. But must be careful of the mean and crazy witch because she wants her magic shoes she is wearing. It was so cool how they all can sing and dance together. Also bake 85 Years when she wakes up into that Land with the tiny people and the mean witch. Scarecrow, Lion and Tinman as she opened the door to her home. The Film went from black and white to full color film. It kind of blew you away. Because the very beginning seems to be a little boring. Then it got crazy in the other land she went to after the really bad storm."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),10/10,"Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?"" - Glinda Following a lage tornado, Dorothy, a teenage farm girl from Kansas, is swept away to the magical land of Oz. Along with her new friends the Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion, Dorothy must find the Wizard in the hopes he can help her return home. I can't remember when or where I saw Wizard of Oz for the first time. It's one of those films ingrained in my memory since as long as I can remember and although not one of my favourite films of all time - its still a near perfect movie! The transition from Black and White to Colour is just as striking now as I'm sure it would of been back in 1939. Even though I know what to expect, it still takes me by surprise every time she steps into Munckin City. The performances, songs and dance numbers are extremely zany, catchy and camp but it blends in well with the ridiculousness of the film itself. The actors were well selected and every main character plays there part extremely well - the munchkins are a little flat I have to say but their songs and costumes make up for the lack of acting skills. The 4K image is crystal clear and the downside to that is certain special effects are extremely noticable and not always effectuve - such as the visible trap door when the Wicked Witch appears/disappears in the Munckim City or when the Wicked Witch flies on her broom around the castle and you can tell it's a small toy on a string or wire. Even though I did laugh at these on my recent watch through, i also appreciated the skill and effort it took to achieve such special effects in 1939 - and it would of looked perfectly realistic on CRT TV, VHS and DVD... Final Verdict:
This movie is a classic and a much loved family favourite for many generations. The songs are catchy, the story timeless and the performances are memorable. In 4K the image is so clear and vibrant you'd think the film was made this century!"
The Wizard of Oz (1939),Still captures the attention of viewers today with its cinematic magic,"Is there a movie that has permeated pop culture so much and for so long than The Wizard of Oz? Even though this film was released in 1939, it still captures the attention of viewers today with its cinematic magic. It's a story for all ages which features beautiful visuals, memorable music, elaborate sets, and unforgettable characters. Judy Garland is adorably innocent as Dorothy Gale and Margaret Hamilton still terrifies me a little as the Wicked Witch of the West. It may be a little slow in parts and feels longer than it actually is (only 101 minutes?), but The Wizard of Oz is a classic family film."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),Over The Rainbow,"In the late 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's studio head Louis B. Mayer had a serious conversation with some of his employees. Mayer wanted MGM to make a fantasy film in the style of Walt Disney's hugely successful ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" from the previous year. After some thought, producer Mervyn LeRoy suggested that L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" could be adapted into a movie. After all, Baum's work was considered an American classic. At that time most films were made in black and white. Working in color meant you had to use a whole new type of camera - and they were big and cumbersome. In addition, MGM was forced to accept a so-called ""Technicolor consultant"" from the camera manufacturer. A man who stood next to the cinematographer and told him how to light every scene. Mayer didn't care, though. He wanted to compete with Disney's pioneering feature. And ""Snow White"" was in color. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was made exclusively at the MGM Studios in Culver City. But it was a messy production. The first director was fired after 12 days. Victor Fleming took over, but he was moved to ""Gone with the Wind"". So, it was up to King Vidor to finish the film. And there were cast changes, too. The Tin Man had an allergic reaction to the silvery makeup and had to be replaced. The Wicked Witch was severely burned when she went up in a puff of smoke. Even Toto (the dog) was out of commission for a week after being stepped on by a crew member. The film had its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Judy Garland then went on an East Coast publicity tour, which included the New York opening of ""Oz"". But it didn't help. ""The Wizard of Oz"" had been so expensive to produce that MGM made a net loss of millions. The studio didn't get their money back until 1949, when the movie had its re-release worldwide. The following year, MGM sold the rights to TV, where the film has been shown ever since."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),Game changer for technicolor,"Where to begin? I have loved this movie since I was a child. It has been a part of my life. I watch it all the time. It has special memories personally and professionally. I wanted to write and make movies because of The Wizard of Oz. I became obsessed with Judy Garland because of the movie. I have books and magazines. There is a lot to say about the film that love but also aware of the negative behind the scenes moments that occurred. Yes, there are flaws in the movie I can point out, but after a while I don't care. The songs are iconic, the story is iconic, and it's very quotable through the decades. And it is still ranked one of the best films of all time on many lists."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),The Wizard of Oz,"This is a film that is timeless. It's from 1939 and everyone knows it. It has the best use of Technicolor up to that point in history. Also this must have been at Cinemas during the outbreak of World War II a time of Universal uncertainty, so it would have been the perfect escapism when it was made. What's not to like, the songs, the Colour, the overall message that whatever you want is something you had all along. Judy Garland is excellent as Dorothy. This is a film that is timeless.

The Wizard of Oz (1939),10/10,"Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball friend Oz, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", and the rest of this beautiful production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" lose little of their magic over the years. While poking fun at this kind of classic, innocent fantasy has become somewhat of a trend in recent years, the film itself has aged well, and will likely retain an appreciative audience for some time to come. Undoubtedly part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from their being old friends with so many cinema fans, but there's also a good reason why they've endured so long, and have endured even after. Becoming all too familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent yet deep passion that is easy to identify with. Also, the 'Oz' characters are quirky enough to remain interesting, but there is a core element that is again believable. Who doesn't feel like they could use at least one of the things Dorothy's friends love? The adaptation from the original story was well done, making good choices for characters and episodes to work into the film. The settings and visual effects may not impress devotees of computer imagery today, but in their time they certainly showed great skill and planning, and even today, in their own way they are more believable than most computer tricks that have become overused. The famous story has also been used for several more recent adaptations, and some of them have their own good points. But this Wizard remains the most impressive of the versions of the classic story."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY... BUT I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,"Thank you Judy Garland and the Wizard, Frank Morgan, for so many memories, then and now. It is so true, how this classic has held up through the years, and in beautiful color. We all remember it being shown once a year on tv (back in the day when there was NO cable). Everyone has passed, but these incredible artists have all left us their true labor of love. The secret, if there really is a secret behind this film's success, is everyone enjoyed each other's company and worked together as a family. You can tell, especially Judy Garland's comments that she found it strange to be so afraid of the Wicked Witch, Margaret Hamilton, because she was such a nice lady. That's family. Get the remastered blu ray dvd, as it is something to truly treasure."
The Wizard of Oz (1939),MAGICAL!!,"Magical, that's the word that describes the movie. Everything about this movie is amazing, visually, sonically, the characters are iconic and Dorothy's music is beautiful, the movie starts ""no color"" and then she enters the Wizarding world of Oz and the world gaining colors
the script is great, the strong point of this film is the story, the characters too but the story really hooks you. One of the best classics I've seen so far. ""There are so many brainless people out there who talk, aren't there?"" Great. The cyclone scene is the best, without a doubt, as I said, visually it is amazing and for a 1939 movie this scene was very well done, the tone everything, the house flying is very well done. Wonderful."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),"Entertainment, but some dark too, like a Hans Christian Anderson book, gothic, humorous, and dark.","I'd pop a warning on this for the youngster of today or parents who tread carefully what their kids watch. This film is an annual tradition for me, my mum took me to see as a kid, and watching on the big screen was amazing, but I was tiny. If someone could add 3D to it, wow it'd be amazing. It is very dated of course, but, beautifully filmed, I've been lucky enough to visit the castle where it was filmed in Bavaria, the scenery is pretty amazing. It is very British eccentric and made in a time when not so many things were 'tiptoed' around, like The Sound of Music, it has some scary dark elements, some dark, almost gothic like tale. Also, some very silly, funny songs and slapstick. When you think about how old it is and how all the stunts and filming were done without special effects, the car alone is a feat of amazing engineering. I defy any adult not to enjoy this film, not sure how many kids would be interested in it now, as it's a rather unusual film really, it makes me realise how different things are now for kids."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),Perfect Childhood Classic,"Never re-create a movie like this, it is timeless, it is perfect. I was born in 1999 and I remember watching this over and over again, I love the music, the setting, the cars, it's amazing. The acting is very good and truly having nothing to complain about. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a timeless movie, no movie producer should ever touch. Just leave this magnificent piece to live on as it originally is. My children will be watching this in the future as I did. It's a fun movie for all ages old and young, and a nostalgic feeling for us to re-watch decades later. I just hope the movie industry does not do what they seem to have been doing with many other good classic movies and re-create it. There is no need. Stop touching out favourite movies. Chitty Chitty is perfect just as it is, as are other movies of it's time."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),"If There's Anything Worse Than An Abject Failure, It's Something That Almost Works","If I chose to be sarcastic, I would claim that the best thing about this movie is that Dick Van Dyke doesn't do a British accent -- indeed, that was one of the conditions under which he took the job. That would be unfair. Certainly, Albert Broccoli and his team worked to produce as good a musical as was being produced in America at the time. They hired Van Dyke, and they tried to get Julie Andrews. They hired the Sherman brothers to write the songs, which are pretty good (except I despise as lazy the title song). They got Roald Dahl to do the screenplay; if anyone understood the darkness at the heart of childhood and how to write about it, it was he. Unfortunately, they then handed it to Ken Hughes to direct, and he could direct trained adult actors and action scenes, but not children. In the end, they spent lots of money, which is on the screen, to produce a road show musical, just as the genre was going stale. While it did well at the box office, its immense costs made it a failure, so they didn't try again. As a result, the movie musical, like the cartoon, entered a dead period from which it, unlike the cartoon, has yet to really recover. Looking at it today, it's quite obviously too long. There's lots of wasted luxury casting, like Lionel Jeffries, Benny Hill, and Sally Ann Howes. While I haven't a single complaint to make about any individual scene or sequence, it goes on too long at 144 minutes, and like many an almost-perfect souflee, collapses on arrival."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),It really is a Truly Scrumptious movie!,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a film I saw as a child, and since my first viewing, I have loved it ever since! Being a big fan of Ian Fleming as a writer and novelist, I suppose it was no surprise when I found myself watching this movie over and over again. A lot like the James Bond franchise, which he created, Fleming also managed to write this fantasy film involving a larger than life plot, beautiful locations, memorable dialogue, and iconic characters, which was now suitable for adults and children to watch and enjoy. I understood from my mother, who was only 5 years old when this film came out in 1968, that the child catcher was a subject of controversy as he was deemed too scary for children. My mother being one of them. I understand how the film has a divided audience because of its edgier theme in the second have of the film, however, in my opinion, the film is fun, catchy, memorable and one I will always hold dear to my heart."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),I grew up with this movie,"(1968) Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
CHILDREN/ MUSICAL/ FANTASY Loosely based on a novel by Ian Fleming co-written and directed by Ken Hughes, owners of the James Bond franchise by the name of Albert R. Broccoli decided to produce this very pretentious musical/ fantasy about eccentric inventor Potts (Dick Van Dyke) many failed attempts to become wealthy by one of his inventions, leading to one invention after the other, whose always impressing his two small children. Liked this film when I was a kid and I still liked this now, catchy song numbers, dancing is fine and the situations Although absurd is obviously intended to be nothing more than a kids movie one can get from a kid's book- I don't anything wrong with that."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),Anna Quayle,"I've loved this movie for decades. Yet it's only in this latest visit that I finally noticed and found myself utterly charmed by Anna Quayle's performance. How did I miss this? I rewatched about a half dozen times her duet with Gert Frobe, a dance in which he's repeatedly trying to kill her and she's largely oblivious. Her physicality and subtleness of voice and expression is a joy to behold. Especially the moment she's almost impaled from above lying on the table as some doubt about her husband's affections dawns upon her. She's never singled out, if even mentioned, in the reviews I've read. Just want to express my appreciation even if the critics won't."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"This was never my favourite musical as child, but as I get older I think I appreciate it more. Sure, it has it's cheesy moments, but there is genuine chemistry between the characters on display here and coupled with some superbly catchy - and often poignant - lyrics from the Sherman twins, we are presented with a really quite enjoyable fable. The Potts family live in a dilapidated farmhouse. Grandfather (Lionel Jeffries); the well meaning but hopeless inventor of a father ""Caractacus"" (Dick Van Dyke) and the two children ""Jeremy"" (Adrian Hall) and ""Jemima"" (Heather Ripley). Luckily, one day the youngsters are nearly run over by ""Truly"" (Sally Ann Howes) the daughter of the wealthy confectioner ""Lord Scrumptious"" (James Robertson Justice). She might just be able to help the father make a few quid from her father with his sweets that double up as pan pipes. Meantime, the family manage to rescue an old rust bucket from the local garage, and lo and behold, enter our eponymous vehicle. It can drive, it can become an aeroplane, an hovercraft - indeed it can do just about everything bar make the tea. It's a must-have prize for the megalomaniac child-hater ""Baron Bomburst"" (Gert Fröbe - who really does enter into the spirit of the story), so the family must fight tooth and nail to stop their car, and themselves, falling into his malevolent hands. Ian Fleming demonstrates great imagination with this and Van Dyke shows off his varied skills well and engagingly. Howes over-cooks her singing at times, but the almost 2½ hours this story takes really does fly by. The Oscar winning ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""; the delightful ""Hushabye Mountain""; ""Me Ol' Bamboo"" and Jeffries' enjoyable rendition of ""Posh!"" as he is gradually drowned in his outhouse all add bundles to this colourful and joyous series of well photographed escapades. Maybe it is wasted on youngsters? It certainly was on me!"
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),Charming but overlong,"This film has a nigh epic length of 2 hours and 24 minutes but as you watch the film you'll notice that most of this running time is taken up by music numbers which seem to occur every few minutes. These musical interludes, though rather catchy and clever, go on too long and don't do much to advance the story. One such number goes on and on about a candy called ""Toot Sweets"" only for the magical whistling candies are shown to be problematic because they attract dogs (I thought high-pitched whistles repel dogs). Another one features the villain, the dictatorial Bomburst, singing stupid pet names with his screechy wife. This does nothing for the story and since it's about the unsympathetic villain, it can hardly be considered endearing, so I can only assume this is meant to be funny, though the humor factor is rather iffy. The title song, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", is another catchy tune, but, again, it doesn't do much to advance the story and gets repetitive after a while (Okay, we get it, the car is great). Other than that, this film has dark overtones, in which people are threatened with decapitation. Also, children are captured and enslaved and there is a creepy character called the Child Catcher, who is likely nightmare fuel for many a young tot. The story could easily be imagined as a horror story. On the plus side, the special effects and production values are very good."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),"Utmost ridiculous whimsy - an absolute joy, a classic, a must-see!","When I told a friend that I was soon going to watch this for the first time, he half-jokingly warned that the more one watches, the less it makes sense. That remark bears more truth to it than I could have supposed, for this is an unending stream of such wild fancy that it splits the divide between pure imagination and straight-up fever dream. This is never more true than with the incredibly lighthearted, fleet-footed songs of Richard M. And Robert B. Sherman, and the impeccable, wondrous choreography of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, but that same duality comes across in pretty much every last regard. The incredible filming locations are made to feel rather whimsical themselves, aided to that end in light of production design and art direction that really seem to adopt the ethos of ""if you can dream it, we'll find a way to include it."" This also goes for the wide-ranging frivolity of the costume design, and the terrific hair and makeup; every stunt, visual effect, sound effect, and fabricated conjuration looks great at the same time that it's often a little bewildering. And still we're just scraping the surface of everything 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' represents, and as if to emphasize the point - what a name! For everything that fills these two and one-half hours, there's weirdly not that much plot in it. At the same time, at almost exactly the halfway mark it's like a switch has been flipped, taking us from considerable content with minimal substance, to total cartoonish silliness. This is more curious still when one realizes that the original book was written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming, the screenplay was adapted by director Ken Hughes (also associated with strange 1967 disaster 'Casino Royale') with children's book author and notorious bigot Roald Dahl - and that Albert R. Broccoli, who was behind so much of Eon Productions' 007 franchise, also produced this, with a cast including Gert Fröbe (Goldfinger), Desmond Llewelyn (Q), and Benny Hill (he of ""Yakkety sax"" fame). And still, Hughes' orchestration of every shot and scene, and Christopher Challis' cinematography, similarly embrace that same spirit of unbridled fun while at once also being stupendously smart and delicious in and of themselves. Not to be outdone, Irwin Kostal penned a score (informed by the Shermans' tunes) that's perfectly light and cheerful over every scene in which the cast give wholehearted performances of unyielding merriment and zest. 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is unremitting in its extravagant ridiculousness, a cavalcade of one gag and bit after another. Yet like The Beatles' surrealist quasi-nightmare 'Yellow submarine,' it's that complete immersion in the inane that allows this to work; add a tinge of sincerity to provide an almost indifferent anchor, and the stage is set for this to be whatever it wants. Irreverent as it all is, however, every last element is guided toward the same ends, and the result is nothing less than fabulous. Everyone involved in the production turned in truly outstanding work across the board, and that includes the screenplay. Where the movie decides to have a plot, it's written with sharp intelligence; where the movie insists on just having a good time, whatever that may mean, the scene writing is robust and superbly detailed, and the rest of the craftsmanship follows suit without fail. At all points the dialogue and characters are astoundingly colorful and varied in accordance with the need of a tale in which anything goes. And so it is on down the line from start to finish, as in one way or another the feature is just a boundless bounty of bounding, bouncing, buoyant joy, realized with only utmost care and skill. I fully expected to enjoy this, based not just on its reputation but on the strong recommendation of everyone with whom I'd ever discussed it. And still I'm ever so pleased at what a delight the film turned out to be; there are few points of comparison for a title that's so utterly resolute in its assumption of every conceivable pinch of far-flung tomfoolery. Naturally Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes curry the most favor given their prominence, but everyone in the cast and crew, and indeed everyone who participated in the work's creation, are to be congratulated for whipping up such an extraordinary, enduring, impressively enthusiastic and unfaltering flight of fancy. Given such unwavering commitment to so offbeat and preposterous an affair I can understand how this won't necessarily appeal to all - but the fact unquestionably remains that 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is so absolutely, wonderfully entertaining in every regard that I'd be hard-pressed not to give a blanket recommendation. This is a tremendous, almost unparalleled classic that never feels as long as its two and one-half hours, and is worth far more than that. More than 50 years later it continues to be an exquisite marvel, and when all is said and done it's simple a must-see. Bravo!"
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968),Chitty Offers Up a Unique Fantasy World,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang tells the tale a creator who is always inventing interesting, but not always practical or necessary, or overcomplicated things and a flying/swimming car is just one of his many inventions. There are a couple tuneful and memorable songs and musical numbers. There is also one of the creepiest characters to be found in any children's film in the form of the Child Catcher, brilliantly portrayed Roger Helpmann. There are all kinds of odd and unique supporting characters throughout. The film does seem to meander quite a bit at times and weakens this film which could have been greatly improved with the help of some prudent editing, perhaps 10-15 minutes worth. Either way, it's still a fun film to check out if you haven't yet done so."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Good movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I have made it a habit to speak out on Disney's live action movies because I think they get unnecessary hate. I watch the original before watching the live action. Emma does a great job of playing belle. I am in love with the animation behind the other characters. It's well done and looks real. This movie followed the original almost to the t. I appreciate the extras that were thrown in. It really adds flavor to the movie. The ending wasn't perfect. However, it wasn't detrimental to the movie. Really enjoyed it. Highly recommend it. I would watch it again and excited for what else Disney has in store."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Decent,"All opinions are my own. A decent remake. Locations are absolutely gorgeous and I love that they showed more of the main characters' backstories...though I feel that Belle's was poorly placed since during her time as a ""prisoner"", she should have been wanting to see her father, not her birthplace. They could have added it near the end as a conclusion. (Though yes it will make it end on a sad note.) Definitely very obvious that Disney tried to push 'diversity' in this movie. Yes, it's a fictional world. But they don't treat all their movies the same. Most of their budget seems to have gone to the cast or the architecture of the castle/village. The beast and wolves do not look good, especially for a movie in 2017. And that yellow gown...Seemed like they tried to copy that same magic from the Cinderella live action, and failed. It just looks so underwhelming..must be the sleeves...Same with the red robe actually, it looks cheap."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Beautiful production!,"Although I have a few things I think it could be improved, like some specific parts where the scene cuts seemed a little bit rushed and even the plot transition that I honestly don't remember how it was done in the past in the original since I watched many years ago, I have to say that the music scenes were really masterfully crafted, well deserved for a Disney production celebrating 30th anniversary of this classic masterpiece of the classic cinema. The music that happens in the dinner room specifically totally surprised me for the color, the very complex integration between the dish characters and all the lighting and camera movements that was soooo soo soooo pleasing to watch! People always complain about casting and stuff, and that always can be reasonable, but I'm particularly satisfied with the casting selection and the actors. So I think 8 is a fair rating in my opinion."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Well done Disney.,"My daughters loved this, so the rating is mostly based on their reaction. However, for my part, it's a worthy retelling of a classic children's story with amazing sets & costumes. The CGI was well done & the actors did their part. The Beast was intimidating but not terrifying, so our 5 year old was able to watch it with her older sister. The wolves were probably the scariest part of the movie, but even our young one didn't duck behind her blanket for them. The casting of Belle was spot on. Ewan McGregor proved, once again, that he can shine in a musical & Luke Evans was an excellent Gaston. Well done Disney."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),I actually really enjoyed this live action version of this movie.,"While the movie is a remake on the original and have a couple of differences with it, I really think it's a pretty great remake. The movie itself looks great with its set design and cinematography that goes with it. It really makes the movie looks beautiful on how they executed it. The story is basically the same with a couple of differences to it and I do think it done really well. I also like the casting of the movie which they did a pretty great job on the roles they were given. Emma Watson as Bella is a decent choice, but she isn't the best actress in the movie. I also think the songs are done really well and the singing is great in the movie. Now, the CGI of the movie is something that I have mixed thoughts about. The new design for the characters falls between looking pretty good to not looking impressive at all due to how they design them. As for the beast, I do like this new design for him and does have details on him."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),"No, just no","This film are nothing like the original, in a bad way. The added scenes are bad, and do nothing for the film. I do not like any of the live action disney films. I wished they make the live action the same as the originals. This film and the singing is rally bad! I needed a pilliow everytime they started singing. CRINGE! And the voice for the clock! Can not just use the voice of gandalv. It feels so wrong! I do not like the actors either. It is so sad they feel they have to change the classics. It feels like they think they have to make it so much more fantastical. Do not change what is already perfect."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),our favorite movie,"From the very beginning, Beauty and the Beast captivates the audience with its stunning visuals, expertly crafted set designs, and elaborate costumes. The picturesque French village and the grandeur of Beast's castle are brought to life in a way that immerses viewers into the magical world of Belle (Emma Watson) and the Beast (Dan Stevens). Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle is captivating, as she brings a modern and independent twist to the character. She embodies Belle's intelligence, kindness, and unwavering spirit, making her an incredibly relatable and empowering role model for today's generation. Dan Stevens brilliantly embodies the tortured and misunderstood Beast, conveying his inner conflict between anger and vulnerability. The chemistry between Watson and Stevens is palpable, making their evolving relationship feel truly heartfelt and sincere. The film's all-star supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances by Luke Evans as Gaston, the narcissistic antagonist, and Josh Gad as LeFou, Gaston's loyal but conflicted sidekick. These characters bring a perfect balance of humor and depth to the story, adding an extra layer of entertainment."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Lovely one,"Beauty and the Beast (2017), a spellbinding journey that breathes new life into a beloved tale as old as time. Emma Watson's portrayal of Belle is enchanting, bringing intelligence and warmth to the iconic character. The film editing dances gracefully through the enchanting sequences, seamlessly transitioning between the whimsy of the castle and the quaint charm of the village. The film's strength lies in its vibrant and nostalgic homage to the animated classic, with a cast that brings depth to the beloved characters. While the music tugs at the heartstrings, there are moments where the pacing feels a touch too swift, racing to keep up with the magic. Cinematography bathes the audience in a visually stunning world, from the grandeur of the Beast's castle to the lively spectacle of ""Be Our Guest."" At 7/10, Beauty and the Beast is a magical retelling that captures the spirit of the original while adding a touch of modern enchantment."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Too much singing!,"Ok, I get it, it's a musical, but man, there's waaay too much singing, which makes the movie kind of boring. It felt like they sang for like a good third of the movie, maybe even more, and honestly, the songs were kinda meh, dull and pointless. Now, the cast, ugh. Dan Stevens in the main male role? Seriously? He didn't give off any royal vibes. And in my opinion, he looked better as the hairy beast than as the prince. And let's talk about the film set - it was gloomy and kinda dull. And don't even get me started on the character makeup - it was just plain weird, ridiculous, or even hideous, I would say."
Beauty and the Beast (I) (2017),Not a Belle Anymore,"Cannot believe this updated version is just 6-years-old now. This movie feels like it came out 26 years ago. Decided to finally have an open-mind on the Disney Cash Grab Remakes of the already-masterpieces they made decades ago. Kinda sorry I did, even though this movie is serviceable. Not great or even very good. It's definitely nothing I'd ever want to see again. The original's near perfect, in fact, I can find very little flaws. While I love 1989's The Little Mermaid more, any argument can be made why 1991's Beauty & the Beast is superior. I mean, Belle, what an incredible character and so unselfish. I loved every bit of the 1991 version and there's a very valid reason it was the first animated movie to be nominated for best picture. This updated version is just okay, I mean I didn't hate it despite the poor CGI, creepy ""inanimate"" characters, Emma Watson butchering my favorite Disney song, ""Belle"" and the terrible new songs that padded the already-too-long runtime. This 2017 version felt VERY Community Theatre and made me lighten up for the performances, as if they were actors in a neighborhood theatre pouring their hearts out. WHY do these remakes have to be ONE FULL HOUR longer when the stories are essentially the same? Yes, as mentioned, they add in cringe new songs, but other than that, I don't know why they subject us to mediocrity for even longer than necessary. The only character I liked was the updated LeFou and believe me, I've been in his longing-for-who-you'll-never-get shoes. At least I had someone to root for and was pleased with how his arc played out. I wish I could say I didn't regret seeing the 2017 take, but I kinda do. Everything was flat, dark and no one could hold a Lumière to the original. Skip this. *** Final Thoughts: Really sorry this made a ton of money so Disney could open the floodgates to more embarrassing shot-by-shot ""live"" action meh remakes. Unless you have a complete reimagining, such as Maleficent or Cruella, I wish they wouldn't bother. (2017 version: 4/10 Stars, 1991 version: 10/10 Stars.)"
Next Goal Wins (2023),Harmless fun - don't believe the bad reviews,"I don't understand the bad reviews this film received. I honestly enjoyed it and found it fun. In fact it really cheered me up when I was feeling a bit rubbish. They state their intention right away by claiming upfront there are embellishments and Michael Fassbender doesn't even attempt to do Rongen's accent so it is clear this is just a bit of harmless entertainment. If you want the 100% factual story watch the documentary Next Goal Wins. There were some LOL moments and really funny lines. I would say it is a feelgood story that I would happily see with my mum, my brother or my boyfriend. If you are someone who prefers more sophisticated or satirical comedy then it may not be for you, but if you just want a good inoffensive film then I can recommend it. There are some good comedy performances from the cast and it does make you want to go and google the real people I am a Taika and Fassbender fan so maybe I am biased but I think this is more an audience film than a critic's film. I am going to go to the cinema and see it again which I rarely do so that says something."
Next Goal Wins (2023),"Once upon a time, Taika was Waititi.","And now, Taika Waititi is not himself anymore. Looking for something new, special, particular and excessive, trying to make a movie potentially likeable by all kinds of person in the world, Taika created instead a low level work, neither able to let people smile in the typical Waititi style. It is sad to see a director doing steps behind instead to be better and better, but this is what this movie is, a strong step behind. I really hope that the next time we'll be able to see again the real Waititi, because what is crystal clear to me and so man Italian and Canadian movie critics is that at the moment Waititi lost is magic touch."
Next Goal Wins (2023),"A heartwarming tale of soccer, culture, and community in American Samoa","Taika Waititi's Next Goal Wins isn't your average underdog sports story. It's a sun-drenched odyssey, a hilarious clash of cultures, and a heartwarming testament to the power of community. We're thrust onto the dusty shores of American Samoa, where the national soccer team holds the dubious honour of being the world's worst. Enter Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), a washed-up coach with a temper shorter than a tiki torch. His mission? Whip these lovable misfits into shape for the World Cup qualifiers, a feat that seems as likely as a beach coconut spontaneously combusting. Waititi, with his trademark blend of quirky humour and genuine pathos, expertly navigates the film's tonal tightrope. Think Lost in Translation meets a soccer field when picturing Rongen's cultural clashes. Then, suddenly, the players' unwavering spirit and the island's diverse cultural heritage move you. The film doesn't shy away from the team's underdog status, but it also avoids wallowing in self-pity. Instead, it celebrates their resilience, their infectious joy, and their unwavering belief in the impossible. Fassbender delivers a nuanced performance as Rongen, a man grappling with his past demons while trying to inspire a team he barely understands. The supporting cast shines equally bright, with characters like the flamboyant Jaiyah Saelua (Kaimana), who is fa'afafine, a third gender recognised in Polynesian society, and the stoic goalkeeper Nicky Salapu (Uli Latukefu) injecting the film with humour and heart. The cinematography is a character in itself, capturing the island's breathtaking beauty and the raw energy of the game. The score, a vibrant mix of traditional Samoan music and pulsating electro beats, perfectly complements the film's emotional rollercoaster. While Next Goal Wins isn't without its flaws-the pacing occasionally stumbles, and the ending might feel a tad predictable-its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It's a film that reminds us that victory isn't always about winning trophies but about finding your own ""next goal"" and chasing it with all your heart. So, should you watch Next Goal Wins? Absolutely. It's a crowd-pleaser in the best sense-a film that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer as you root for the underdogs who dare to dream big. It's a cinematic sunshine break, a reminder that even in the face of impossible odds, the human spirit can soar like a perfectly executed bicycle kick."
Next Goal Wins (2023),"I really, really enjoyed it.","Thomas Rongen is brought in to manage The American Samoa football team, his brief is to get the team to score a single goal in The World cup qualifiers. A team that was sitting at the bottom of the rankings list, and famously lost 31 nil to Australia. Instantly you'll recognise that Taika Waititi is behind this film, his style is etched all over it, and as I eagerly await the second series of Our flag means death, this hits the mark. It's not perfect, arguably it's a little slow to start, but as it develops, it just gets better and better, and by the end, I was absolutely engrossed. Funny, moving, uplifting, it's real life given a feel good twist, a great film for the whole family to enjoy. I recently read an article from an American website, which was discussing the fact that so many American parts were being played by Brits, here's another example of that, Michael Fassbender does such a great job as Rongen, proving he can do comedy very well. Well worth seeing. 8/10."
Next Goal Wins (2023),"Simple, uplifting soccer story","'Next Goal Wins' is Taika Waititi's 8th film as director, and is another heartfelt little comedy gem, much more similar to 'Boy' and 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' than his other films. It's based on a true story, after the Socceroos beat American Samoa 31-0 in a World Cup Qualifier in 2001. The 'boss' of American Samoa Football, Tavita (Kightley) then hires semi-disgraced coach Thomas Rongen (Fassbender) to try to help them to score just one goal. Thomas doesn't necessarily want to be there and the reasons for his anger are slowly revealed over the course of the film. The other main character who has a nice journey is Jaiyah (Kaimana), which is portrayed very well. Sadly it was filmed in Hawaii - not American Samoa or Tonga, but still looks great and gives it a tropical Polynesian vibe. Most of the film follows common misfits-to-sporting-heroes tropes, but is still based in reality - i.e. The team doesn't go on to win the World Cup or anything! Good support cast, with Waititi favourites Rachel House & Rhys Daby present and small roles for Will Arnett & Elizabeth Moss, and the over-zealous Australians, Angus Sampson & Luke Hemsworth. The soundtrack is good, and the portrayal of American Samoan culture is done well, particularly the pre-match war dances. The pacing is also good, with it not being too long, and there's a nice balance between jokes and some of the touching/character-building moments. It's nice to see Thomas come around and the positivity and happiness all the American Samoans show him and each other. The final game is well-edited and exciting, a fitting finish."
Next Goal Wins (2023),Quirky and real - joyful,"I loved this movie so much was such a fun ride and I laughed the opening sequence for about 10 minutes afterwards. A great window into the soul of American Samoans who are shown to be kind and resourceful, made me want to buy a ticket to visit !! Loved how this movie ebbed and flowed and built with the ending so moving and the whole packed theatre cheered. Well done to the storytellers and director who made this fun and kept the tempo. The movie also broke down negative stereotypes and created a chance for empathy and compassion. I will spend hours searching the characters and the story which is a gem !"
Next Goal Wins (2023),A Wholesome Feelgood Movie,"Taika Waititi has created a post-Lasso football comedy feel-good story that explores Samoan culture based around a true story. Does it feel derivative of Ted Lasso? Sure. Does that necessarily matter? Not really. It takes the blueprint and does good on it. Waititi has jumped at the opportunity to comedically share Samoan culture through this theme, being of part Polynesian descent himself. The story follows a riled up and downtrodden football coach, Thomas Rongen (Fassbender) who ends up in American Samoa to manage their national football team; in need of an overhaul in time for the world cup qualifiers. Once there, he embarks unwittingly on a journey of self-discovery. Nods are made to key aspects of Samoan culture and economics, such as tuna exports, acceptance of transgenderism, its intense religiosity, and the omnipresence of U. S. military enlistment for Samoans looking to make a livelihood. Football is seen as a sort of respite for a politically disenfranchised and isolated community of islanders. Waititi shows the warmth and soulfulness of the Samoan people alongside the timeless suspense and entertainment of football. There's a lot to love here, even if character development of the team itself was lacking, with the exception of transgender character Jaiyah (Kaimana), and arguably Nicky Salapu (Uli Latukefu). 7.5/10."
Next Goal Wins (2023),NEXT GOAL WINS!,"I just got back from watching this movie, and I have some really great things to say about this film. The film comes from a true story of a football team from American Samoa and in the many years the team has been going they have not scored a single goal. That is until a man called Thomas rongen comes to town after losing his job and is put on to coach the (worst team in the world) He coaches the team and shows this throughout the film and when it comes to the big match, they fear it will become the same as the match in Australia in 2001 which led to 31-0 to Australia. Later in the match the first half went by and they were losing, then the coach explained how he was hating the world because his beloved daughter died in a car accident. After half time they got back on the pitch and scored not 1 but 2 goals leading the American Samoans to their very first victory in the history of the world. I would highly recommend the following film as it is like an emotional roller coaster."
Next Goal Wins (2023),"Great fun, heartwarming","Easy viewing, lots of funny moments. Great to see films about Polynesian culture that made with actors and crew connected to the culture. Predictable storyline but still interesting, humorous and entertaining, especially as it is basically all historically correct. Loved the inclusion of Kaimana playing Jaiyah who was the first openly trans person to compete in international soccer. Apparently Jaiyah wasn't in the team in this point of history in real life, but they are a real person and I thought it was great that their story was incorporated into the movie. Taika clearly cares about this project. Hilarious dialogue that was apparently mostly improvised. Not the best movie in the entire world but good fun, enlightening and worth a watch."

Air (I) (2023),The rise of Nike and Jordan,"Directed by Ben Affleck and starring Matt Damon, Air is a dramatic film that at first doesn't seem to offer much. What makes this film interesting is how it chronicles the creation of a series of sports shoes and the Nike corporation's attempt to make a deal with Michael Jordan. It seems like a small thing, but it was an event that would leave precedents in the history of sports, taking the Nike corporation to the top, changing the corporate paradigm of the sports footwear industry and bringing Michael Jordan himself to stardom. The film does not show the events as such, it simply uses dialogues between the businessmen to narrate the process. Matt Damon presents a quite astute and determined character who knows how to use his wit very well. Although Chris Tucker doesn't appear much, he doesn't lose that comedic energy that made him memorable in the Rush Hour trilogy. Michael Jordan's appearance in the film is quite mysterious because it does not show his face and that may be a bit disappointing for those who knew him, either because of his basketball games or because of his participation in Space Jam. Anyway, it is understandable because of the time in which the film was made and the time in which the events take place. In addition, the film has a good soundtrack of eighties songs, giving this film an eighties feel that feels almost nostalgic. Even the introduction that begins the credits is a nice collage of television broadcasts from that time. Air is a good dramatic film with a good plot that Ben Affleck knew how to execute, showing that he is capable of directing good films and not just acting in them. My final rating for this movie is an 8/10."
Air (I) (2023),Today's basketball shoes come in really big . . .,". . . boxes. During my grandparents' time, many if not most people had much smaller feet. Seven-footers were few and far between. Throughout the Twentieth Century, Society considered 72-inches to be the epitome of height--for men. Ladies were expected to limit their growth to 64 inches. Songs said that 62 inches was an even better feminine height, especially for blue-eyed gals. In the highly unlikely event that someone attained growth exceeding 78 inches, with proportionately-sized feet, he was expected to navigate life unshod. However, AIR seems to encourage the rapid proliferation of prodigious foot growth, and the humongous shoe boxes said extremities appear to require."
Air (I) (2023),Michael Jordan drives a hard bargain,"Ben Affleck has again proven himself a wonderful director. What could have been a big yawn is a funny, absorbing, and well-paced film. It's the story of a loser basketball show manufacturer, Nike, and one man's determination to land Michael Jordan as a product endorser. We know Jordan signed and came up with the Air Jordan shoe. What I liked about this film was that knowing what was going to happen did not make it less suspenseful - we see what Sonny Vacarro (Matt Damon) went through was impressive, not only at the company but with the Jordan family. I loved the humor - I will watch Jason Bateman in anything. He's great here, as are Chris Tucker, Ben Affleck, and Dave Messina. Highly recommended for the story and the performances."
Air (I) (2023),Good film overall!,"Good film overall! I really liked this film, I'm starting to enjoy films with Ben Affleck behind the camera. For this one we're lucky enough to see him in front of the camera too, accompanied by a Matt Damon who is a pleasure to watch. The beginning of the film is a bit long, but once things get going it's a great lesson in perseverance from Nike. I didn't know the story of the Nike-Jordan collaboration before seeing the film, and it was interesting to see how it came about, and how it must have influenced future collaborations between players and brands... Special mention to the cast, which I adore: Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Viola Davis, Jason Bateman and the others!"
Air (I) (2023),This movie is like watching paint dry,"The story is poorly written and not engaging. The actors are ok. Unfortunately they couldn't save this boring movie. If you love watching middle aged corporate execs trying to make more money, you'll love this. Otherwise, skip it. The one good thing about this movie is the music and nostalgia. Nike, adidas, converse...a big competition for who can sell more snake oil. Selling a dream to kids about something they're never going to be able to attain. It's a great story of corporate triumph over its competitors. It's not really inspiring, funny, or even interesting. Unfortunately, I wasted two hours I won't ever get back."
Air (I) (2023),Blockbuster,"Statesman here by and request for fit to scale hands down. One of the best sports films with remembered legend the all time great MJ. I thought it to be high in ratings while in theaters, it became everything and more through the timeline. With championships on the line it's evident sales went through the roof for cooperate. I learned so much about the game through general business administration. Great film! My favorite part about the movie was definitely the collab prior to the biggest sales meeting of the era. I laughed and cried and had emotions through the roof just to conclude my feelings about the sport and mental health. Way to go!"
Air (I) (2023),"It's no Godfather, but it's not the worst movie ever made.","I agree that the movie was very ""meh,"" but I still enjoyed it (while making holiday cards). As Isaac Asimov famously said,"" There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."" In other words, ""Don't believe everything you think."" I just find it amusing how many people make assumptions, and are so certain of themselves, yet their criticism has no basis in reality ""First, the storyline is very good though I don't trust its honesty based on Hollywood's track record of distorting so-called true stories.""
""but much of it doesn't appear to be factual ""
Here is some advice for all the wannabe film critics out there: When a film is billed ""based on true events,"" that means...take it with a grain of salt. Filmmakers use a lot of artistic license; they are accorded leeway in his or her interpretation of something and is not held strictly accountable for accuracy. It's not a documentary. Show me ONE, just ONE movie ""based on true events"" that is 100% accurate. They do not exist. This is for all the cry babies who object to the fact that Jordan did not appear in the film...which, by the way, the cry babies could have looked up, but no, they wanted to complain. ""MJ is a legend, he's such a god you can't show his likeness, you might be Charlie Hebdo'd.""
In the midst of promoting the film, Ben Affleck has given an interview to the Hollywood Reporter, where he explained the conscious and excellent decision for the star not to appear in the film. ""When you become much more than a hero, an athlete or even an icon, you start to be an idea to people. You touch them and you start to represent hope, excellence and greatness. You are unique,"" he began. ""There was no way I was going to ask the public to believe that someone other than Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan. It was a deliberate choice. I thought he was too majestic for anyone to imitate. Jordan is too big,"" he continued. One guy said: ""However, the film neglects to tell us that Vaccaro soon left Nike to work for Adidas.""
Actually he was fired by Nike in 1991 - six years after the release of Air Jordans - but moved on to work for Adidas and then for Reebok. He and Strasser and Moore all went to Adidas, where they forged that company's floundering basketball program into Nike's biggest competitor. This is for all the cry babies who complained about the Jordans' ""greed.""
No, the Jordan family was not greedy. That scene was pure fiction. In reality, Deloris never insisted on Jordan getting a cut of the profits from his shoe, but she was instrumental in pushing Michael to pick Nike's offer over other, more prestigious sneaker deals. Mrs. Jordan heads several charities. In 1989, Mrs. Jordan and her son co-founded the Michael Jordan Foundation to raise money for disadvantaged children. Not only was she the President of the foundation, but she also began the Michael Jordan Education Club that encouraged students to improve their grades and attendance. Soooo greedy, huh? Michael Jordan did not receive the red Mercedes 380SL he insisted on from all three interested parties. Instead, Vaccaro pulled out two toy cars and started rolling them on the conference table. ""Yet big corporations can make 'movies' like this to inject their brand into the brains of people.""
""Objectionable propoganda (sic) for Nike and Jordan, and Ben Affleck should be ashamed of himself.""
""This film was made by Nike, for Nike and to increase Nike's sales. "" Nope. Ben Affleck did not seek Nike's approval for 'Air' - only Michael Jordan's. ""It's not a history of Nike,"" Affleck said of his new film. ""There's interviews and books about that."""
Air (I) (2023),Another winning piece of work by Ben Affleck,"Well what can I say? I really really enjoyed this movie. Ben Affleck creating another masterpiece of a movie here, with his and Matt Damon's new company ""Artists equity"". Great to see Ben and Matt playing together again I have to stick with what someone said that the simplicity of the movie is also it's strength. No big sets, no big plotholes or any kind of these things, just great actors and filmmakers and you get something like this. I just don't understand that it hasn't made more money Recently I saw the (2009) movie ""State of play"" and thought to myself that it could've been made by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. That's how good I think it was. I really think that Ben and Matt's production company is a great asset to the film industry. Can't wait for future projects, keep it comming."
Air (I) (2023),"Interesting Movie, Lots of Unnecessary Profanity","I really liked the subject of this movie as it fundamentally changed what we now know as a huge business. The casting was good, especially Viola Davis as Jordan's mother who delivered an outstanding performance. I enjoyed all the nostalgic clips as it brought you back into the period of the times. The only downside I found was the excessive vulgar language. Maybe the original individuals talked that way, but this is, at the end of the day, an entertainment and the ridiulous use of expetives didn't make it any more edgy...just crass. It has little to do with the story and a good actor can deliver the same sentiment without being so vulgar. I wanted my mother to see this film as she is a huge basketball fan and it saddened me to see her cringe while watching a story she was very interested in. Hollywood...get a grip. You're trying to shape culture with your propaganda and we all know how out of touch you are with us normal people."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Absolute masterpiece,"Absolutely excellent. The film begins with Carroll Shelby at the helm of a race car at Le Man's. The movie quick identifies why he can no longer race for himself, and transiting into his business. The movie has nearly non- stop racing action, and manages to make all of the drama of the business endeavors as exciting as pinning the throttle down the Mulsanne straight. There is no limit of technical details, as the movie covers how the GT40 engineers overcame each pitfall of the car. You get to enjoy the progress of the vehicle, the racing, and Shelby as a brand. The acting is spot on, and the cast clearly has chemistry behind the scenes that makes this movie as great as it is. I've watched this movie with people that have no in- depth knowledge of cars, engineering, or any characters. Unanimously, the film comes through in every way you could want. My only want, is that more movies are made just like this one."
Le Mans '66 (2019),This masterpiece reminds me of another masterpiece,"When watching this for the first time, it felt like I was watching The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix (Flåklypa Grand Prix in Norwegian) as a kid. Bale is absolutely one of the most intruiging and versatile actors. Everytime I watch him I almost have to remind myself that he's Christian Bale, and that he plays another man. He is so good in transforming and embodying another person that its almost freightning. The cast is great. The story is exhilirating. The audio is fantastic. The visuals are staggering. The racing scenes are magnificent. Btw, if you like Le Mans '66, you are gonna love Pinchcliffe Grand Prix."
Le Mans '66 (2019),motorsport,"The Kings of Asphalt, starring Oscar-winning actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale, is a biographical film released in 2019. In the movie, based on a true story, Ford Automobile aims to beat Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, known as the longest race in history. For this, they begin to design a vehicle together with car designers Carroll Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale). Even though it was about the 1966 Le Mans races, the image quality and graphics were at a high level. Night shots were especially exciting. The film's cinematographer, Phedon Papamichael, seems to have done a good job. Also, the vehicles in the movie are completely real. So they didn't come up with a computer design. This is another enjoyable part of the job. The acting was sufficient for this movie, which was static except for the racing parts. In fact, it was too much for a drama movie. Jon Bernthal, whom we also know from The Walking Dead series, was at least as good as the leading roles. It was the first time in over 50 years that a motor sports film (previously Grand Prix, 1966) won an Oscar. Oscar awards were given to the best sound editing and best editing. The first names considered for the leading roles in Kings of Asphalt were Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Maybe they could have won the best actor Oscar with these names. However, it is not known whether the movie would seem this sincere. Because Bale now sets the bar so high that you break away from the movie and just watch Bale. In recent years, more sports movies have started to be made. The 2013 movie Zafere Rush is one of them. They are similar in fiction to the Kings of Asphalt. Although Rush had a weaker cast, I liked this movie more because it was about the more popular Formula Grand Prix. However, none of these prevent the Kings of Asphalt from making history."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Ford v Ferrari a true masterpiece of filmmaking,"10/10 This movie is a perfect adaptation of a true story keeping almost everything and exaggerating certain elements to make it more entertaining, and the action is intense and can be chaotic but it's always clear what's going on,even though there's only one fist fight this movie has some of the best action I've ever seen in my entire life and this movie is drama is the best in any movie you empathize with the characters and you feel the drama and did it's not overwhelming and also not just dumb sappiness like lesser movies, part of what makes the drama so effective in the movie is that they draw you in with comedy not just endless drama which makes it so you can never get drawn in, however I feel I have to mention I am a bit biased I absolutely love cars and 60s cars are my favorite out of any decade of cars, but even if you're not in the cars it's a must see."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Masterpiece sports action biography,"I loved the plot continuity+Pace of this film with good story structure and characters arcs. Kick it into 7000 rpm and enjoy a brief ride through history when considering watching this solid film, Ford Versus Ferrari. The exhilarating true story behind the 1966 24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender. Director James Mangold takes on the American story that rewrote racing history displaying some of the most exciting scenes we have seen this year in 2019. From the drivers POV to the spectators POV, we are taking a journey with all who witnessed this great victory and the events that lead up to it."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Another bad movie on racing,"Cardboard acting , cardboard script , cardboard directing. This movie is pretty bad . Practicly all of the actors with a few exceptions act pretty bad . Sometimes it seems as if they were never into the movie . They act as if ' oh I have to do a scene , then pick up the kids from school and make dinner also "" . Most of them over-act their character and then we get on top typical stupid scenes like the little boy or wife listening to the radio in a total stupid way. This is not the quality to expect like something as Apollo 13 where the acting is normal instead of over-acting and putting down stupid characters and scenes. Ever seen a racing driver riding next to each other and facing each other on full speed .....well reality is far away in this output. We also get some music that does not fit the year in question. And all this is pretty much the fault of the director ."
Le Mans '66 (2019),7000 times to relive your life,"As a 1960s race car biography movie, it is very well done. Every ratings fields nearly shine out up until the dramatic moments (a mere few seconds of those) that I wasn't expecting cause I knew nothing about the real Ken Miles and his passing in 1966 in a car testing accident. It took me by surprise and after that it was like powders of sadness were poured over the afterward scenes and even the entire film. In my opinion, a more detailed depiction of the last moments was needed to highlight the contrast between his ""safe"" racing (race driving) and the seemingly innocuous test drive that he probably had done a dozen times. Nevertheless, that's a superb biographical movie with a bright cast and an uncompromising flow. I'm still saddened. I don't know why. One of the rare time that the death of a character struck me. Kudos Christian Bale, kudos Matt Damon (still see your tears and feel the lump in your throat). Screenplay/storyline/plots: 8.5 Development: 9 Realism: 9 Entertainment: 9 Acting: 9 Filming/photography/cinematography: 9 VFX: 9 Music/score/sound: 8.5 Depth: 8.5 Logic: 7.5 Flow: 9 Action/biography/drama: 8.5 Ending: 8.5."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Decent but not great,"Confused plot with a lot of filler. This movie could easily be a short and sweet hour and a half. Decent acting; Christian Bale pulls off a good British accent. Some of the character's motivations aren't really clear and therefore their actions seem illogical at times. It doesn't go on to show Ford actually beating Ferrari. They could have skipped some of the character development of Bale's wife and kid and gone on to show Ford beating Ferrari. There's a fair bit of boring car racing scenes that started to put me to sleep a little, as long action scenes tend to do that for me. It's honestly just pretty bland subject matter so they didn't have much to work with to be fair. I don't think this really needed to be a movie, maybe just a 30 minute documentary would suffice, so I probably wouldn't recommend it but it's not the worst if you're stuck on a plane for 15 hours and can't find anything better to watch for example, it'd be fine, but at home where you've got the choice of anything I'd skip this."
Le Mans '66 (2019),this is pure art on wheels,"Even if i found the movie always already in the best part, the whole movie works in many levels. Is a racing movie, a movie about friends, a movie about how cars can make you feel alive every time you see them, hear them and follow them...is a car movie that have everything i like, even i have watched the movie in parts, i like that is both human and machine focused. Cristian bale really make you believe what he feels as ken miles, and matt damon shines as caroll shelby. Lets just say, ken miles family, carolls shelby mechanics, even the other teams make the movie good in many ways.the races are filmed so good that i never noticed when is only cristian bale and when is a stunt car.is funny dramatic and moving.and have alot of beautiful cars, and great photography.is like, soon could be one of those movies i could watch every day.makes sense that bale is now in a racing movie, after nolan movies, he was always in the lamborghinis and the tumbler racing fast, what was interesting to me is to see matt damon plays a caroll shelby that was so real that you really feel he can build a car."
Le Mans '66 (2019),Foreshadowing,"Le Mans '66"" speeds into the heart of motorsports rivalry, delivering a thrilling tale set against the iconic 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The film's standout performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale paint a vivid portrait of determination and passion. While the adrenaline-pumping racing sequences dominate, the movie's real brilliance lies in its skillful use of foreshadowing. A sense of impending tragedy looms over Ken Miles' character, adding depth and weight to the climax. But, they foreshadowed his death to much to not make a big deal out of it. I like the emotion that Matt Damon shows when he spoke to Miles son but the event that killed Ken Miles is just to short and not that great. While some clichés and pacing issues persist, the film's emotional impact and immersive storytelling make it a compelling watch for racing aficionados and casual moviegoers alike."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),Easy to watch,"An easy comedy to switch you're mind off to, it doesn't have anything super different or interesting to say and the plot moves real quick, especially at the start, but it's funny and has a heart. Ben Stiller has never really been my favourite comedic actor, and unfortunately the minders he appeared on screen I grew quite tiresome, but I guessed that was the point, since he was the antagonist. Characterisation of the other members of the dodgeball team is a little miss, and I think perhaps they could've put some more information about them each at the top. But I still think it's a fun film to watch if you're craving something simple and funny."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball...","Dodgeball is a very entertaining film and I seem to like it more every time I watch it. I'm always in disbelief watching this, because it's an over the top slapstick comedy about dodgeball, how can it be so funny! The pacing is really good and it feels like it's over in half an hour. The acting is good and Ben Stiller's character of White Goodman is easily one of the funniest movie villains of all time. The late Rip Torn is hilarious too in his role. Vince Vaughan does a fine job and Christine Taylor does alright too. This film also features a very funny credit scene before they started to become so widely used. Overall it's a very amusing way to spend an hour and a half."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),Un-ball-ievably Funny,"Dodgeball is the kind of movie I can come back to after a year and still find everything hilarious again and again. This movie is the King of sports comedy films. From the loveable goofs of Average Joe's to the over-the-top villain in Ben Stiller's White Goodman, and watching Patches throw wrenches at people under the logic of ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"". The movie delivers consistent laughs throughout and is a real feel-good comedy for all ages. Plenty of jokes the kids will get and plenty more that'll go over their heads and the adults will understand. Every time I watch this film, I seem to pick up on a new joke each time. Be sure to watch the hilarious post-credit scene with White Goodman too! It took me many views to realise it existed and it was unexpected to say the least."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),"""Nobody makes me bleed my own blood""","Golly Geesh this movie is hilarious. It so quotable and ridiculous but I loved it. I usually hate dumb comedy movies but the actor and writing had me committed to this movie. I rewatch this movie all the time. On my initial viewing, it was okay to me. But on another watch I was all in. I can't say it enough. This is hilarious. I can see if some people might not like it. Some comedies are not for everyone. But come on gotta love the 2000 comedy. Hurt every bodies feeling all the time. Did not care. Looking at the main actors you might get an idea of how the comedy might go. It gives hot chick, white chicks, and horrible bosses vibe."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),Not worth your time. Except you have a lot of time.,"First things first, I must admit something Yes, the film is funny. But I feel like everyone here is overrating it. I watched it and had 2 good laughs. 2 good laughs isnt bad at all but for a movie which is made purely for the purpose of comedy it wasn't enough for me. The dodgeball scenes are too silly for me and I can't watch them without cringing a little. There are many great movies out there, but this one isn't really it. I actually have seen this movie twice. First time was in gym class. My classmates shared my opinion, except one. My own twin. So he forced to Re- watch it. I didn't change my opinion. I would like to give this 5 stars, but I feel like that's unfair when there are movies with 5 stars that I liked even more. And I also think the overall rating should be dragged down a little. But I am just a internet guy whose opinion doesn't matter."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),A Hilarious and Inspiring Sports Comedy,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is an uproarious sports comedy that hits its target with precision. This film is a delightful blend of slapstick humor, witty dialogue, and an underdog narrative that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The film boasts a talented ensemble cast, led by Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, who deliver exceptional performances. Vaughn's relatable charm as Peter LaFleur, the struggling gym owner, provides a solid anchor for the story, while Stiller's over-the-top portrayal of White Goodman, the egotistical fitness guru, steals every scene he's in. The comedic timing and physical comedy in ""Dodgeball"" are impeccable. The gags and slapstick humor are cleverly executed, resulting in moments that will have you laughing out loud. The film's exaggerated characters and absurd situations add to the comedic charm, creating a fast-paced and entertaining experience. However, what sets ""Dodgeball"" apart is its unexpected heart. Beyond the laughs, there's an inspiring message about teamwork, perseverance, and embracing one's true self. The film manages to balance its comedic moments with genuine emotional beats, making it a well-rounded and satisfying experience. Visually, the film captures the energetic spirit of dodgeball through dynamic and engaging sports sequences.

Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),Entertaining Experience,"The film combines outrageous humor with an underdog story, creating a unique and entertaining experience. Vince Vaughn shines as Peter LaFleur, the laid-back owner of Average Joe's Gym. His deadpan delivery and witty comebacks add a perfect dose of sarcasm to the film. On the other hand, Ben Stiller's portrayal of White Goodman, the pompous owner of Globo Gym, is pure comedic genius. Stiller's over-the-top performance and larger-than-life personality make for an unforgettable antagonist. The plot revolves around Peter's desperate attempt to save his gym from foreclosure by entering a high-stakes dodgeball tournament. The tournament scenes are filled with high-energy action and slapstick comedy, keeping you engaged and laughing throughout. The supporting cast, including Rip Torn as the eccentric Patches O'Houlihan, adds even more comedic value to the film. What sets ""Dodgeball"" apart is its clever writing and memorable one-liners. The dialogue is sharp, filled with clever puns and pop culture references that will have you quoting the movie for days. The film also cleverly satirizes the fitness industry and the obsession with physical perfection. The chemistry between Vaughn and Stiller is undeniable, and their on-screen rivalry is pure gold. The comedic timing and improvisation between the two actors are spot-on, creating many laugh-out-loud moments. The supporting cast, including Christine Taylor, Justin Long, and Alan Tudyk, also deliver strong performances, adding depth to the story. While the film primarily aims for laughter, it also carries an important message about teamwork, friendship, and embracing one's true self. The story reminds us that success doesn't always come in the expected package, and that even the most unlikely heroes can emerge victorious. ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is a comedy gem that will have you rolling in the aisles. With its clever writing, memorable characters, and uproarious humor, this film is a must-watch for fans of comedy and sports movies alike. So grab your dodgeballs and get ready for a laughter-filled ride that you won't soon forget."
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),A scene stealer named Ben Stiller!,"Once you've peeled all the layers of goofball comedy that cover the heart of Ron Shelton's ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" -and as a true underdog film indeed, it's got a heart and at the right place- you get to the core of its spirit, which is the clash of two schools of gym-related philosophies: fulfillment of physical narcissism VS; male-bonding escapism, ""become a better man"" or ""be yourself and have a good time"". Ego vs. Friendship, ""Globo Gym"" vs. ""Average Joe's"". The film doesn't aim high (in a good sense) for it doesn't take much effort to root for the more relatable misfits that hang out in a dilapidated gym club... but just because you're escaping from life's daily hardships doesn't mean they won't come biting you some day. You've got to earn your freedom and a little competition never hurts. In a way, the rubber ball works as the film's existential allegory : sometimes you just can't dodge all the hits, you've got to take them and learn to hit back. The first ten minutes of the film set the tone through a hilarious commercial. You've got a cocky and arrogant successful gym franchise owner, a body and self-confidence building guru named White Goodman, played by a Ben Stiller at the top of his game. From his hair-mullet to his horseshoe moustache and his ""we're better than you"" slogan, you know this is someone who's trying to compensate past demons. In fact, he doesn't deny it himself: six years before, he was a morbidly obese loser. Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is more laid-back and amiable, so careless that he must raise 50.000 dollars to pay his mortgage and prevent what's left from his gym to be bought out by his rival. It's not even the loss that concerns him but that his buddies would lose their little haver. And what a colorful gallery of lovable schmucks! Justin Long is an awkwardly shy and clumsy high school student who joined a cheerleading team to impress his love interest, Stephen Root is an equivalent of his iconic ""Office Space"" Milton. Alan Tudyk is Steve ""Pirate"" Cowan who takes his ""being a pirate"" so seriously that it quickly ceases to be a matter of puzzlement but rather an inspirational self-acceptance model. As two of Peter's employees, there's also Joel David Moore and Chris Williams and finally, we have Christine Taylor -Stiller's wife- as Kate Veatch, an assigned tax lawyer who, despite her tremendous skills, can't join the team (the bank is sponsored by Globo Gym so it would be a conflict of interest) but something about Goodman's seduction skills inevitably led her to becoming a pivotal member of the Average Joe's team. It's one thing to pretend to read a dictionary, inflate the 'crotch' zone and pull a 'Basic Instinct' but another to fire a woman to better date her or deliver some embarrassingly bordernline-harrassment lines. In fact the only redeeming quality of Goodman is that he's so hilariously obnoxious that we enjoy laughing at his incapability to read the signs. I mean, once you've made a woman throw up in her mouth, what's left? With such a great villain, Vaughn doesn't have to force himself to be likable, not that he doesn't play it smooth either with Kate. She ultimately joins the team and after winning a regional match against Girl Scouts (the twist is hilarious), they enter the official tournament in Vegas, and gags ensues as rapidly as balls get thrown at players. And so we get the obligatory unorthodox training sessions from Patches O'Houllian, a former champion played by Rip Torn, some hilarious moments that would make any 80s baby recall the ""Simpsons"", from the classic ""you made me bleed my own blood"" to the hilarious spoof of 50s politically incorrect 50s educationals clips with a fun performance from Hank Azaria as a young Patches. Add to that an unrecognizable Missi Pyle as a foreign athlete with an impossible name, hilarious cameos from David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris or William Shatner and last but not least, some awkward interactions between other ""Office Space"" star Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the show's commentators, ""Dodgeball"" never leaves thirty seconds going without a gag or a funny line. But it all comes down to the rivalry between Vaughn and Stiller, the insecure Napoleon surrounded by thugs with the name of Blade, Laser, Blazer or Me'Chell, and the dude who's so humble and modest you don't even notice that he towers over everyone. Vaughn doesn't play Peter as a good but rather a straight man, and with all the zaniness surrounding him, he's as well-cast as the stoic and no-nonsense Bob Hoskins in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Some of his verbal interactions with Stiller are just funny because he doesn't even try to outsmart his opponent while the other tries so hard he fails lamentably. ""Dodgeball"" took me back to a bygone time where humor could allow itself to be as raunchy, vulgar and outrageous as it gets without ever making it a vital concern to be offensive to a community: the early 2000s. Movies that allowed two straight guys to make gay jokes in ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" or a blackface to be a plot element in ""Tropic Thunder"". It's fair to say that such movies would be impossible to make for there are guidelines now that infected the creative process up to the casting. Some Youtubers even conceded, while reacting to their first viewing that it was the early 2000s and I was saddened not to detect a hint of nostalgia. Maybe it's a generational thing but as a proud early Millennial, I could savor the humor of ""Dodgeball"" like a good old South Park episode for it's not just funny, it's also very smart. You earn your happy ending with laughs, heart-warming moments and clever twists. Let's hope the sequel lives up to its predecessor..."

Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004),Silly Sports Comedy Hits the Small Screen!!,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is the tale of a gym owned by an everyday sort of guy that, because of bad finances, might lose his gym to a man who runs a neighboring lucrative. This man is named White Goodman who is played by comedic genius Ben Stiller (Meet the Parents). The owner of the gym with bad finances is a man named Peter La Fleur who is played wonderfully in this movie with great dry comedic timing by Vince Vaughn (Rudy). After being informed by a bank lawyer named Kate Veatch, played nicely by Christine Taylor (Zoolander) that Peter's finances on his gym are not up enough to par to keep the gym Peter rallies a group of friends from the gym to find some ways to find the $50,000 to save his gym from faltering on the mortgage. The best idea that Peter and friends can come up with is playing competitive dodgeball with a chance to win a $50,000 pot if the team is good enough to make it all the way to make to the Las Vegas Finals an win it!! While the hilarity of the movie starts as soon as the movie begins the fun really begins as the group starts to play dodgeball!! Dodgeball is a terrific movie!! Stiller as the obnoxiously overdriven gym owner is just as funny as Peter the laid back gym owner!! Whoever picked this cast did a superb job, there's even a cameo by Jason Bateman as a color commentator for TV of the dodgeball games that Average Joe's Gym plays in - that's the name of Peter's gym team. Bateman's commentary is almost completely irrelevant, making it completely hilarious. On a side note, the uniform colors of gold and maroon picked by Average Joe's Gym were a tribute to the Hickory Huskers of the movie Hoosiers, a small fact that I learned on a retrospective about this movie a few years back. The acting is good but the comedy is the key in this film with this being a comedic movie. Rawson Marshall Thurber did a fantastic job directing a wide ranging group of talent in this comedic gem. Marshall Thurber also did a spot on job writing a purely unique story that is an original and is still fun to see to this day!! Theodore Shapiro did a nice job with the soundtrack, it supported when need be and was timely as well. Carol Ramsey did a fine job costuming all of the various characters in the movie. Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story received a PG-13 rating when it was released in 2004 so it is perfect for those 13 and up looking for a good laugh. 7 out of 10 stars!!"
Lady Ballers (2023),Hilarious! Couldn't have been created by Hollywood,"This movie is so hilarious! This is about a washed out coach that is trying to get his old career alive again, but he is struggling with the modern world. Reconnected with his old male athletes, they're competing 15 years later in the professional basketball competition. Having found a way with the assistance of his daughter and being helped by a career focused journalist, they're playing yet again for the championship. This time they are playing in the female league. Throughout the whole movie I was laughing. Having transmen play in a women competition, they're crushing all records, one after the other. Hollywood could never make a movie like this with references to the new Snowwhite movie."
Lady Ballers (2023),Trying too hard,"They tried to mock trans athletes but it's only mocking how clueless the writers are of trans athletes and sports in general. Airbud had a better storyline than this trash. When a movie tries too hard to be offensive and less time being funny, it just looks like a straight to stream type of movie. I will not be shocked when Daily Wire's movie production department goes bankrupt from making bad movie after bad movie. If they want to succeed, hire actual writers to make their movies instead of letting hacks who couldn't write a Hollywood movie script. Unless they're just using ChatGPT, which would make sense."
Lady Ballers (2023),Embarrassing and not triggering,"Pretty bad, the pacing is terrible and the movie is incredibly bloated, it is nearly two hours long. Not funny or triggering, something about trying too hard to make something triggering or offensive makes it the opposite for me. This movie also has some of the most obvious and explicit editing/audio mistakes I have ever seen in a film. I want to point out that Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing themselves admitted that the original plan for this movie was to be a documentary. They said they tried to get men to play in women's sports and failed. It turns out the fake world they have built isn't real and women's sports have rules and standards when it comes to transgender players. If you have no sense of humor and like 2000s comedies, or you are middle-aged and can't stop thinking about trans people, this movie might be for you."
Lady Ballers (2023),Made me laugh,"This is the type of movie that's gets more funny when you are watching with friends. It has several quotable lines, and my husband and I will sometimes quote lines to each other. I was worried it would be just okay, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, the acting isn't the greatest, but it's not really required for a social commentary/ commentary. TLDR will make you laugh, will make you think, and surprisingly heartfelt. The cameos of Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, and Matt Walsh especially are the highlight. Oh, and Tyler Fischer. Freaking hilarious. He made me laugh more than probably anyone."
Lady Ballers (2023),Utter rubbish,"Wow - from start to finish the acting was remarkable given the actors mental conditions - it's hard to think, let alone speak, with the disabilities that these actors clearly suffer from so painfully. I wish I had known it was ""written"" by Daily wire, or even who Daily wire was for that matter before committing that much of my life to suffer through it. Now I can see that the concept of the movie was scooped gingerly out of the Daily wire toilet, which is apparently where they find all of their best ideas about fear mongering, bigotry and division. The movie is kind of like watching a confused bloke poke the tips of his fingers together shaking his head in scared confusion. Given that this is their first direct to internet movie we must cut them some slack and give them some advice... so I gave them an extra star. Daily wire should stick to what they do well... from what I can tell this is ""making money from idiots""... but there is enough of that already in the US, so instead they should find the closest cliff and help guide evolution back in the right direction. It's almost as funny as my late Dad's Cancer."
Lady Ballers (2023),Amazing!,"It was the funniest movie since the last American Pie and way more thought provoking, with way more truth bombs than I expected. This should be watched as a family with questions answered throughout. It even contained a few truth bombs for conservatives to ponder about ourselves. If your liberal, consider skipping this because I don't believe movies should blindside you when you come for entertainment. If your liberal and open minded, you will enjoy the other side of the coin. This movie isn't for young children, as it could cause more confusion than it clears up. Watch this with some alcohol or late at night for the best results, as it is slapstick."
Lady Ballers (2023),A film so badly done it can't even hit its intended target.,"It's a poorly produced, poorly acted film where the jokes are basically Conservative grievances communicated in a funny voice and/or with a funny face but nobody has the talent of Jim Carey to pull something like that off. It's also tragically ironic that it targets trans people but wildly overshoots the mark and ends up being more of a denigration of women's sports in general than a film criticising the presence of trans women in sports. Perhaps that was the intention of the writers, but that would imply they had enough talent to pull off multiple intentions at the same. Did anyone who blatantly gave this 10/10 because of the subject matter notice this? Unsurprisingly no. It's also hard to only view this as a silly comedy when it was clearly made with hateful intent. It was made with the same attitude a bully has when telling jokes at the expense of their victims and if that's not a problem for you, well that says it all. Just an unpleasant experience all round."
Lady Ballers (2023),Its ok if you understand what your going to watch,"It was ok , had some funny moments for sure, it's kind of like an after school special from back in the 80/90's had a baby with The cannonball run movies, you'll know what I mean when you watch it. It has some moral lessons that I personally agree with, but everyone has their own opinion, I'm trying not to go there with my review. I realize this movie was done on a very small budget, so if you can get past that, and know what you're getting into you'll probably enjoy it. It's Family friendly even with the subject matter. You can tell they had fun making it and didn't take them selves serious. It's worth a watch at least once. It is what it is ."
Lady Ballers (2023),"Probably would have been funny in the 90's, but eh, not now. Just boring.","South Park made this joke a couple of years ago and it was hilarious, heck, it's still as funny as ever. However, Daily Wire made a full feature movie just about it and there are jokes better told in a certain length than try to stretch it as long as possible. Furthermore, the acting wasn't very good, the comedy in itself could've worked for a 90's movie no problem, it's just that shtick has gotten tiresome, boring, and unoriginal. The Right says the Left can't meme, yet here we are where DW made a not-so funny movie and South Park did it far better in just 20mins, or even just 1m30s if you count just that one epic scene with him and Strongwoman."
Lady Ballers (2023),A for effort,"Folks, it's a low budget movie. Literally. So let's not get excited thinking we have a 'knock it out of the park' classic on our hands. It was amusing and I appreciated that it wasn't super 'Christian'. That wasn't the point. The point was to make fun of an absurd twilight zone we are in with men in women's sports. Acting was fine, script was fine. The ending was on point. Honestly it was a relief to have a chuckle at this nonsense. That's the point of a comedy, to be a little offensive and true and get a laugh. I haven't watched much comedy lately because it's just so redundant. It's worth a watch, but manage your expectations."
Cars (2006),Uhhhh... HECK YES,I was born in 2011 and I first saw it when I was 3 or 2 can't remember. And I just wanted to say I still freaking LOVE this film and the animation is amazing. This might possibly be my favorite Pixar movie and maybe (I know this sounds insane) better than Toy Story (my opinion) freaking Toy Story! It's plot is funny and apparently is kind of like rocky? (This is insane because I'm 12 and have never seen rocky I know I'm sorry). The Cars look great and even though I'm not a 2000s kid it's still part of my childhood. Mater is adorable and hilarious. McQueen is super selfish at the beginning but he grows out of it and then is really caring and even gets a girlfriend! (Bro got that McQueen rizz) Great movie and a Pixar classic that is a masterpiece in my heart and I love it. Parents there is not really that much to say about this because while there are a couple if adult jokes your kids won't understand and they'll be fine. There's like two not even violent parts. If your kids can handle Other kids movies they can most certainly handle this. This is a great Pixar masterpiece and in my top 20 favorite films! 9/10.
Cars (2006),Cars,"So the shiny, red, ""Lightning McQueen"" is determined to make it to distant California to compete in the ""Piston Cup"". Along the way he stops off in the small town of ""Radiator Springs"" where he manages to tear up their road. His punishment? Well they have a giant tarmac laying machine, so he has to get it to resurface the road before he can be on his merry way. This isn't an easy task, and in order to finish that job he's going to have to find some allies. That's not so easy for this cocky and tunnel-visioned character, but as he gradually starts to listen, learns and make friends, he realises that there is much more to life than this one race! There's a gently bubbling moral to the story - learning to value the more important things in life like friendship, teamwork and self-reliance, and the characterisations of ""Sally"" - a lithe and stylish Porsche and ""Mater"" - a tow truck that looks like it's held together by Wrigley's and good will, help drum this message into ""Lightning' and the watching audience. There's plenty of colourful and vibrant action alongside quite a bit of humour (and puns!) from the writing to keep it going and although I found this a bit wordy - and perhaps just a little too focussed for internal (US) consumption, it's still an enjoyable start to what I assume will become quite a flexible franchise."
Cars (2006),Nostalgic/Nostalgia.,"Wow, I Found So Many Bad Reviews On The 2nd Movie. I Thought These Movies, Including Cars 2 Were Amazing. I Used To Watch This & Cars 2 When I Was Little, I Loved Them A-LOT, & I Still Do. But Cars 3 Was The Best Trilogy Of This Franchise. Lightning McQueen Is A Brave Race-Car. Tow Mater The Tow-Truck Is The Best Character. Sally Carrera Is Nice. Flo Is Not The Best, Just Decent. Ramone Is Amazing, Especially When He Changes His Paint Every 1nce In Awhile. Luigi & Guido Are Good Characters. Fillmore Awesome. Sarge Is Not The Best, But Great. Sheriff Is Amazing. Doc Is A Good Character (R. I. P). Red The Firetruck Is Relatable, When He's Shy. Lizzie Is Funny. Frank Is Hilarious, Especially When He Chases Down Lightning McQueen & Mater At My Favorite Part. Chick Hicks Makes A Good Villain. The King Is While Not The Best, But Amazing. The Tuner Cars Boost, DJ, Wingo, & Snot-Rod Are Badass. This Movie, & Cars 2 Were Nostalgic/Nostalgia. I Think Cars 3 Was The Best Cars Movie. Yes, I Think A 3-Quel Coming Out At Age 10 Is Better Than The Childhoods. Anyways, That's My Review. I'll Review The Other 2, Soon. RATING: Amazing Movie (100/100)."
Cars (2006),"""The Film That Made Me Who I Am""","Ok so just hear me out. Disney Pixar Cars is my all time favorite Disney Movie, yes it's not the best but it's still a great film and a fun one at best. It has a great story with Lighting McQueen who is a hot shot rookie racer who comes across an abandoned town and has to get used to the scenery around it which makes him miss his race, but in the end he learns a lot and it makes him realize that there is more to racing than just winning. The animation is beautiful and the characters are extremely likable and relatable. But the reason why I love this movie so much is because it made me who I am, and that's a race car driver. When I was young, this movie was a huge part of my childhood, watching it a lot with my family, playing with the toys, video games, and going to Disneyland to ride the Cars ride. This movie means so much to me as it taught me many things about not just racing, but good human qualities like being a good friend, learning from the best and accepting change. This movie also got me into my biggest hobby and that's racing. I became a huge NASCAR fan after the movie when I learned more about it and I instantly became hooked. But the biggest this movie has done is that it made me an actual race car driver. Racing has been a huge part of my life and it's been a dream of mine to become a race driver, and this movie did just that. It inspired me to become a driver, learn more about cars and try to follow your dreams of becoming a champion. Overall, I'm so grateful that this movie has done for me in the long run, as it made me who I am today. Cars is indeed a great film to watch especially for kids and families alike and this movie crosses the finish line and is a winner to everyone who watches it! And always remember, there is more to racing than just winning, and without your friends, your trophy is just an empty cup. Ka Chow!"
Cars (2006),Great Beginning to the Series,"This is an outstanding instalment to begin the series for everyone to watch and really enjoy. The crew did a fine job with the storyline. The storyline had it all. The cat selection was sensational. They committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. This instalment reveals to viewers the true definitions of multiple specific aspects of life that can help anyone through the difficulties that they may be facing. My life has always been real difficult. Whatever I try to do about it, it does not work. This is a spectacular instalment to start off an astonishing series for all viewers to watch and enjoy."
Cars (2006),I liked it and I disliked it,"For most of my reviews, I have plenty of things to say but I really don't how much to say about this because I just think there qualities but is has so much little problems taking it down I didn't like the first half, it was screaming right at you're face that its made for children. A cocky main protagonist and an antagonist and a lot of those children's movie cliche you can think. The side characters weren't really anything special and so is radiator springs plus McQueen is such a jerk for a long time that makes the first half just plain out the opposite of enjoyable. The 2nd half gets much better but it's still isn't Pixar level good. McQueen isn't a jerk anymore but his love for that blue car isn't really fleshed out and their chemistry isn't anything special. I thought the ending was pretty wholesome though Rating: 6.7/10."
Cars (2006),If you keep talking to yourself people will think you're crazy. I wasn't talking to you,"McQueen, a young person who's currently really popular, and doesn't respect his elders or history, leading to themes things changing over time, appreciating what you have now, and acknowledging that some things were better before they changed, of course has to learn it's not all about winning and to let go of his ego. When we meet him, he is taking credit for others' help, and not treating the equivalent of service workers well, as he himself is a celebrity with lots of fans, like a sports star. He gets community service. This also has more empathy for immigrants than A Bug's Life, from the same studio. By now, you know what Pixar brings to the table: emotionally resonant story, talented voice actors, memorable characters, detailed and highly effective animation that uses color and lighting really well, jokes for adults and ones for kids, very exciting action, and a fun world - here, all people and various other living creatures, including bugs and farm animals, are cars and other vehicles. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10."
Cars (2006),Surprisingly relevant today,"This film has its flaws but it's still a very solid film and a childhood classic for most people. The part I most appreciate about this film after watching it at an older age is the theme of old ideas, places and even people being replaced with more modern alternatives. A main plot point of the film is that route 66 was once a place full of life and offered the cars a place socialise and enjoy driving through, until it was eventually replaced by an interstate that just made the journey a bit quicker, but simultaneously lost all of the social enjoyment the drive would once have. This plot point in a way mirrors the world we live in today. It reminded me about blockbusters, which was a tangible place to search for films and socialise, and how it was gradually taken over by streaming services and eventually shut down. The same thing is happening with shops and restaurants, where most people want to have things ordered online and to their doorstep instead of going to the place itself. While these modern alternatives might be easier and more ideal, are we losing what made these activities so enjoyable in the first place? ""Cars didn't drive on it to make good time, they drove on it to have a great time"" I feel like cars has surprisingly aged very well, and each time I watch it, I find the route 66 aspect of the film more relatable and very relevant, even if that wasn't the pure intention of the film. Each time I watch it, it gets better. With all this being said I did watch it on Disney+"
Cars (2006),Speeding into Hearts,"Wow, where do I even begin with Cars (2006)? This movie exceeded my expectations in every way possible and left me feeling so incredibly entertained and satisfied. Pixar has once again proven that they are masters of storytelling and animation. When I first heard about Cars, I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical. How could a movie featuring only vehicles, with no human characters, keep me engaged for a full two hours? But Pixar managed to do just that, and more. Director John Lasseter's attention to detail is truly remarkable. Every car and truck in the movie becomes a unique character with its own personality. The way they bend and gesture in ways that are true to their construction is just incredible. It's these small details that make the world of Cars so immersive and believable. And speaking of the world, the story itself is filled with charm and heart. Yes, it may contain a well-traveled theme, but it's delivered in such a way that it feels fresh and meaningful. I found myself genuinely caring about Lightning McQueen's journey and rooting for him every step of the way. Now, I'm not a racing fan by any means, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. You don't need to be a racing enthusiast to appreciate the story and the characters. The film goes beyond the world of racing and delves into themes of self-discovery, friendship, and the importance of slowing down and enjoying life. It's a message that resonated with me, and I'm sure it will resonate with many others as well. Visually, Cars is a feast for the eyes. The animation is stunning, and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. The scenery is so beautifully rendered that it's hard to believe it's not real. From the reflections on the cars to the weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk, every little detail has been meticulously crafted. It's a visual spectacle that left me in awe. But impressive visuals alone are not enough to make a great movie. Thankfully, Cars delivers on all fronts. The characters are well-developed, and the story is engaging. Pixar took the time to give us a movie that is not just visually stunning, but also emotionally resonant. They didn't succumb to the pressure of making a shorter film to cater to shorter attention spans. Instead, they stayed true to their vision and created a movie that is both entertaining and meaningful. Cars started off with a disadvantage in my eyes, but it quickly won me over. It made me care about its characters and their journey. It made me reflect on my own life and the importance of slowing down and enjoying the journey. It made me want to take a road trip and explore the unknown. It made me appreciate the scenic route. In the end, Cars is a testament to Pixar's ability to create movies that go beyond entertainment. It's a movie that makes you care about something other than yourself, even if just for a little while. It's a movie that reminds us of the power of storytelling and the magic of animation. Pixar has once again made it look simple, but we all know that creating a movie as wonderful as Cars takes a tremendous amount of talent and hard work. I can confidently give Cars a rating of 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story and breathtaking animation."
Cars (2006),A favourite in our household,I have watched this movie countless times since it's release and I am still not sick of it yet. When my daughter was born we introduced her to it and she requested AGAIN AGAIN. Even after all those agains I could again and again still which says a lot about the quality of the movie. All the characters are great and work really well together. Owen Wilson as the stuck up McQueen is perfect for this role. The story is pretty good and it's funny to see the cars world vs the human world. There are some questions that have occurred to me over the watchings like where do baby cars come from. But I will ask an adult about that later. For now I will just recommend this again and again.
Chariots of Fire (1981),"Two men, two worlds, one goal","The movie is based on the duality of its two main characters, who are both giving it their all to win the Olympic gold medal. Harold Abrahams faces an internal conflict, he runs to overcome his identity, he wants to be known as a runner rather than as a Jew. Eric Liddell, on the other hand, knows and accepts exactly who he is and where he stands, he runs to further embrace his faith and honour his Creator. Despite the major differences in their background, their mentality and their state of mind, it's clear that they are both decent, virtuous men, products of a bygone era and that could explain why I found it hard to relate with them and lost interest fairly quickly. Even though I wasn't familiar with the real life events, the predictable outcome didn't help in that regard either. The highlight of the film is Vangelis' wonderful music and the main reason the opening scene remains ever so iconic, his Oscar was well-deserved. The running scenes are well crafted, though I couldn't help but laugh with Eric's running style. Britain looks as green and as beautiful as ever. The movie succeeds in depicting nicely both the time (early '20s) and the place (the atmosphere of Cambridge in particular)."
Chariots of Fire (1981),A great film of international and personal rivalry in sport.,"A great film of international and personal rivalry in sport. You're genuinely interested in the two different athletes and how they relate to each other, why they run. The soundtrack is pretty memorable too. I really did enjoy this movie a lot. It sort of grows on you and by the time we get to the Olympics it really has picked up. The costumes, production design help take you back to the 1920s. There were a few small details and inventions which I had a gripe with but some artistic license I guess is what you expect in a historical film. I'd recommend this film to people of all ages, regardless of their interest in sport or not."
Chariots of Fire (1981),Handsome British drama,"These British films that end up winning Best Picture always end up feeling so out of place. If I were transported back to before the ceremony, my guess on winner would probably have been Atlantic City or On Golden Pond, just based on the Academy's recent proclivity to awarding films with big movie stars in films that focused mostly on performances by those stars. A film about characters overcoming obstacles to win a sports event, especially one with such a focus on one of its main character's devotion to his Christianity, feels as out of place as A Man for all Seasons was. The film is really about Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), whose funeral bookends the film, and Eric Liddel (Ian Charleson), but we get a curious focus on both Aubrey Montague (Nicholas Farrell) and Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers) at the same time. Lord Lindsay does something important later for Liddel, but there's a fair amount of screentime dedicated to both of the latter two characters despite none of the actual dramatics being about them. Anyway, all four are amateur runners of the British Empire. All but Liddel are students at Cambridge, while Liddel is a noted rugby player who takes up running as his passion in preparation for the 1924 Olympics. The central character beats are that Abrahams is a Jew in a time and place where antisemitism was still accepted in the upper crust of society and that Liddel is a devoted Christian (raised on a Chinese mission and dedicated to returning to it) who has to choose between his dedication to his God and his dedication to his athletic pursuits. I do think the film is a good one, but I see both of these, as presented in the film, as making mountains out of molehills. Abrahams is enrolled in Cambridge and not barred from anything he wants to do, just subjected to the occasional snide comment about his Jewishness while never denied anything. Liddel faces no conflict between his faith and his athletic competitions until late in the film, and it's introduced and solved within minutes. I know that the producer, David Puttnam, was looking for a story about men who would not yield to outside pressure to violate their beliefs (in the vein of A Man for All Seasons), but this is small beans. Anyway, the story is about the handful of men pushing themselves to their limits in order to win their athletic competitions. Liddel has a great moment where he's pushed to the ground near the start of the race, gets up, and then pushes himself to his absolute limits to win. Harold watches this race and feels the need to enlist the aid of Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a running coach, a decision that makes the deans of Cambridge none too happy in a scene that could have been hard cut out of the film and no one would have noticed. It does have an ironic coda later, but it should be noted that their protestations have nothing to do with Harold's Jewishness and everything to do with his hiring a professional coach, and not even Harold brings up the idea that the excuse is a screen for some sort of motive against his ethnicity and religion. Instead, he goes off and starts seeing the singer Sybil (Alice Krige), who adores him. Of course, the film is a multi-year journey as they prepare for the Olympics, and the Olympics dominate the final third of the film as they go to Paris, meet the Prince of Wales, the eventual Edward VIII, (David Yelland), and Liddel has his moment of strength when the 100-meter heat is scheduled for a Sunday, and he refuses to race on a Sunday. The scene around the British legation, including the Prince of Wales, trying to pressure Liddel into racing on Sunday despite his beliefs, is a good one for sure, but the obstacle is introduced and dispatched (by Lord Lindsay) so quickly that it almost feels like an afterthought rather than a central dramatic tenet of the film. The dramatics are where the movie doesn't succeed very well, but as a portrait of two men pushing themselves to the physical extreme, it's kind of great. The exhaustion of the effort, the passion put into it, the sacrifices made are all wonderfully demonstrated and dramatized on screen. Liddel's real central drama isn't around running on Sunday but in conflict with his sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) who thinks that Eric is dedicated too much time to his training instead of his work as a mission in Scotland (before he goes back to China, of course), as well as Harold in conflict with Sybil and Sam, his efforts never quite being good enough for the latter but taking him away from the former. It's also an interesting portrait of a time when post-modernism was taking hold in culture but the cultural institutions hadn't embraced it yet. The sense of traditionalism was still strong, as evidenced by people like the Master of Trinity College (John Gielgud), but the dedication to the concept of nationhood was already fraying, as evidenced by the early interaction with WWI veterans, scarred by the war. It's a handsome film that can't quite bring its central dramatics to the heights of something like, yes, A Man for All Seasons, a story about a man who put his life on the line for his beliefs and paid for it compared to a film about a young man who put his athletic career on the line for his beliefs, and then found a way around it. It works more as a portrait than as a dramatic retelling of the events around the British running team at the 1924 Olympics, but that portrait is really quite good. Still, its win at the Oscars feels so out of place."
Chariots of Fire (1981),Holds your attention,"It is the 1924 Paris Olympics. Who will represent Great Britain? The decision will not only be based on athletic abilities but social standing and religion. Everyone has his or her agenda from the promoters to the runners themselves. In the end, compromises must be made but for the final chosen there can be no compromise to win. This is a movie that holds your attention on several levels. Many of the actors are easily recognizable but they do not overshadow the characters they represent. The scenery is switched from Scotland countryside to Cambridge, and France (actually shot in England). Of course, as depicted in the cover picture the most notable is the run along the beach (West Sands Beach, St Andrews, Scotland, UK.) Then the music, most noticeable in the beach scenes but permeated the movie will stay with you for years (Original music by Vangelis.) The story is based on true events with scriptwriter Colin Welland bringing what would just be facts to life making you feel that you are back in the time and taking part in the race."
Chariots of Fire (1981),Ephemeral Sports Spectacle Receives a Visual and Musical Overhaul,"With its remarkable cinematography, authentic period production design, innovative musical score, and stellar performances, ""Chariots of Fire"" appears, at first glance, to be a well-deserving recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Yet, when you peel back the layers, turning a small slice of sports history into a grandiose cinematic affair feels like a rather feeble excuse for making a feature film. Let's be honest; an event like the 1924 Olympics is about as ephemeral as they come. Even in its time, the achievements of the central figures, British track and field stars Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (portrayed by Ian Charleson), hardly qualify as legendary. While Abrahams did secure a win in the 100-meter race and Liddell claimed victory in a group event for the 400 meters, both men participated in other races during the Olympics and didn't always finish first. Oddly enough, the film's script conveniently glosses over this fact. Nevertheless, ""Chariots of Fire"" manages to weave a compelling narrative that momentarily distracts you from the realization that you're watching a movie about a somewhat forgettable footnote in sports history. Between the two protagonists, Abrahams emerges as the more intriguing character. As a Jewish student at Cambridge facing subtle discrimination, he takes up running to prove his worth to his country despite the disdain from some stuffy faculty members (the legendary John Gielgud shines in his role as a prejudiced academic). Liddell, a Scottish Christian fundamentalist, experiences a more internal struggle as he grapples with the compatibility of his faith and competition. The pinnacle of conflict arrives when he refuses to run the 100 meters due to it falling on a Sunday. The issue finds resolution when a teammate graciously gives up his spot in the 400 meters. Apart from a scene where Liddell bests Abrahams in a pre-Olympics race, the two protagonists share limited interaction. The romantic subplot involves singer Sybil Gordon (played by Alice Krige), whose role essentially boils down to being a glorified cheerleader for Abrahams, who, let's face it, wrestles with significant angst. It's worth noting that the film's creators mixed up the character of Sybil with Sybil Evers, who later became Abrahams' real-life wife. Ian Holm portrays the other enthusiastic cheerleader in Abrahams' corner, Sam Mussabini, his highly competent trainer. Director Hugh Hudson took a bold gamble by enlisting Vangelis to compose the film's score. The music, though anachronistic for the period, manages to work wonders. The iconic opening scene on the beach, with runners synchronized to Vangelis's synth score, remains etched in cinematic history. Last but not least, the film's production design, replete with magnificent costumes and painstakingly recreated historical settings, particularly the 1924 Olympics, stands out for its impeccable attention to detail and authenticity."
Chariots of Fire (1981),It was okay.,"Still I give it a 6 and not a 5, because it does have some things going for it. The wonderful and unique soundtrack by Vangelis for example. And then there is also good acting and great cinematography. There's always something nice for the eyes to see or the ears to hear. However the characters seem to be missing something and feel bland. The story sounds good and inspiring in theory and it isn't bad, it's just that it was simply too stretched out and predictable. I found myself watching the remaining time a lot and asking myself just when the story will make some interesting points or manages to make me invested... sadly it didn't. With all the good reviews and awards this movie received, I just hoped for some more. I'll still say go watch it, as maybe I'm an exception here. It's still worth a look."
Chariots of Fire (1981),Another Time,"Others more talented than I have analyzed this film to the nth degree. They come at it from an example of pro-Christianity to the foibles of a world where we are controlled by such things. I also read that there are numerous inaccuracies in this film, concerning the two principle players. A little bit of Hollywood. But the problem is that the Hollywood diminishes the effect of the film, in my opinion. If the guy knew well ahead that his race was going to be on a Sunday, then the business of a last minute decision is bogus. Also, there is a degree of generosity given to the Olympic committee that simply would not have taken place. It is about courage to an extent, but I hesitate to give it too much credit. If you buy into a religion then buy into it. Don't make these guys martyrs because they can't run a race. No one will die. No one's life will be destroyed. They continue to have the adulation of their fans. I think the only part that bothered me was the snooty Oxford guys and their anti-semitism, enjoying the challenges of the Jewish guy."
Chariots of Fire (1981),Chariots of Fire,"The opening bars of the Oscar-winning Vangelis score coupled with the shot of the athletes running along the beach, barefoot, at St. Andrews is amongst the most iconic opening scenes from any film, but somehow the rest of this strays all too often into mediocrity thereafter. It tells the story of two British athletes who strove to thrive at the Olympiad in Paris in 1924. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) comes from a Lithuanian Jewish background. Who is welcomed to Cambridge University, but never quite accepted. The other is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian who comes from missionary stock and who believes that he must serve God before himself - and that includes not running any races on the Sabbath. Both of these men have considerable athletic skills, and the story intertwines their efforts to get to the Games, whilst both must deal with their differing priorities and challenges. It's this middle portion of the film, the prologued character development phase, that all plods along too slowly. It has too little pace and too many characters, and that just drags the film down. The last fifteen minutes liven up considerably though, not just with the events on the track - but amongst those determined to ensure that the whole team attains success making sacrifices and compromises along the way. It has a classy look to it, the costumes and settings are top drawer, but I found the leading performances rather disjointed and at over two hours long, I did struggle to stay engaged."
Chariots of Fire (1981),"Never run on empty, only on full.","Still as amazing a sleeper of a period drama over 40 years since I first saw this upon the original release. It's still a genuine sleeper, the surprise hit of the year, winning the Academy Award over several blockbusters and artistic hits. Today, it's best known for the unique musical score written by Vangelis, perhaps simple to certain ears but so much more when you hear it in context with the story. It's 1924, and a promising young group of British athletes are preparing for the Olympics. The film focuses on two, Ben Cross and Ian Charleson, with slightly more focus on Cross who is Jewish and faces subtle anti-Semitism everywhere he goes. Much praise went to Ian Holm, receiving the film's only acting Oscar nomination for his role as Cross's stern but devoted coach. No nonsense in his efforts to see Cross go the distance as a top notch runner, it's a very commanding performance that is filled with subtlety. Also important to the story (and beating Holm at the Oscars) is John Gielgud as one of the top dogs at the university Cross and Charleson attend. It's the type of role he could probably play in his sleep, but he gets every detail right, creating another unforgettable performance. As a drama of determined discipline and loyalty to their dreams, this film is practically perfect, including several terrific Gilbert and Sullivan performances. Some familiar faces, not well known at the time, makes another highlight, and the tension rises through early competition, training sessions and finally the Olympics themselves, nearly a century ago. By the time this film is over, you'll be getting chills every time the theme music is heard, getting more emotional each time especially since it is altered throughout depending on the intensity of what's happening."
Chariots of Fire (1981),"Ordinary movie, but very interesting","This movie is about two runners who are running a sprint at 1924, Paris Olympic Games. It's veru emotionnal because with one runner, we cas see how religion affects his life. This movie also shows how religion can be a strength for him. I think it's quite good because, this film reflects two sports identities. Two different reasons for running but only one goal. We also saw the competition, the work, the sacrifies, the excitement etc. In the sport world. In overall I liked it but it's not a film I recommend and that I will go to see at the cinema, becauseit's an old movie and it's not an amazing movie, it's just a good film. Yes for me, it's a boring film but realistic so for that, on a scale of 0 to 10 I give this film a 5."
She's the Man (2006),What a movie!,"In my 18 years on this earth, I have watched countless great movies. This movie, oh, this movie changed me. I wish I could take back the 1 hour and 45 minutes I wasted on this movie. I wish I could go back to the person I was before this movie. This movie single-handedly broke me. I have watched terrible movies before but this one takes the cake. I thought I could handle it because, hello Channing Tatum, but even with all of his hotness, the movie was still so hard to watch. The main character made me want to skin my scalp and staple it back on. Please save yourself the trouble and don't watch it. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy."
She's the Man (2006),Great movie!,"When I started this movie, I was extremely bored and just watched whatever YouTube had for free. This made me really judgy and I hated it within the first 10 minutes because it was predictable and boring and, let's be honest, the coach at Cornwall had a point. But as the movie went on, I began loving the characters and, well, Channing Tatum was in the movie and well...👌. The character's were so funny and didn't feel disconcerted from the movie. You'll be cheering for the two main characters as they fall in love, you'll cheer as they play soccer(and I don't even like soccer), etc. Long story short, the movie was sweet, hilarious, and yes it was predictable like all romance movies but you still love it anyway. I recommend this movie."
She's the Man (2006),A bit disappointing but still fun,"She's the Man is based on a very silly concept that it uses well to create some fun, but it does feel a little too stretched to really impress. The highlight of the film is the fantastic lead performance from Amanda Bynes, who really shines as both Viola and Sebastian. It's a performance full of great comedy and physical acting, and it really brings the film together. There are some solid supporting performances, even if they are all a little overacted, with Channing Tatum as the stand out. As mentioned the story is very silly but fun, nothing more than that really. It maybe could have been taken further and the concept used to create a bit more chaos and fun. It's all very predictable but it works. Like a lot of movies from this era, it does have a good feel and tone to it which is welcome, and it does make for a light hearted and breezy film. Overall I was expecting a little more from She's the Man, but it is still fun nonetheless."
She's the Man (2006),A Fun Film,"This film begins with a high school student named ""Viola"" (Amanda Bynes) being informed that her chances of winning a college scholarship for soccer have been destroyed due to the sport being cut from the program. Still wanting to be able to demonstrate her skills to college recruiters, Viola then goes to the boys' soccer coach, but he not only dismisses her request, but also humiliates her in the process as well. Even worse, her boyfriend ""Justin"" (Robert Hoffman) also joins in the laughter. Infuriated by this, Viola immediately breaks up with him. Not long afterward, she learns that her twin brother ""Sebastian"" (James Kirk) is secretly heading out of town for two weeks and--since he is living with their dad and is set to attend a different school not far away--she decides to masquerade as a guy and try out for the boys' soccer team there instead. Obviously, this subterfuge presents enough challenges on its own, but what she doesn't count on is the fact that Sebastian's girlfriend ""Monique"" (Alexandra Breckenridge) is looking for Sebastian and has a habit of appearing out of nowhere at the worst possible times. Neither does Viola factor into the equation the possibility that she might fall in love with one of the soccer players named ""Duke"" (Channing Tatum). Or for that matter, that Duke might have a crush on the prettiest girl in school named ""Olivia Lennox"" (Laura Ramsey)--who quickly becomes attracted to Viola's version of Sebastian. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I was expecting this film to be nothing more than a remake of the movie ""Just One of the Guys"" which came out 19 years earlier. And as such, I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as entertaining. To my delight, I turned out to be quite wrong, as I found this movie to be just as good with Amanda Bynes putting in a really good performance all along the way. That being said, I can understand it if there are some viewers who prefer ""Just One of the Guys"" over this as it came out first and seems more original. Be that as it may, I found this movie to be quite entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
She's the Man (2006),Typical Teen RomCom from the early 00s.,"I've heard this movie mentioned by a few friends as very fun, and I'm thinking that is more the nostalgia speaking. It is fairly pleasant and mildly entertaining, I'll admit but ""very fun"" it is not. It's also definitely a product of its time, completely corny and predictable with some questionable jokes. There are definitely better movies to watch in that genre from that era so if you have to be picky about what you're watching I would say you can skip She's The Man, you wont' be missing much. But if you need something in the background you don't really have to think about much, knock yourself out."
She's the Man (2006),Fun! Better than you think!,"Within the plethora of teen movies of this period, it's easy to dismiss and overlook them. However, I was pleasantly surprised after watching this film at how fun this movie is. It's well written and is exactly what it should be - a fun, tangled case of mixed up identities. The performances of the actors, including Bynes and Tatum, is fun too and there are some genuinely funny moments. Finally, it's refreshing that there are actually some queer moments that aren't shied away from - from Sebastian/Viola slapping girls on the asses, to Viola's gay best friend, Paul, canoodling with his own football player at the end. It was good film!"
She's the Man (2006),"""...and when I close my eyes, I see you for who you truly are, which is UUUG-LAY.""","Entertaining comedic timing from Amanda Bynes, effortlessly shining in the lead role as Viola and showcasing her versatile comedic range. Her impersonation of Viola's twin brother, Sebastian, is silly and really funny (the fake Jamaican accent she uses to sound cool had me laughing so much). Channing Tatum is equally awesome in a more subtle supporting comedy role as the roommate-friend turned love interest, sharing a sweet chemistry with Bynes in her dual role. The sexism and gender politics in sports theme is well crafted through the storyline. Also, big praise to whoever hand-selected this film's brilliant soundtrack; meshes seamlessly with each scene's vibe and atmosphere. A must-watch sports rom-com from the 2000s and one of Bynes BEST films! A good pick too if you're looking for a feel-good film to watch."
She's the Man (2006),Amanda Bynes is a comic genius,"Almost all child actors have problems because of the crazy lifestyle of working as an adult with adults, so it's good that she's retreated to finding a normal life away from Hollywood. But in addition to Shirley Temple, Bynes has been my favorite young actor. Amanda Bynes is a comic genius. She plays everything moment by moment. If you listen to the script, you can imagine how the majority of actors would say the line. What she does with each line is deliciously funny and original. All of the other actors are great, too. The writing is well thought out, cute the way they incorporating Shakespearean names into this modern homage to Twelfth Night."
She's the Man (2006),Absolutely loved it!,"I've watched this movie 3 times in 3 different stages of my life and still find it funny and romantic. Yes, it's corny at times but still cool and enjoyable. A real comedy that makes me laugh outright. It's a movie that will definitely make you happy and put a smile on your face. Don't think this is a movie for teenagers only. It's great to watch with your family or even on a date or even on your own. Very fast paced, not a dull moment and filled with different characters though some probably with exaggerated acting but still not annoying. Recommend to watch. I won't be surprised if I will watch it again and still find it funny."
She's the Man (2006),Garbage,The plot and character intro lasts all of 9 minutes. The only time I laughed was at how bad everything is. Pointless scenes and forced jokes that just don't land it's just embarrassing. Seriously go watch Just One of the Guys.
Rocky (1976),Classic Movie,"Great Movie, the film has many great moments, including Rockys unique training method, Rockys relationship with Adrian which gets better as the movie moves along, the fight itself is superb to watch, Thou Rockys style of taking so many punches isn't good, Bill Conti's music is superb and adds to the scenes, big praise on Stallones performance and story, Carl weather's is superb as Apollo and alot like Muhammad Ali, and the perfect showman, Rockys attitude outside the ring is very commandable, he is loyal to people he is close with, relationship with Mickey very up and down especially losing his locker, then Mickey trains him very well."
Rocky (1976),Pure Cinema,"I watched it again last night, this time on some Italian channel, dubbed. I can't recall how many times this masterpiece blew my mind but I recall very well the first time I had seen it, a decade after its release, on TV... And before yesterday, 9 years ago, I had seen it on DVD with who was my beloved at the time, for whom it was a first. Why are these even worthy of mention, you might ask. I do think it is important for us to be able to enjoy a film at very different stages of our lives. When you're a kid, you'll look up to Rocky as the young man you wanna be. When you're of middle age, you'll understand better how Burt Young's character felt. And probably when we are much older, we may identify with Mikey who was lamenting about being 76, still chasing a chance, a dream. John G. Avildsen is the guy who set the standards for popularizing the most precious emotions. You just cannot neglect Karate Kid or Rocky. These are more than films. They are citadels of audiovisual culture. Watch Rocky, and then just look at a pic from some recent Sylvester Stallone movie. The difference of quality and grace is abyssmal. It just blows your mind to see that, the man who rose to fame with such a gem is today appearing in ""products"" that are literally nothing compared to Rocky. I won't say I don't understand it. Nor do I condemn Sly's current path. Maybe it's inevitable. Maybe it's normal that, after Rocky, you can never reach so high. There's so much to say about this movie. Yet, we don't even need to put our feelings into words. The score does it for us. The climax we reach by the ending, the victory of the guy who on paper actually lost the confrontation, the love and affection he has for the woman he has gained the heart of along the way... Rocky is not just a movie. It's that sports game you can watch again and again, knowing the result, just out of your desire to relive the emotions leading to it. There are several movies we can choose as ""the best ever"". And each have their power points. But to each, you can approach also in a pedantic manner and argue this or tat could have been handled better. Borrowing an analogy of Alan Watts, only to apply it to this masterpiece: ""Have you ever seen a misshaped wave? Or a wrong cloud? There are no such things. They come with nature exactly as they are supposed to."" To me, Rocky is to cinema what a wave or a cloud is to nature. It's perfect. Just perfect, and impossible to imagine in a different way of existing. What we feel for the protagonist of the film is the exact same as what we feel for the brains and souls behind it. Respect, respect, respect."
Rocky (1976),"A Classic, but a very average film","Heard about this film for a very long time but hasent been able to watch yet until today. Heard it was gonna be good and it should, due to the very high rating on imdb. Heard it is a must watch, if your into film. Early into the film, I directly felt that i really don't understand the very high rating at all and i don't understand whats so special about it. Nothing unique to it. Pretty bad manuscript aswell at some moments. Sylvester Stallone does a average performance in his role, of some regarded to be one of his best ever. A extremely boring and slow film. Filming starts pretty bad and shaky, but gets much better the longer into the film. Good soundtrack. A Classic, but a very average film. Watchable, but do not expect too much."
Rocky (1976),The legend... ROCKY,"Sylvester Stallone at his best, an easy but exciting plot, a controversial and borderline character. This is the recipe that makes Rocky one of the most watched, famous and appreciated films of all time. As I often say for masterpieces, raise your hand if you've never seen Rocky, look around you won't find anyone. A semi-desperate Italian boxer who scrapes by on fake jobs, in a squalid house with 2 turtles for company, will find himself facing the world heavyweight champion in Philadelphia in front of his people. Well, a sort of male Cinderella, a dream that comes true and that will change the life of both the character and the interpreter Sly forever. There's also boxing but that's marginal... Top film!"
Rocky (1976),Going the Distance,"Sylvester Stallone wanted to make it in Hollywood, but he couldn't get cast in anything other than...stuff he'd rather forget he was ever near. So, he wrote his own screenplay, heavily influenced by Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront, and got it funded by the independent producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, and they hired the largely unremarkable young filmmaker John Avildsen to direct. The result is a tender character piece that, especially when combined with its rousing score by Bill Conti, ends up a fun, touching sports film that never loses sight of what it's about: its central character. Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is semi-pro boxer with little technique but a lot of heart who wins more than he loses, but he can't get any particularly good fights since no one will manage him or really believes in him. He's alone in the world, trying to get the mousy, shy girl who works in the pet shop, Adrian (Talia Shire) to laugh at his corny jokes while working as a leg breaker for the small time loan shark Tony (Joe Spinelli). He has no real friends, the closest being Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young) who spends most of his time trying to convince Rocky to get him a job with Tony to get him out of his meat packing job. Essentially, the first hour of the film is a portrait of Rocky, his lonely life, and his early courtship with Adrian. It's a warm portrait of a bum, a guy who has something within him to make something of himself, but who has never applied himself quite right, as Mickey (Burgess Meredith) ends up saying, that he has wasted his potential on a little life in service of someone like Tony. He's also kind of dumb with the kinds of street smarts that at least allow him to acknowledge that he's made bad decisions in the past about who he had spent time with, as he outlines in a little rambling speech to a girl hanging out with the wrong crowd. He gets his chance, though, when the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has spent too much time and too much money prepping for a bicentennial fight that is at the risk of cancellation because his opponent has a broken hand. With only five weeks to train, he can't get anyone ranked to commit to the fight, so he and the promoter George Jergen (Thayer David) decide on finding a local boy in Philadelphia to fight, zeroing in on Balboa for little reason more than his nickname, the Italian Stallion. He's reticent about the prospect. Rocky understands his limits and Creed's status as the best in the world, but it becomes too good of an opportunity to pass up. I think one of the keys to how this film works is the timing of certain events. The first is that Adrian and Rocky have their moment coming together, learning to open up to each other and fall in love, before Rocky gets his shot. This cements her as the one person he knows he can trust, as contrasted with Paulie who only seems to get helpful afterwards, hoping for a slice of the guaranteed $150,000 payout from the fight, or Mickey, who had told him off before the offer and comes begging to be his manager afterwards. After years of being rejected and used and insulted, Rocky has trouble trusting anyone, and he does eventually find ways to bring people in. And that's really the point of the film. It's not the literal fight with Creed, it's Rocky discovering his connections to other people who do genuinely love him, namely Adrian. It's about him discovering for himself that he's not a bum and that he could go the distance against Creed, last all fifteen rounds. It's not about winning. It's about proving that he belongs in that field, that he hasn't wasted the last six years of his life fighting to get nowhere. It's weird how a film where the hero doesn't actually win a fight can end up so affirming. I will say for a moment, that I found the direction rather pedestrian at best. I wouldn't really comment on it much normally, except that Avildsen won Best Director at the Oscars. I have no problem with Rocky winning Best Picture, I'd probably have voted for it, but I cannot imagine Avildsen deserving that Best Director award, especially up against Syndey Lumet for Network. I often at least partially attribute good performances to directors who can help mold the work of actors, so I cannot dismiss him completely here. The actors are all very good, and that's part of the package, but this really does feel like, overall, Avildsen getting a raw and very good script fall into his lap and largely just not screwing it up. I'm fine with that as a result, but it just kind of irritates me that Avildsen beat Lumet. I don't think that Avildsen's direction is a drag on the film, though. It's nothing special, but the strength is the script and performances, and they really get a lot of help from Conti's score. I have a major soft spot for Conti's music (like on Huston's Escape to Victory), and it's largely absent from the first hour, only getting an early show during the opening credits before slowly filtering in towards the buildup to the fight. Of course, the fight itself isn't the point, it's Rocky proving himself, and that's the ultimately victory. That it becomes so satisfying is really wonderful. Just, please, don't make any sequels, Sly. Rocky doesn't need it."
Rocky (1976),Motivational Classic,"Rocky remains a motivating cinematic masterpiece that continues to inspire audiences. However, there are moments where the film's pacing feels a bit sluggish. The training sequence is an absolute standout, a testament to the film's ability to invigorate and drive the story forward. Additionally, the score is nothing short of extraordinary, perfectly complementing the emotional depth of the narrative. What truly sets Rocky apart is its portrayal of the titular character as an underdog and, dare we say, something of an idiot. His ultimate victory, not in the ring, but in life, underscores the film's poignant message. Rocky's resilience and determination serve as a powerful reminder that it's not about how hard you can hit but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. This distinction sets Rocky apart from Apollo, who is only seeking to boost his image through the fight. Rocky's enduring spirit and will to keep moving forward is what makes this film an enduring classic."
Rocky (1976),The Enduring Magic of 'Rocky' Despite Boxing's Decline,"Rocky's rocky road to glory, both on and off the screen, makes for an impressive modern-day fairy tale. The tale of Sylvester Stallone winning an Academy Award for Best Picture with his first-ever screenplay is legendary. We all rooted for the underdog who overcame his troubled past to find his self-worth. But was the boxing ring the right stage for this pyrrhic victory? Stallone's script is simplicity itself, but credit must also go to director John Avildsen, who brought a cinema verité style to Rocky, making it feel like a gripping docudrama. In the early drafts, Rocky was a darker, less likable character, but Stallone wisely softened him. Despite moonlighting as a loan shark collector, Rocky refused to physically harm his deadbeat clients, revealing his heart of gold. Rocky's inner demons stem from doubts about his potential as a boxer. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, a former boxer turned trainer, berates Rocky for not working hard enough. Rocky's character and the audience are touched when Mickey gives his locker away, symbolizing his disappointment. Stallone's plotting shines when he cleverly shows how Rocky gets his shot at the heavyweight title. After the top contender is injured, champion Apollo Creed, excellently played by Carl Weathers, decides to give an underdog a chance for a publicity stunt. Rocky, initially reluctant, must face his doubts and fears. The evolving relationship between Rocky and Mickey adds depth to the story. Mickey, now willing to manage Rocky, is rejected at first, but their heartwarming reconciliation is a defining moment, cleverly shot at a distance to emphasize their embrace. While Rocky's boxing journey is thrilling, the film is more a love story. Talia Shire's understated performance as Adrian, a pet store employee initially portrayed as a spinster, adds a sensitive touch. The growing romance is tenderly handled, and Shire's best scene is the powerful confrontation with her brother Paulie, played by the late Burt Young, who also happens to be Rocky's best friend. Paulie represents the darker side of Rocky's insecurities, unable to control his anger at his own lot in life. His overbearing presence and strange emotional attachments to his sister hint at a more complicated relationship with possible incestuous feelings toward her. In its time, the climactic showdown was an adrenaline rush. Watching Creed and Rocky face off in the heavyweight championship was a visceral experience. Rocky's loss but indomitable spirit ""going the distance"" proved iconic. Today, the film may seem dated. Boxing has lost some of its luster, with no larger-than-life figures gracing the sport as in years past. More critically, the idea of redemption and triumph through the brutality of boxing has lost some of its shine, especially when we look at the post-career health of many fighters. Muhammad Ali's tragic battle with neurological damage serves as a sobering example. Despite these shifts, all the performances in Rocky hold up remarkably well, especially Stallone's, who never quite equaled this feat in his long career. As a modern-day fairy tale, Rocky remains an impressive cinematic achievement, even if the boxing metaphor feels a bit punch-drunk nowadays."
Rocky (1976),A Technical Knockout,"One of Sylvester Stallone's best films put him on the map, and launched a very successful franchise. Stallone wrote and stars as Rocky Balboa, a down-and-out fighter getting beat up in smoky clubs for chump change. He has a love/hate relationship with his friend Paulie (Burt Young), loves Paulie's sister Adrian (Talia Shire), and enforces payments to loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is looking for a title fight to celebrate the nation's bicentennial, but his opponent drops out. He and promoter Jergens (Thayer David) cook up a plan- give any mook a shot at the champ, in the name of the American way. Balboa is chosen, and Creed goes about the financial business of being a champ, not taking Rocky seriously. Rocky enlists the help of Mickey (Burgess Meredith), a gym owner who saw Rocky's potential many years before, but the two never acted on it. As the fight draws near, Rocky's relationship with Paulie deteriorates as his love for Adrian takes center stage. I had not seen the original ""Rocky"" in decades. I highly recommend the crisp widescreen DVD transfer, which puts all the videotape releases to shame. I literally forgot what a dark and grim film this is. Rocky's Philadelphia neighborhood is a bit run down, his apartment is a pit, and director John G. Avildsen captures it all perfectly, which is strange considering the almost comic book style of the sequels. Stallone does a fine scripting job. While Rocky's relationship with Adrian takes a while, and the volatile Paulie is never explored too much, Stallone seems to know what the film audience wants. I always thought the fight at the end of the film was longer, but it barely makes ten or fifteen minutes. Weathers' Apollo is not as big a jerk as I remember, until he gets into the ring and must put on his show. Adrian could not be mousier, even with Mickey ears and a tail, but her transformation is believable without being jarring. Young and Meredith also turn in fine performances, not yet the one dimensional characters the sequels would turn them in to. ""Rocky"" is not a excellent film. It is certainly a strong film, full of solid acting, writing, and directing. While I cannot fault any one ingredient for keeping it from being perfect, I do highly recommend it."
Rocky (1976),Solid,"I had been putting off watching this since the subject matter isn't really something that I am interested in, but I ultimately found Rocky to be an inspiring tale of determination and resilience. The movie is filled with inspirational scenes and quotes that have become a part of the culture. Rocky's ""Eye of the Tiger"" training montage is truly iconic, so much so that it has been parodied countless times throughout the year in pop culture. The movie also features memorable performances from Talia Shire and Burgess Meredith. Stallone does a solid job too, I can see why this has become a long running franchise that still continues today."
Rocky (1976),Timeless classic for all tastes,"I had no high expectations before watching Rocky, actually we could say that I had some preconceptions about it, being a gen z girl, but man, was I wrong! This movie kept my attention high from start to finish, and got me to keep thriving for the protagonist, impersonated by an amazing Silvester Stallone. Rocky, as I found, is not the stereotypical macho figure you might think: even though he is a boxer with the classic ''tough guy"" look, he often shows his most sensitive and fragile sides, which makes him a role model in many ways. I really liked the way they developed his love story with Adriana, because this side storyline was made almost as important as the main one, creating some balance and avoiding making it an action movie. Even though the movie came out in 1976 it is still perfectly enjoyable and the values it conveys are still relevant to our society nowadays, which to me makes it a timeless classic."
The Karate Kid (1984),Classic,"Forget its 2010 reboot/remake, this is probably one of the best 1980s films of all time. About years ago I watched some bits of it on TV3 (now Virgin Media One) and I thought I never saw any 1980s films like that before in my entire life. In late 2014, I watched the whole film on DVD. It's brilliant and the acting is very good especially from Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, William Zobka snd Elizabeth Shue themselves. It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic. I'd say it's definitely way better than its 2010 reboot/remake which is kinda boring and it's not great as its original 1984 version. If you are a fan of karate films, you'll like this."
The Karate Kid (1984),Feel good 1980s movie.,"A Superb film. The Karate Kid comes onto 4K blu ray with a lovely authentic transfer. The film retains all the grain and grit of a film shot in the 80s. Colours look lovely and natural, scenes shot at night get quite grainy but those filmed in the bright sunshine of California pack lots of colour and detail. The acting is superb, the casting also is great, the teenagers all actually look like teenagers in this film. Everything just feels nice and natural, the editing is good, the clothes and music are so 1980s. The lighting and fog on the beach when the boys on their motorbikes make their entrance, with the music playing alone is so iconic. There is some clever subtext in this film about family and also social class. There's also a strong underdog element to the film and the fight choreography is fantastic. The dialogue feels natural and casual, never rehearsed or forced."
The Karate Kid (1984),A fine classic,"It's a solid movie, Miyagi is a great character, he's got fantastic dialogue. Daniel isn't perfect. He's a bit prickly and ungrateful to Ali, it's a part of his defense mechanism, but it does make for some uncomfortable scenes. The movie doesn't impart any profound life lessons on viewers, but there's enough to be heartwarming and enjoyable. Action in this movie is OK. It's just barely passable, but this was made in the 80s, so I'll take what I can get. Soundtrack is pretty solid, some good tunes matched up to the scenes. Ending and resolution are abrupt, probably the weakest part of the movie but at least it makes for a happy ending."
The Karate Kid (1984),The Karate Kid,This is a 80s Classic Film. Ralph and William were fantastic in this film. The way Ralph was trained in the film was pretty cool. The the other two came out pretty good as well. What really blew me away was 30 years later they decided to put out a tv show. At first I was like don't mess up the film's. But they did not i love how they put in clips of all three films threw the tv show. The young kids in that show were also great young actors. I also liked how Ralphs daughter was a fighter and his son did not want to fight at all. I also liked how the truth came out in the bully back in the 80s. Then decided to help out Ralph the one he hated back in High School. The new show and the Old films fit perfect together in so many ways. Even with the Old time Bullies that were in the Army Cadets and stuff. It is crazy how life just goes on and on. It reminds me so much of the truth if you really think about it. Just look at the three films and the new show and think back about your childhood. There is a lot of truth in that film and tv show if you think about it.
The Karate Kid (1984),THE RISING KID,In the karate kid it was great because it goes by a normal story a teenager is school getting billed months later with karate exercises and skills meet again with the bully now the movie I mostly liked it because there was a seaqrel and many of the same characters return to the Cobra Kai series I just love that because they learn about there past and actually become friends like chozen and Daniel also johnny the thing that I mostly hated was the part of how when they went to different country's they made the country's and they stereotyped it so Im kind of against that another thing that wish was there was that maybe Daniels uniform can fit his size better.
The Karate Kid (1984),More than just an iconic 80s movie,"The Karate Kid is not just an iconic 80s movie. It's a well-made film which tells a timeless story that has stayed in the hearts & minds of viewers since it was released. I'm surprised by how well it holds up. This movie even kept my youngest kids engaged almost the entire time. Ralph Macchio is absolutely relatable as the timid Daniel LaRusso and William Zabka plays a villain you love to hate. Most of the magic, though, comes from Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He portrays a mentor for the ages, full of wisdom & warmth. It's nice to see that The Karate Kid is still able to compete with modern movies."
The Karate Kid (1984),Final Boss,"I can´t remember if I was reviewing this one before, but I can correct this one with nostalgia blindness. Daniel Larusso moves to California where he gets bullied, and he teams up with Mr. Miyagi to get his revenge at a karate championship. I am no karate expert, but which kid and teen did not love Asian countries, martial arts and Halloween dances? The movie is not showing the right message, and the movie is meme and parody worthy. But, the songs and music are classics the right way. This is a movie for the families that want some old school martial arts fun, but not some serious stuff like the Color Purple."
The Karate Kid (1984),Full on entertainment,"This franchise was in my watchlist for a long time and today I finally decided to start watching the franchise movies. For me, the movie was full on entertainment. It was same 80s flicks with an addition of karate in it. The story was simple, lovely and effective, the screenplay was good, the direction was good but could have been more better and the performances were good. You connect with the both lead actors. One thing I wanted to talk about was the climax which felt rushed to me, it could have been 10-15 minutes more longer. Overall, it's a good movie and you should definitely give this movie a try."
The Karate Kid (1984),Kind of tame in today's standards considering what we can watch these days,"(1984) The Karate Kid
DRAMA ACTION Popular during it's time, self- indulgent teen flick with a too simplistic story line starring Ralph Macchio as Danial who's antagonized by another fellow martial arts student Johnny (William Zabka) after he falls for his girlfriend, Ali (Elisabeth Shue). Daniel then gets taken under an older Japanese elder, Miyagi ( Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita) whose actually a karate instructor. To say anything more is ridiculous because you can pretty much know how this story is going to turn out. After looking back at it, this film is very tame in today's standards because I seen more effective martial art movies than this, where the action is plentiful and the training is vigorously harder to do. The more I think about this film the more simplistic it reminded me something from a ''Sunday Afternoon Special'"
The Karate Kid (1984),A Splendid Film For All Viewers to Enjoy and Learn,"This is a sensational film. This is a film for all viewers to watch and enjoy. The cast selection was brilliant. The storyline was truly great and reveals to viewers multiple things. The cast really committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry and connection between was really strong. This film reveals to viewers that it is possible for anyone to do anything in life. It also reveals the full limits of strength and courage. I have had a lot of troubles in my life. I was bullied too much growing up. This film also reveals to viewers the reality of growing up. This is an absolutely tremendous film for everyone to watch, enjoy, and learn."
American Underdog (2021),This Story Exemplifies the American Dream,"To start this is not the best film I have seen or even in that category but the emotions it brought in me were do strong that I had to rate higher then I would have if I based it on just as a film alone, probably would have rated it an 8. This film is the perfect example of what the highly touted iconic words ""The American Dream"" stands for. You got a very highly skilled football player who had a very bright future, finds a beautiful & supportive significant partner, but then everything came crashing down early on & along the way hes lost in his downward spiral, barely hanging on & struggling. We get to see the hardships endured by Kurt, while he forges deeper bonds with so many around him. Whether minor characters or major characters you get to witness enter his life & its as if each of them were meant to be Gods hand in pushing Kurt on the right track, no matter if its just simple words of encouragement or new opportunities that come knocking. Who doesn't love an underdog story anyway?? We always hear the successes n glamour of big sports stars but its not everyday u get to see a film dedicated to showing what it was like for them in their path climbing upwards & it has the love stories, the friendship bonds, it is so inspiring honestly while watching this. To be clear Football isn't even my top 3 sports I like lol & though I do watch the Super bowls & sometimes the playoffs too, but after watching this film it totally makes me want to watch football lol. Though I obviously logically knew how the film plays out, but I felt shivers & chills course through my body, full of excitement & energy as you watch the underdog trying to claw its way back up with everything to lose on the line & making his last push towards success... it was heartwarming honestly. Oh ya Great acting by uh the Shazam guy & awesome acting by the woman that plays his wife. If you lookin for something to pick yourself up when you're in a slump, losing faith, on a losing streak... I totally recommend this film to boost yourself up because while some of the facts of this film dont line up exactly to how his career actually started but I think thats not important cuz the main point of the story is showing what perseverance can do for someone even when they are at their rock bottom with no hope in sight, sometimes a Hail Mary can light their life up in 1 moment."
American Underdog (2021),Avoid it ! Really,"Who pays to all these members giving it 9-10 !?!?!? It is 100th time of these kind of stories in a movie even though this one is based on true events. Movie is maybe 4*, bad plot, very bad actors, only camera is okish. Check what masterpieces from Denzel have 7+ and then come back to this junk, it is done so poor, cant believe 20k people gave it 7. Avoid it even if it is free, go watch some rerun of some good movie. There is barely any good movies out here these days but as a rule, if it is on Netflix then it is pure junk, Netflix movie has like 1 of 1000 that it can be called good movie, everything else is wasting time."
American Underdog (2021),"If you love sports stories and want an uplifting movie, this is it","We've always loved sports movies, often baseball, but American Football works just as well. Not huge stars, although well known (Shazam, The Piano) and of course the wonderful Denis Quaid, but great casting and they work well together. It's a love story too, so something for the romantics amongst us, but like the name of the film, it's a story of adversity and living your dream. It's a super little film and we are so glad we found it. Especially after some of the dire movies that have been showing recently, and the constant super heroes that we see (I'm not adverse to DC or Marvel), but sometimes, you just want something well acted, with a great story, likeable characters - a film you can invest in without browsing on your device. Enjoy!"
American Underdog (2021),Loved It!,"Such an inspiring movie for anyone that feels like the underdog in any dream they are aspiring to achieve! Believe in yourself and others will believe in you too! Never give up! Give God the Glory when he blesses you with your dreams! This movie brought me to tears of joy! I love football and enjoyed every moment of this movie! It is a must watch. I am not sure why it is not rated much higher. It deserves ten stars! With every dream comes challenges and sometimes we have to change paths to get there but we eventually get there with God's help! God is with you every step of the way! Thank you for this 🍿, I loved it."
American Underdog (2021),The classic hero's way!👍👍👍,"Just endure long introduction, this beginning will help you understand the present and empathize with it. Great sports drama! This is an inspiring picture! A dream can come true, you just need to believe and not give up. The hero will have difficulties and, most importantly, this is a story about a real person! When I remember this movie, I want to cry tears of joy, but don't believe me verbatim. :) The viewer together with the hero of this film will be confused, then he will struggle with life's difficulties, and then he will win! - A real classic hero's way! This is one of the best Zachary Levi movie roles!"
American Underdog (2021),American Underdog Common Sense Review,"I'm a sucker for sports movies, I truly enjoy them despite the common tropes and clichés that they fall into. American Underdog is different I would argue because the theme of faith makes up the foundation of the film, while not being overwhelming or preachy. Sporting an all-star cast that all give great performances, this film manages to avoid most of the cheesiness often associated with both sports and faith-based films. Sharing the inspiring story of Kurt Warner and his quest to make it to the NFL, this story of perseverance and heart will make for a great time with the family. What were your thoughts on the film?"
American Underdog (2021),VIEWS ON FILM review of American Underdog,"As a guy who watches an immense amount of NFL football, I couldn't help but be amazed at the story of Kurt Warner. Kurt went undrafted and when he couldn't get a pro team to sign him, he ended up stocking shelves at a grocery store in Iowa. Now Warner is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame after winning a Super Bowl, playing in two more, and becoming a two-time, National Football League MVP. 2021's American Underdog is a biographical flick about this real-life, victim/hero. You watch it and think, maybe said hero deserved a more epic tribute. American Underdog runs 112 minutes. Its story minus the romance factor (Warner and wife Brenda), is pretty straight-forward, like almost identical to Kurt's wiki page. ""Underdog"" is also directed by two people in brothers Andrew and Jon Erwin. Andrew and Jon opt for a glossy look, a miscast Dennis Quaid (as coach Dick Vermeil), and some Disney undertones (even though the film's distributor is Lionsgate). They go for the schmaltz too but their ""Underdog"" never feels compelling enough or old-world like say, Rudy (another flick about weaker sports parties). Then there's the football scenes of aw-shucks Kurt (played by Zachary Levi) flinging the pigskin around and getting hit like a brick at the same time. There's not enough of them and they feel pedestrian, like Levi just nonchalantly made some nifty plays. I mean where's the struggle in the pocket? And where's the grit? And where's the nasty, gridiron optics that Jack ""Cap"" Rooney went through? Nada, no where to be found. Bottom line: if you want to gather the family around, make some popcorn, and ogle at a few dewy-eyed moments between a QB legend, his in the cards plight, and his loyal lady, then American Underdog is the movie for you. If you want something more than a feel-good, TV-like vehicle transitioning on the come up, well you won't have a ""dog"" in this fight. Natch."
American Underdog (2021),Awesome Football Movie,"Based on a true story, American Underdog is a wonderful and uplifting story about QB Kurt Warner's struggles and challenges he had getting to the NFL. Growing up, Kurt Warner always dreamed of playing in the NFL. He watched Super Bowl XIX and he decides that he will play in the NFL and win a Super Bowl and MVP. So years later Kurt is the quarterback for the University of Northern Iowa. He plays 5 years and he has very good stats as the starting quarterback. He is so sure he will be picked in the NFL draft... But one team after another, every team passes him over. Kurt went through several NFL tryouts with various teams but to no avail. So Kurt goes to work for a local grocery store. But he never gave up, and gets a offer to play Arena Football. Kurt became a star QB of that league. He even made the Arena Football Hall of Fame. Soon Kurt's fame spread and reaches the NFL scouts. Finally the door is open to his dream. Dick Vermeil, coach of the Rams goes against his entire staff and signs Kurt Warner as the Rams backup quarterback. ""I just want my shot. I want one chance to prove that I'm good enough"" - Kurt
When the Rams starting QB is injured, Kurt steps in and becomes the starter. Oh and not just a starting QB, Kurt won a Super Bowl, Super Bowl MVP, and NFL MVP. As much as Kurt loves playing football and receiving all the awards. He placed his family first and gives them credit, having the people you love to stand by you through all the struggles. ""It doesn't mean anything if you don't have someone to share it with"" - Kurt
I really enjoined this underdog movie. A bit rare and unique for a football movie... And even if you are not a football fan, this is a really awesome feel-good underdog story. I do wish there more films like this."
American Underdog (2021),Nice movie but not complete,"As a European i can see this as a 'true' American story. Just a shame that the left out the part where he played in NFL Europe with the Amsterdam Admirals. I was at all the games but guess it was a phantom on the field and not Kurt Warner...
True story it is not, it is shortened and adapted for making an entertaining movie. So when you watch this keep that in mind. Fact is he did not come on the team the season they went to the superbowl. That was his 2nd season with the team and between 98-99 he played the season in NFL Europe. It is said his wife hated the godless city of Amsterdam so it could be 1 of the reasons they left that part out."
American Underdog (2021),Real Life Sports Success Story Meets the Silver Screen!!,"Based on the life of NFL Hall of Famer, MVP, Super Bowl MVP, and Super Bowl champion Kurt Warner is a jarring and almost unbelievable story of a young man from the Midwest and his dogged determination never to give up on his football dream!! Well played by Shazam's Zachary Levi, Warner wasn't even necessarily the star of his college football team, Northern Iowa, a school that really doesn't get much attention from the NFL our it's team's scouts. That didn't deter Warner though, and after winning over his wife Brenda played very well by X-Men's Anna Paquin, his journey through life and the many twists and turns to ultimate glory began including barely a cup of coffee with the Green Bay Packers, a stint with the Arena League's Iowa Barnstormers, even a job at a local HyVee grocery store to pay the bills that eventually led to Warner signing with the then St Louis Rams and ultimate glory as a Super Bowl champion in 1999!! This is the type of movie that makes you feel good, stays with you, and inspires you never to give up even when the odds look daunting!! It also reminds you of the importance of family & friendship & how important they are in making dreams come true!! Good acting, realistic football action with some possible performances by former NFL players Hall of Famer Ray Lewis & fellow Hall of Famer & former St Louis Ram Marshall Faulk mixed with actual game footage make this the second best football movie of all-time slightly behind 1990's Rudy and above Al Pacino's Any Given Sunday in my opinion!! 7 out of 10 stars!!"
Moneyball (2011),really good,"Come to me with these, come with a biography. When I looked at the cast of the movie and saw Brad Pitt, of course I watched it without hesitation. Actually, I had a prejudice. Because I have never played or watched the game of baseball in my life. I know the rules and the game, but I don't follow it at all, so I thought I might get bored, but it didn't bother me for a moment. These guys do the job of biography well. I'm already interested in biopics. The movie was very good. The best thing about biopics is that what happened is real, what is said is real, you can go and look at the photos. After every biography movie, I search for a long time on Google to see what the characters in the movie I watched are doing now. I did. Watch a really good sports movie."
Moneyball (2011),Numbers and tactics made beautiful,"After being defeated by the New York Yankees in the 2001 play-offs, losing three of his key players to bigger contracts at richer clubs, and then being refused more funds for new players by the club's owner, Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) hires an inexperienced Yale economics graduate (Jonah Hill) and starts utilizing hard statistics (now known as sabermetrics) to recruit specialized talent who are seemingly over the hill or has another defect which have made them unattractive to other clubs. Will this novel and - to many - controversial approach pay off? In form and structure, Moneyball is a familiar underdog story which have been known to work ever so well many times before on the big-screen. However, this is no Rocky with lots of action and simple, emotional dialogue. And it's no Youngblood style of film in which the game itself is simplified to attract ""regular"" viewers. On the contrary, Moneyball is something as rare as a sports film about numbers and tactics. It's not only based on real-life people and events, but it also treats and presents these people and events accordingly, and not through a conventionalized archetype-filter. A film as technical and theory-oriented as this one may sound inaccessible to outsiders, but as a typical European soccer-fan with minimal knowledge about the game of baseball, I say on the contrary. This is a breath of fresh air in a world of movie-making which often underestimates its viewers. Moneyball is a detailed and fairly fast-paced account from an environment about which the filmmakers are never afraid to be specific and comprehensive. And this works as a perfect counterweight to the heart and moral of the story, which is undeniably simplistic, but also inherently beautiful. Brad Pitt gives arguably the best performance of his career as real-life GM Billy Beane. His performance has a drive and a carefreeness which I haven't seen in Pitt for years, and combined with appropriate mannerisms and a clearly deep understanding of the character, he gives the film the momentum it needs. Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman complement him with fine supporting work in a film which puts Aaron Sorkin's edgy dialogue to the best use that it has been since A Few Good Men. And the fine directing job is credited to Bennett Miller (of Capote) and he conveys the script, which Sorkin co-wrote with Steve Zaillian, with a clear focus about what he wants to accomplish, handling the sentimental and the bittersweet with equal aptitude."
Moneyball (2011),A Hard-Hitting Sport Film,"""Moneyball"" is a sports film that revolves around the efforts of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane, portrayed by Brad Pitt. Beane attempts to build a competitive baseball team while working with a tight budget. He employs innovative methods to acquire new players. Now, after this brief introduction, ""Moneyball"" firmly falls into the 'Sports' genre, a genre well-known for its predictable narrative arc. In such stories, underdog teams must struggle relentlessly to achieve what nobody believes they can. This formula has a long history of success because everyone enjoys a compelling comeback story from time to time. The film shines primarily due to its exceptional ensemble cast, featuring outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and the legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. They are the driving force behind this film, making it worth a watch. ""Moneyball"" is a deliberately paced and grounded film. It maintains a clear sense of identity, avoiding the grandiose moments that some might expect. It stands as a well-acted film with an ideal pace and tone, emphasizing its strengths while leaving behind the repetitive elements often associated with the 'Sports' genre."
Moneyball (2011),Can be watched by anyone,"...who either likes baseball or who doesn't watch baseball. It is something that can entertain the most unknowledgeable viewer in terms of baseball. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill deliver excellent performances and their chemistry really shows throughout the whole film. Brad Pitt especially delivers a convincing performance as Billy Beane. The film approaches sports in an analytic point of view while still showing the baseball being played. The music score will give you goosebumps in some scene and it's a film that I come back to watch time after time. To balance out the drama, there are some comedic moments scattered around in the film. This is one to watch for sure."
Moneyball (2011),Brad Pitt can literally fit any given role !,"Moneyball. Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to assemble a baseball team on a lean budget by employing computer-generated analysis to acquire new players. I'm really astonished how a movie about baseball is that interesting and fun to watch, considering that I know nothing about it nor the numbers they were discussing most of the time. So, this movie can be people like me as much as baseball fans and that couldn't be possible without the well-written dialogs by Aaron Sorkin and especially Brad Pitt's performance, he literally can fit any given role. This movie present also a very important subject, which is youth and science vs experience and rituals . The exploitation of statistics in different fields can be a game changer as a revolutionary step that a lot of sport club are taking and it had so many great outcomes through the years. I forgot to mention that Jonah Hill was great too."
Moneyball (2011),Better than the Book!,"This is the only movie I have ever seen where the movie actually was better than the book (And the book was great - Thank you Michael Lewis!) While there are some subtleties that the non-baseball fan will miss, the basic theme of changing old philosophies reasonates. Does not matter if is technology, the arts, or even a game as old as baseball, change is inevitable but even harder to implement. A rare gem thst transcends the sports and allows all viewers to appreciate the resiliency to ""stick your guns"" when everybody says u r crazy. I cannot recommend this movie enough to all the non- baseball fans out there. This movie is first and foremost a triumph for anybody who thinks outside the box and does not conform to the masses. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are amazing. Phillip Seymour's genius- his non verbal actions- are all the more reason to ache for his talent which was taken far too early from all of us. 4 out of 4 Stars."

Overall, my favorite pure sports movie as this incredible underdog story uses writing, acting, and score to help make the audience feel invested in the team's journey, though its tone and historical inaccuracies hold it back from being incredible. Very Good to Great Direction (Nothing extraordinary about the directing style but does a very good job at moving the story forward and getting the most out of the actors (Plays a lot into dramatic tropes in directing)), Very Good Acting (Great from Brad Pitt (A very calculated performance as he used his experience as a leading man to drive the movie forward), Very Good from Jonah Hill (A very soft-spoken role that is a departure from his previous work, but he does a very good job in playing off of Pitt throughout the movie (especially capturing the anxious/nerdy parts of the character); the main issue with the performance is that it is very limiting (so Jonah Hill really cannot show that much off)), Good to Very Good from Philip Seymour Hoffman (Uses experience to play this role as his character seems more like a cameo than a central figure (but he does a very good job in holding his own and building tension with Pitt)), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role very well as they all come together to be this island of misfit toys that can be pushed to greatness)), Great Story (Story is laid out incredibly as it chooses the right elements to focus on; the main issue with the story is its factual inaccuracies as it deviates from the truth for no reason (as simple searches will show where they are making things up); Great character writing as it does a great job exploring the demons of every character and how almost everyone has something to prove), Great to Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue flows incredibly well and is very iconic (but there are some lines that are a bit questionable), the symbolism is incredibly profound as it helps with driving the message forward; foreshadowing was good as a biopic could be), Great Score (An iconic theme that is used very well throughout the movie), Great Cinematography (The best moment is during the streak but overall captures the movie very well), Very Good Sound (The pop off the ball helps with portraying some symbols and elements of the movie), Great Editing (Really enjoyed how they used the grainy TV screen for flashbacks and how they interpolated old footage into the film), Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was incredible as it does a great job at setting up the different plot elements and uses the individual story elements very well to help with driving the movie forward, Pacing was a bit on the slower side (but this is more from the tone); runtime is fine as every scene is used well, Climax was great as the movie ends how it is supposed to end as this helps with showing its meaning, Tone was a bit on the blander side as there is just a bit of some dead-air (though overall it can combat this with great writing and great scenes) ORIGINAL (06/13/2017)

Great Acting, Great Story, Great Screenplay but some lines are questionable, Great Score, Very Relatable Movie, Great Job exploring the demons of every character and how almost everyone has something to prove, Ending was kinda out of place."
Moneyball (2011),New Age Heroism,"This sports drama represents the peak of the American indie cinema movement of the early 21st century led by Newline Cinema but not without affecting the rhythm and tone of the film. It portrays a sociopath baseball coach (Pitt) with bigger dreams than his university skills can allow. And so he spends most of his time lobbying for a sponsorship for a pathetic team of boys and for some salvation along the way in a moneyballed league. The film then circles around to focus not on the rules of the game but more on the human side to life. It grows out of its immature shell exactly as the director wants and to the approval of the audience into serious and compelling cinema. The film balances itself solely on the experienced shoulders of Brad Pitt. A word must be said about how impactful the acting is as he emotes his way through the crisis that he does not deserve. Moneyball is a tearful script but still a badly made film. It has ordinary lines and the scenes drag themselves with no special effort from the director and his team and it seems as if Pitt should be encouraging them instead of the players. Sadly in this case, it is just not uplifting enough. A poignant thought arises about the two important dimensions of any game, the unbroken will of an individual and the sacrifices that are made by members of a team. Moneyball hints at these qualities as it seeks to elucidate the tenets of human adventurism. The theme of the film unaltered, it falls into the list of the stoic Clint Eastwood hero but very much for the new age in this case."
Moneyball (2011),"Enjoyable, even as a non-baseball enthusiast","As we all know, the best films that revolve around a particular sport are the ones that can be shown to anyone and they'd still enjoy themselves. This is what Moneyball got right thanks to great performances all around from Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman and an excellent child's turn from Kerris Dorsey. Some serious credit must also be given to Wally Pfister who shot the film with such detail, cleverness and expressiveness that almost each and every shot conveys the story of each scene perfectly. Moneyball is a sports drama that others within the genre should take notes from and has a screenplay that ranks among some of the best that I have come across."
Moneyball (2011),"Even with a frustrating ending, ""Moneyball"" is an honest account of an obsession and an obsessed. A somewhat romantic film about the least romantic of situations","The staging of ""Moneyball"" uses the traditional paths of a biopic - in the way of presenting the story, filming and editing -, the film ends up reproducing in its own form that characteristically artificial coldness. By choosing not to delve into any of the emotional dimensions of the narrative, whether in Beane's family relationships or in the trauma of the former player and now manager, the work is established in such a way as to create a resonance of the coldness imposed by numbers: everything is very aseptic, devoid of the feeling that it even seeks to emulate at certain times and ""synthetic"" in the sense that the camera itself proposes the staging in order to emphasize only the essential and already established elements. We do not, therefore, have a living construction of the scene to the point of reflecting the emotional impulse that germinates in the story, leaving the work with a montage without its own particularity, given over to the numbers. Even if it is not clear, it is a safe bet to say that Sorkin is responsible for the strongest link in the script, and that seems to have been inserted after his entry into the project: Billy's relationship with his daughter (the great Kerris Dorsey), something that the screenwriter has been working hard on his latest projects. It's no different here, as even though Billy and his daughter have little more than five scenes together, the biggest decision the GM makes in the narrative comes motivated by his daughter; a clear romanticization of real life, but which gains a lot of strength thanks to Sorkin's exquisite execution, with emphasis on the use of the song ""The Show"" which comes with a very relevant modification to the story. Still on Billy Bean's journey, the flashbacks that show his promising, but eventually failed career as a professional baseball player are important for us to understand his fear and conflict when faced with a choice that involves money. It is the nucleus that ends up distracting us from the central plot, but which has the importance justified by the character's arc. And not that this is something, at first, problematic. With the intention of transmitting a debate (very fruitful, by the way) about the paradoxical duality between tradition and modernity, the film could very well opt for coldness to resonate certain critical ideals. The problem is that ""Moneyball"" never proposes something of this type, because it chooses precisely to establish itself in the expected paradigms. Thus, it repeats the formula through an inconsistency: its theme appears as if it sought to excavate in the midst of that ""anti-nature"" a human warmth that only numbers would not be able to provide, however its form is limited to being formulated by repeating these very patterns. Numerical. But that doesn't mean it's bad. In direction, we have an even more peculiar choice than the theme. Bennett Miller - nominated for an Oscar for ""Capote"" - lends his unmistakably slow and silent style to the film, something that doesn't come to mind when we imagine a script as verbose and fast as most of the prose involving Sorkin. However, when we analyze what a more dynamic filmmaker like Danny Boyle does with such material, we realize how Miller's approach proves to be right, offering a pace never seen before for a text by the screenwriter. He values the richness of the dialogues and gives the viewer time to really let the words sink into our minds. These pauses also ensure a very subtle and understated comedic edge, as when Brandt breaks bad news to Billy, and he waits about 5 seconds before throwing his desk in the air in the quietest, most polite tantrum on the planet. This decision by Miller guarantees a very intelligent mise en scene, which constantly bets more on images to convey something. The opening scene is a prime example of this purely visual narrative, already capturing the viewer's curiosity with the image of Billy sitting alone among the seats of a deserted and gloomy stadium (beautifully photographed by Wally Pfister, in a rare collaboration that is not for Christopher Nolan), already symbolizing that our hero is on an apparently lonely journey: he is the only one who still believes in the team, and who has a different view of his scout bench, made up mainly of elderly people. The framing game continues to show us that Billy is listening to the A's play live. He is not at the stadium, nor has he even subjected himself to watching on television, just listening. Then Billy gets in his car and starts driving, angrily; he wants to escape that situation, and it is very symbolic that Miller starts and ends the feature with the character inside a car. Finally, Billy takes out his frustration on his pocket radio, banging it against the dashboard and throwing it out the window. But, the emotion gone, he slowly gets out of the car and walks to get it back. As much as Billy hates his situation, he's not going to just walk out on it. Not only in the narrative, Miller's style obviously affects the entire performance of the cast, and in a more than positive way. As the director opts for a virtually non-existent soundtrack (generally accompanying establishment shots or transitions), the entire cast lacks the power of inspiring music or the comic and dramatic beats that usually reinforce their performances. Here, Miller even captures the sound of people coughing in the background, leaving them completely bereft of outside elements. This guarantees killer performances from the main cast, with Brad Pitt delivering one of his most complex work yet, capturing Billy's charisma and always letting his fear show through the small layers behind his sense of humor: when he says to Brandt in tones of threat that ""this better work"", the 2 seconds of silence that precedes his laugh and the line ""I'm just kidding"", reveal that the GM really is paralyzed with fear, in just one example of the many subtleties of a performance that wins wealth through its various reactions. The same applies to Jonah Hill, who at the time delivered his first fully dramatic performance, surprising everyone by coming out of comedies like ""Superbad"", and barely raising his voice to live the shy Peter Brandt. As expected in this type of archetype, the most interesting thing about Hill's work is seeing how the analyst loses his more reserved aspect and shows his more extroverted side, and also overcomes fear to get around embarrassing situations, such as dismissing players. His big moment also comes from a moment of reaction and silence, with Miller portraying Brandt and Billy talking on the phone to get some players traded. We never hear the voice on the other line, leaving only the actors' faces as a clue to the dialogue, and Hill's ""quietly hysterical"" reaction to clenching his fists is simply marvelous. Pitt and Hill together is a combination that worked very well. The two dominate the film, but it is worth mentioning the rich supporting cast, which also features the late Philip Seymour Hoffman delivering a performance that expresses the team coach's disappointment with the new tactics employed by Billy, rarely changing his grumpy expression. Today hyped by Guardians of the Galaxy, Chris Pratt has good moments as the player Scott Hattenberg, being efficient in transmitting the humility of the player who, forgotten for the simple fact of ""shooting weirdly"", is remembered by Billy and taken from the darkness of unemployment. Robin Wright and director Spike Jonze have a good scene to convey the strangeness of a father's encounter with his ex-wife and her current boyfriend, but little Kerris Dorsey steals the show as the protagonist's daughter, as mentioned earlier. The problem with ""Moneyball"" is the development of its plot which is very drawn out, which is frustrating at times. The great expectation is towards the end of the film, when most of the objectives are achieved, and they win most of the games (20 in a row). But unfortunately, the moment of overcoming does not arrive and leaves the spectator with the feeling of ""dying on the beach"". The GM suffers a lot of pressure, he almost loses his job, he bets everything he has on a team of ""underdog"" players, but the team DOESN'T WIN the championship. In the end, Brad Pitt's character receives an astronomical offer to be the General Manager of the Boston Red Sox (a renowned team) but does not accept it, to try AGAIN to win with the failed team. What happens? He never wins, and the Red Sox manage to win two years later, using the same odds and stats strategy (only with more money). The main character changes the way businessmen see and invest in baseball, but he doesn't gain anything from it. He doesn't even take the victory home, and the film ends with his daughter singing on a CD, saying that he ""doesn't know where he's going and he's a loser"". Impressive!! Even with the points raised above, ""Moneyball"" is an honest account of an obsession and an obsessed. A somewhat romantic film about the least romantic of situations: the moment when a sport (or several of them) stopped being 100% played on the fields to be pre-defined in graphs and tables. ""But how not to be romantic about baseball"" when the human factor is in everyone and insists on ignoring certainties?"
Rush (I) (2013),The real story of famous racers,"The 2013 ""Rush"" from director Ron Howard is a high-quality and soulful film that demonstrates the exciting story, adrenaline of Formula 1 racing and human drama. This picture was even nominated in the Best Film category at the Golden Globe Awards, but lost to the film 12 Years a Slave. A serious opponent who could not be bypassed. Nevertheless, Howard's project became a memorable work in the careers of all involved. In the ""Rush"", the excellent acting and successful directorial vision create a rich and exciting world. Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda go beyond the simple embodiment of the characters, and their characters come to life. Charismatic characters allow the viewer to feel the inner fire of rivalry and passion for victory. Hemsworth, known for his appearance and charm, convincingly conveys the passion and audacity of his character, creating an image of an intriguing and often uncomfortable hero for others. Involuntarily, a comparison with the famous hero Thor, whom Hemsworth has been playing for many years, suggests itself. Here, under the appearance of Thor, there is a completely different character, into which the actor has so successfully reincarnated. Chris's excellent performance, a worthy role that will forever remain in his career as one of the strongest. Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda perfectly conveys the character of this legendary racer. His acting work is characterized by precision and depth, revealing not only Lauda's professional qualities, but also his inner world, including difficult moments in his personal life. The script of the film is masterfully written, paying attention not only to racing and high speed, but also to the deep human relationships underlying the story. This balance between competition and friendship creates a touching and exciting aspect that manages to be conveyed in every frame. Technically, the painting was created with great care. Decent editing and soundtrack give the film a special status, taking it to a new level, especially in the racing scenes, where the viewer almost physically feels the speed and adrenaline. Especially impressive is the attention to detail in the visual design of the film, recreating the style of the 1970s. Costumes, cars, scenery - everything embodies the atmosphere of that era and gives the film a unique character. And the color correction is deliberately specially selected in such a way that the viewer feels like he is watching a 1970s movie. But, of course, one of the main achievements of the ""Rush"" is the exciting racing scenes. They not only immerse the viewer into the world known even to people who are not interested in Formula 1, but also convey the extreme sensations and risks associated with this sport. Ron Howard's compositional work is an art that can pull the viewer into the dynamic world of race tracks and at the same time remain true to the deep human aspects of the story. The director's vision of the director deserves the highest praise. He expertly handles Peter Morgan's script, immersing the viewer in the intriguing world of Formula 1 and at the same time paying attention to human relationships. Howard emphasizes emotional moments and moves from exciting racing scenes to deep reflections of the characters with ease, as if playfully, not allowing the viewer to understand where the transition from action to drama and back happens. The director not only gives the viewer the opportunity to feel the adrenaline of racing, but also delves into the psychology and motivation of the characters. He carefully balanced the dynamic racing moments with the touching and meaningful scenes between Hunt and Lauda, creating a harmonious piece. The painting is remembered for another important aspect - the work of Hans Zimmer. It has long been no secret to me that the projects to which the composer puts his hand are literally doomed to success. I love Zimmer's music, and it's very good here. The musical work in the film adds an additional layer of emotional saturation and enhances the visual range. Hans Zimmer, known for his unique style and sense of rhythm, created a soundtrack that perfectly matches the dynamics of the racing scenes and at the same time skillfully emphasizes the internal conflicts of the characters. His compositions in the film seem to become a separate character who actively interacts with the plot and conveys subtle interweaving of emotions. The picture is not limited only to visual and acting aspects, but also includes the musical magic of Hans Zimmer. ""Rush"" is not just an ordinary film about professionals driving, of which there are probably a dozen. This is a great real story about friendship, passion, overcoming oneself and difficulties. Director Ron Howard has created a work that can delight and inspire, even those who are not fans of the world of racing. The painting is still remembered with interest, even a decade after viewing. This is an exciting journey that leaves an indelible impression and causes deep admiration for the work of the entire team, and, most importantly, opens up the real stories of Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the average viewer. 9 out of 10."
Rush (I) (2013),Pretty fun ride!,"In the mid-1970s, charismatic English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) share an intense rivalry in Formula 1 racing. Driving vehicles that are little more than gas-filled, rolling bombs, Hunt and Lauda burn up the track, all the while pushing themselves to the breaking point of physical and mental endurance. Meanwhile, the women (Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) in their lives can only watch as both drivers risk death with every lap. Ever since I developed an obsession with Formula 1, all the old F1 fans have been telling me to watch this movie. To start off, you don't have to be a Formula 1 fan to watch or like this movie at all. However, if you are one and still haven't checked Rush out, you definitely should. As a sports movie, Rush is an incredibly crafted movie by Ron Howard and Peter Morgan that is very entertaining and focuses on the massive difference between the 2 main characters and how they develop throughout the movie. The cast, and especially Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl as they genuinely emotionally attach the audience to each of their respective characters in a very good way. Also due to their acting and to the brilliant screenplay, you can't really side with one character over the other as both their flows and good parts appear in this film. I just have a slight problem with the movie's pace at just minor instants but overall its a very fun ride."
Rush (I) (2013),formula,"It has been on my list since it was released, and I always postponed watching it even though I knew I would like it; It was a story that I liked when I watched it. You don't need to be familiar with Formula culture to love the movie. There is a natural and simple expression. Both actors did justice to their roles and showed quality. The ambition and passion of two different characters for the same goal is conveyed very successfully. The most striking line of the movie is; ""Happiness is the biggest enemy. It weakens a person. It puts doubts in your mind. Suddenly you have something to lose. When I say happiness is the biggest enemy, it is too late, you have already lost."""
Rush (I) (2013),A brilliant work!,"I saw Tony Scott's ""Days of Thunder"" last night and disliked it for a variety of reasons, one of which being the lack of intensity and elaboration on the 'Rivalry' aspect. ""Rush"" not only provides great suspense during the main races, but it also wonderfully captures the off-track enmity as well as latent respect between Lauda and Hunt, which ultimately pushes them to their absolute limits! I don't follow Formula One religiously, nor do I claim to be an expert on the sport, but I do have tremendous regard for the drivers of Formula One who compete in it and defy death on a daily basis. ""Rush"" provided some flashes of the same, and it was delightful to look at."
Rush (I) (2013),"A Dynamic Blend of Speed, Rivalry, and Cinematic Excellence","**Title: Rush (2013) - A Dynamic Blend of Speed, Rivalry, and Cinematic Excellence** *In Ron Howard's 2013 film ""Rush,"" the marriage of a compelling plot, stellar acting, and breathtaking cinematography creates an adrenaline-fueled masterpiece.* **Plot:**
The film chronicles the intense Formula 1 rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, transcending the racetrack to explore the complexities of competition, friendship, and resilience. The plot's brilliance lies in its ability to balance the thrill of high-speed racing with the intimate portrayal of the characters' personal struggles. The pacing is expertly crafted, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. **Acting:**
Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the charismatic and reckless James Hunt is nothing short of captivating. He seamlessly captures Hunt's charm and vulnerability, making the audience both root for and question the character. Daniel Brühl, on the other hand, delivers a powerhouse performance as the methodical and determined Niki Lauda. The chemistry between the two actors elevates the film, adding depth to the fierce competition at the core of the narrative. **Cinematography:**
Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is a visual feast that propels the audience into the heart of the racing world. The dynamic camera work captures the speed and danger of Formula 1, creating a visceral experience for viewers. The film's visuals are not confined to the racetrack; they extend to the character-driven moments, allowing the audience to feel the emotional highs and lows alongside the protagonists. In conclusion, ""Rush"" stands as a triumphant example of how a well-crafted plot, exceptional acting, and stunning cinematography can synergize to create a cinematic tour de force. Ron Howard's direction ensures that every twist and turn in both the characters' lives and the racecourse is a pulse-pounding journey for the audience. The result is a film that not only pays homage to the adrenaline rush of Formula 1 but also explores the human spirit in the face of rivalry and adversity."
Rush (I) (2013),The best F1 film,"A dive into the past for those who lived it, an epic and legendary duel sweetened just enough to make the story more exciting. The protagonists perfectly embody the two historical F1 characters Lauda and Hunt. For us European racing lovers it was like reliving that season, so dramatic but at the same time so exhilarating. I didn't feel like giving it a 10 just because, like all films that border on documentaries, they don't have that inventive component that gives it that extra point. But Howard really did a great job! I recommend it to all those who lived through that period as enthusiasts and will not be disappointed. They will love it!"
Rush (I) (2013),The great story of a great rivalry,"I was told that this was a great movie and I can now confirm that it is. Despite not being familiar at all with the story and the context of Formula One in the 1970s, the movie does an amazing job at reviving the challenges faced by the racers and the industry during this period. It is subtly but surely implied from the first encounter between Lauda and Hunt that their long-lasting rivalry was in fact one of the main drivers of their respective success. Brühl's performance is totally on point in depicting the intriguing character of Lauda. I'll remember Lauda's quote in one of the final scenes, where we understand the complexity of their relation : ""Stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life. It can be a blessing, too. A wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends."""
Rush (I) (2013),F1 Biopic from the prime era,"I'm a fan of biopic and historical movies as well as sports movies, though I do find F1 (in its modern incarnation) pretty boring. With this in mind I was very curious how I would find this film as a lot or reviewers were saying how amazing it is (F1 fan or otherwise). Overall I wasn't disappointed and think it's very well done. The design and photography really convey well the period and the actors all resemble the people they portray. The racing is very well shot and keeps you interested in the intense rivalry on the track as well as the personal differences off of it. I would say it tries to put the characters too much into their box to keep the narrative of the film (Lauda being hyper geeky, unlikable, boring, intense etc, and Hunt the polar opposite). But otherwise a well shot movie with a good pace that didn't drag. It's a rare type of film for this age so I'm happy to be educated as well as entertained by this overlooked sporting rivalry from the 1970's. 8/10."
Rush (I) (2013),The great movie in 2013,"Rush This movie, for me, is very great and one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I am not really exaggerating, and I can't find anyone talking about the movie at all. I don't know how. If it was on the level of directing from the oppressed director Roaword, the thing that caught my attention the most was his choice of actors, because after the movie I couldn't imagine anyone in their place playing these characters, and Chris Hemsworth was a really good choice and very appropriate. I couldn't imagine anyone in his place, and this is his best performance in his career, in my opinion, and the same. We are also talking about actor Daniel Brühl and his wonderful performance as Niki Lauda The soundtrack by the great Hans Zimmer was amazing, I can't forget it, and one of Hans Zimmer's greatest works This is not the impressive cinematography In my opinion, this movie is the greatest sports and racing movie Also, and better than the Ford v Ferrari, although I liked the Ford v ferrari very much, but in my opinion, Rush is better."
Rush (I) (2013),I am not a race fan - but I love this movie,First off you don't have to be a race fan to enjoy this - everything you need to know is very neatly encapsulated into this movie. This has lots of action and the car races are thrilling but this is mostly about the two characters at the heart of this. This is set in the 70s and a great deal of effort has been put into setting the period. Seeing spectators precariously perched on billboards or almost wiped out by debris really absorbs you into the time. The casting and acting is amazing - watching Chris and Daniel Brühl spa on and off the track is very engaging. Special mention to Alexandra Maria Lara who effortlessly injects a huge dose of emotion into what could have become an empty thrill ride. I have this on Blu-ray and I would recommend watching the extras - they are short sharp documentaries on the story and making-of. It was fascinating to see how this masterpiece was put together.
Champions (2023),Very entertainng light hearted movie!,"There are a few slightly adult short scenes, no nudity but probably not for kids under 12 years old. It's written well and is a charming movie The mentally challenged actors in the film speak well enough to easily understand. You might seem to get annoyed at them at the beginning but later you end up getting drawn to their characters and really cheering for them. Woody Harrelson carries the film with ease with his excellent natural acting. What's not to like about him? This movie is a feel good movie without being too corny and insulting to the audience. It's just a lot of fun and has a couple laugh out loud moments. This is a good movie to watch with your spouse and teenagers."
Champions (2023),Typical Woody,"The plot of the movie was enough of a turn-off as it seems degrading to use intellectually disabled people to make Woody Harrelson or anyone else look funny or entertaining. But I gave it a chance. The supporting actors were fantastic, even through working with a horrible screenplay. But Woody Harrelson comes out blazing as the same character he always plays in every movie and continues to play himself throughout the movie. The writing isn't great. So much is left out or forgotten. The sudden back and forth changes in his behavior and treatment of the members his basketball team are so ridiculous and unbelievable. One minute he's cutting them down, the next he's supposed to be believable in his (terribly bad acting) deep concern for them and their well-being when the players leave for the day. And the fact that a coach talks about himself getting hard-ons and his intellectually disabled team getting hard-ons is disgusting and reprehensible. Not to mention against the law. It's the worst movie of the year."
Champions (2023),The Critics just don't know,"If you've ever spent time with adults with developmental or intellectual differences, maybe you'll enjoy this movie more than the critics who didn't get it. Old school, obvious jams? We'll, yeah! Basketball plus people who like familiar music. Some dialogue seems practiced? Yes, it can be common. People acting goofy when they're happy? That was my favourite part of work💓. I watch a lot of dark material, but this was buoyant and fun. I don't find it ""forgettable"", if nothing else because there aren't enough. *actual* diverse films with a diverse cast. Yes, there are plenty of ""jerk out of water"" films, but this was one a pleasure to watch. Plus, basketball! 😀"
Champions (2023),Champions are the best/worst!!!,"This movie is so entertaining I can't get my eyes off the screen! The characters in this movie shows such emotions and it really makes me and my 96 years old bloodhound dog tear up! Throughout the course of the movie my bloodhound showed so many emotions such as excitement and sadness. The basketball team full of disabled people make it so life changing me myself and other who have watched this movie, this shows that anyone can do anything even if you have a severe case of Down syndrome. These are the reasons to why I rated this movie a 10/10, I would strongly encourage this movie to other around them."
Champions (2023),A harmonic crew and performance,"I felt in the movie a great deal of truth and reality, woody Harrison is a great choice for a person who doesn't give a toss about anything then turn to become a person who actually cares and have feelings. The director and cast didn't let the movie fall in the hole of sympathy instead gave us a solid and comforting scene with their acting and drama they give in a mix of comedy and light drama. Have no idea whether those talented actors have performed before but sure they have presence and charisma. The story may be a cliche in which the good intentions and well succeed eventually but the line and the casting have brought a different aspect to the movie."
Champions (2023),Everything you expect,"Yes, it's everything you'd expect, which of course means there are no real surprises. But that's fine, you're not watching this movie to get challenged or to do too much thinking. This movie is all about the feels, and it delivers. Of course, all the supporting cast are inspiring and you can tell that they had fun making this movie. Of course, Woody nails his part as always. But the female lead was my favorite character. She's beautiful, snarky, and has some great one liners. Kudos to the writers for some very witty lines. Kudos to the directors for creating a simple gameplan, drawing it up in practice, and nailing the execution. Oh yeah, it also has Cheech!!!"
Champions (2023),typical sports movie,"This was an okay film. It was the typical sports film, down on their luck team that starts improving with the help of a new coach. It did have some funny moments and the cast did have good chemistry but overall the story is just very simple and predictable. It something to watch if you want to kill some time without having to worry about a convoluted plot. I didn't find it to be as heart warming as it could have been considering it had to do with kids with intellectual disabilities. It needed a lot more drama to make it worth a while. The characters were somewhat developed and each one had their own personality but in the end the story was too cookie cutter."
Champions (2023),Natural born (basketball) players.,"This feel-good sports comedy is essentially the most generic thing you could imagine. Seriously, if you looked up ""generic"" in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure you'd find a picture of this film's poster right beside it. It's exactly what you expect it to be, and it's not even a notably strong version of that. It's really tempting to dock significant points from my score simply because of how uninventive and safe it is. However, and this is a big however, the flick is just good-natured, warm-hearted, solidly executed family fun that puts a smile on your face and keeps you engaged for its undeniably excessive runtime. It isn't deep or important or thematically rich or keenly observed, it's just a simple slice of uplifting fluff that knows what it needs to do and does it fairly well. 'Champions (2023)' is kept afloat by its strong ensemble cast (lead by a grumpy but easy-to-like Woody Harrelson) and its ability to be inclusive without being patronising, allowing its various disabled characters (portrayed by real disabled actors, something which should be a given but sadly isn't) to exist beyond their disabilities and emerge as rounded individuals with character arcs and memorable scenes that don't just reduce them to caricatures. It just gets right what most movies get wrong, which is worth praising even if it's actually the bare minimum a piece of media can do. It's hard not to be won over by it when all is said and done. Of course, it's far from fantastic. It comes with a lot of the same issues that plague its near-identical predecessors, and it's only ever so engaging. Still, it's undeniably enjoyable and sweet (without being particularly cloying), which is really all that it needs to be. If you want something familiar that will make you smile, this might just be the thing for you."
Champions (2023),Good guys don't leave.,"Hot headed basketball coach Marcus Marakovich loses his job after lashing out at his boss, instead of a prison sentence, he's ordered to do community service, and coach a basketball team, with learning disabilities. This is a magical, funny, wonderful, heart warming movie, it's super funny, it's one that tugs at the heart strings, it's genuinely a film I didn't want to end. It's an underdog story in a sense, it's a film that proves that anyone can do anything. Marcus is a bit of a dinosaur, it's his journey that makes this such an utterly engrossing watch. The Friends..... I loved each and every one of them, what a fabulous, talented bunch of individuals they are, I hope I get to see more of these guys in many more films, brilliant all round. Woody Harrelson, he's one of my all time favourites, he never disappoints, as always he's a joy, he's funny, he's natural, he's awesome. Sublime. .....but I still don't understand curling. 10/10."
Champions (2023),The movie definitely has heart.,"IN A NUTSHELL:
The heartwarming film was directed by Robert Farrelly, and written by Mark Rizzo, Javier Fesser, and David Marques. This is the American remake of the 2018 Spanish film Campeones. It's about a former minor-league basketball coach who is ordered by the court to manage a team of players with intellectual disabilities. He soon realizes that despite his doubts, together, this team can go further than they ever imagined. THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic cast stars Woody Harrelson, Cheech Marin, Ernie Hudson, Kaitlin Olson, and Madison Tevlin. Woody Harrelson served as one of the Executive Producers. He and the director worked together on the movie Kingpin back in 1996. The players in the featured basketball game are disabled actors in real life. All of them are real basketball players from the Special Olympics! None of them ever had any acting experience before this movie. The movie definitely has heart. There are a lot of cute road-trip sequences. We don't see NBA-quality basketball, but fans of the game will still get a kick out of game sequences. Keep watching during the rolling credits at the end for a fun treat by Woody Harrelson! THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's extremely formulaic. That being said, the underdog sports formula works VERY well and is always a crowd-pleaser. Not all of the humor lands. Crude conversations that shouldn't be in a movie; otherwise, it could have easily been a family-friendly hit. TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity and 1 F-bomb
The movie starts with a one-night stand. We see an unmarried couple in bed a lot. A woman flips the bird. Farting
Someone projectile-vomits on another person
We see a drunk driver crash into another car. To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!"
Happy Gilmore (1996),"The Price Is Wrong, B***H","Happy Gilmore is a 1996 sports comedy and Adam Sandlers second hit in a starring role. It's about a hockey player who take's up golf in order to win money so his grandmother's house doesn't get repossessed. This is probably my favorite of all of Sandler's films. The comedy is over the top hilarious, and the hotheaded and short fused Gilmore is a such a lovable character that by the end you will be wishing there was a sequel. There is a lot of memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie, and Sandler's fight with Bob Barker has become legendary. This is one of those films that just had everything needed for a great comedy, If you haven't seen this before, I would highly recommend checking out."
Happy Gilmore (1996),Happy Gilmore Review,"Happy Gilmore is a classic comedy that shows a young hockey player who has an extremely short temper and is not afraid to use it. Happy is introduced to golf and discovers he has a unique talent. Happy then joins the tour and meets his soon to be rival Scooter McGavin, who is extremely competitive and plays with an edge. Scooter is the man in the golfing world and Happy challenges his dominance on the course. Adam Sandler does a terrific job and he keeps you laughing throughout the entire movie. After watching this film I think the storyline is very unique and I love the comedic aspect of it. Adam Sandler does a terrific job keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire movie and you never know what to expect next which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Shooter McGavin, played by Christopher McDonald, is an excellent complement to Happy Gilmore with both of them having an excellent sense of humor and knowing how to deliver it the correct way. Something I think could have been done better is showing more of Scooter and how he is looked at by the golf world. Scooter is portrayed as a dominant player but I think his life before Happy Gilmore was not shown enough in the beginning of the film. Adam Sandler has other sports movies and I can see a correlation between Happy Gilmore and The Longest Yard, another favorite of mine. In both movies, Adam Sandler comes together with other athletes to accomplish something that he needs to get done. Golf is the ultimate individual sport and this film does an excellent job of showing how real life golf can get in the way of tournaments being neck to neck and feeling tension during the later parts of the round. Happy Gilmore is a film directed at anyone who enjoys sports and putting its own spin on it with its way of comedy and how it is incorporated into certain parts of the film. It is a family friendly film so anyone can watch it. The director, Dennis Dugan, did a great job adding his own creative twists to different scenes of the movie and having the cast with the ability to execute these to the best of its potential makes for a very entertaining film. To end this review I think Dennis Dugan, Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, and everyone on the cast of Happy Gilmore did a superb job putting together a film that shows you a fun side to golf and delivered a very humorous filled comedy that I would say was a hole-in-one. To rate this film I would give it a 9/10 because it is one of my favorite movies ever and I love comedies so this movie was my type of movie. I love sports also and I play golf as a hobby so I could relate to everything that was going on in the movie so I had a special appreciation for it."
Happy Gilmore (1996),You're Gonna Die Clown,"Whoever heard of a violent sociopathic hockey player becoming a hockey-menacing golfer? Well, Adam Sandler does in his newest movie, ""Happy Gilmore. Not only is this movie hilarious but will have you howling in your seat. He drives a 1974 Plymouth Duster, wears a Boston Bruins jersey and has a short fuse. Happy can't skate well and always seems to be trying out for the high school hockey team. He worships hockey as a kid and develops a power slap shot where he hits the puck so hard he kills his father, who is making home movies in the opening of the film. Since Happy is not a good skater, he is not chosen for the team and humoursly beats up the coach. Happy discovers that his beloved grandmother (Francis Bay) is in trouble with the IRS, and Happy has thirty days to pay $275,000, or they will seize the house. She takes him in after his father's death, so he has to come up with a way to get the money, but what is a hockey wannabe to do? He ends up having to put her in a home where the orderly played by Ben Stiller is anything but orderly. Most of the comedy comes out of Sandler's performance. Early in the film, I think I broke a rib laughing at this; Happy visits the driving range and decides to ""toughen up"" for next year's hockey tryouts, smashing baseballs off his chest. He catches the attention of Veteran Pro Golfer Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), who tries to teach Happy the game of Golf to hilarious results. Happy joins the Pro-AM, where the film's villain appears, Shooter MaGavin (Christopher McDonald.) He becomes threatened by Happy and does everything he can to get him thrown off the tour. He's a snobby rich guy who has been golfing his whole life, and the scenes where Happy's old boss, Mr. Larson (Richard Kiel) makes Shooter run in fear are priceless. Happy and Shooter go mano a mano for weeks before Happy's antics almost get him thrown off the tour. He becomes a media sensation because of his hockey player attitude and, his foul mouth that will have you in stitches when all you hear is beep, beep, beep on the TV intertwined with Happy ranting. Sandler frames Happy as an underdog, and he is. He is a loser in life who loves his grandmother and wants one thing, but through the course of the film, he becomes a winner, as to be expected, but it's how Happy gets there that is entertaining. Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen,) is the public relations director whom Happy tries to win the heart of. She teaches him to control his temper and comes off as a romantic prop more than anything. Happy gets into a humorous fight with Bob Baker on a celebrity AM, and Bob is a lot tougher than he looks. Happy finds himself in trouble with Doug Thompson (Dennis Dugan,) who is the tour manager and also the director. Let the product placement begin. Pepsi, Subway, Pepsi Max, Budweiser, Michelop, AT&T, ESPN, Golf Balls and Heineken when Happy has to find a way to get his grandma's house back. It's to be expected for a sports comedy but it's clever how its include it in the film. Shooter tries to pull a stupid stunt that results in Happy almost humorously beating him up, and that is one of the charms of the movie. Shooter is always in fear of Happy attacking him. Golf is supposed to be a gentle sport, and Happy turns it into a hockey arena. It makes Shooter pissy because he is after something he has been trying to win for years, and because Happy might win it, you see how conniving a rich snob like Shooter can be. Shooter sees Happy as an idiot destroying the game of golf. He has no spine and is arrogant but entertaining for this movie. Christopher McDonald plays him with such weak intentions, that it makes it all that much funnier when Mr. Larson gets him at the end. Yes, Mr. Larson chases him for something stupid that he does, I will not spoil, but it had me fall out of my seat laughing. Shooter runs his mouth only to be met with hostility his snobby ass can't face and when he has to hit a ball off someone's foot, you can't help but start giggling. ""Happy Gilmore"" is a laugh-a-minute comedy that's very funny and entertaining with some good writing and a few good characters. It's not going to win any awards for being any different than other sports comedies with tons of product placement, but Sandler proves he can be very funny and Happy is one of the characters he is going to become known for. He's someone that a lot of audiences will be able to relate to. Happy swearing on TV like an idiot is enough to see this movie."
Happy Gilmore (1996),One of Sandler's better movies.,"Before I review this movie, I would just like to preface that I'm not the most knowledgeable on film production, hence why I will not go much into detail on the camera work, the script, the direction, etc. Now, having said all of that, Happy Gilmore is one of Sandler's better movies. This movie made me laugh. That's a tough thing to do considering I'm not big into comedies, especially nowadays where comedy has lost its raunchiness. I'd say the funniest parts of the movie (in my opinion) is when Happy (Sandler) has his temper tantrums out on the golf course. Christopher McDonald is great as Shooter McGavin and plays the villainous role really well. Overall, solid comedy. 7/10."
Happy Gilmore (1996),"Stupid ball, why don't you just go home!","Happy Gilmore is by far my favorite movie about golf. This movie is so over the top in terms of humor it deserves my 8 star rating. Make no mistake, even though they bleep put the language, it still is understood what he's trying to say. Basic cable actually beeped out the bleeping even more. Adam Sandler is not my favorite comedian but he does have some humorous films. This was my favorite of all his whether you think the guy is funny or not this film is better than caddyshack. I have yet to see Tin cup but for some strange reason think this will still top even that one. I recommend Happy Gilmore."
Happy Gilmore (1996),Peak Adam Sandler,"Happy Gilmore is peak Adam Sandler comedy. This is not only one of his most rewatchable movies but it also has a ton of heart. The stakes are high and the events that unfold are endlessly entertaining. This movie checks all the boxes for a sports movie: a likable (but flawed) underdog protagonist with a chance to prove himself and a despicable villain (Shooter McGavin) in his way. The love interest is weak and some of the story points are outlandish, but it is still a strong comedy. Best Character - Chubbs
Best Quote - ""The Price is Wrong!"" - Happy
Best Scene - Celebrity Golf. Honorable mention to Ben Stiller's Hal the Orderly."
Happy Gilmore (1996),"It's a good story, I just don't think it's hilarious","I know Happy Gilmore was beloved by many teenage boys when it first came out in 1996. However, I was never that big of a fan. It just wasn't my style of comedy. Watching it years later, I think it's an enjoyable movie, but I still don't find it to be that funny. There are definitely a few stand-out moments that made me chuckle, though. Also, it's not just a series of random gags. There's a story here, and the plot gives the movie a solid foundation to stand on, amidst all the ridiculousness. I guess I just prefer the nice & humble Adam Sandler character movies over the cocky & arrogant character ones."
Happy Gilmore (1996),Bob Barkers Got Hands,"This film follows Happy Gilmore, a hockey player who has dreams of making it to the big leagues. When his Grandma is evicted from her home for failure to pay taxes, he turns to golf in order to get the money. Here he meets a rival - Shooter McGavin, and a Woman, Virginia. Happy wins the golf open, defeating Shooter, getting the house and the girl. An absolutely classic movie. I'm glad I returned to it after all these years, as I forgot a fair amount and was surprised more than once by the story and comedy. I love the hockey player and golf stereotypes, as someone who is aware of both - I think they were hilarious and well done. I especially appreciate how Happy draws a non-traditional golf crowd and brings a new spirit to the sport - I've attended golf tournaments and can confirm it pretty vanilla and boring, if a player like Happy was around I would be cheering too. This movie's subtle criticism of golf and its culture is spot on for me and I think the execution was perfect, it mentions it a couple times but all within the means of the story. Personally, being a golfer and avid hockey fan - I just love the premise of the movie. This movie had me cracking up more than once and is just ridiculous at times. It's a truly fun watch, a movie to sit back and just enjoy - no thought, no care, nothing more than superficial characters being funny and playing golf. In terms of characters Shooter McGavin is a standout, Christopher McDonald was a genius casting choice. He's old school, pretentious and conniving - but hilarious at all the above. I played golf today and did the signature shooter celebration whenever I sunk a putt. Ben Stiller and Bob Barker are also hilarious here. I wanted way more of Chubbs throughout the movie. He shows up at the beginning and end but never feels like he has a significant role as Happy's coach. The love interest with Virginia is of course lacklustre as well, not to mention a conflict of interest on the tour. This movies' intention is not to focus on this of course as it's not a character or romantically driven story - but they definitely could have made it a bit more interesting without taking away from the light hearted plot. One second they go on a date the next she's best friends with Happy's mom. Again, understandably not where the writers focused their energy, but little touches in Happy's relationships would have elevated the entire thing. Good family comedys can stilll stick the landing with relationships, this just felt pretty rushed and rough. Overall, Happy Gilmore is an over-the-top comedy with hilarious moments and a subject matter that appeals to me. Fun from start to finish."
Happy Gilmore (1996),This is an Adam Sandler classic and comedic gold,"Happy Gilmore (1996) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows Happy Gilmore, an aspiring hockey player, who stinks at the sport. Meanwhile, his grandmother who raised him, owes back taxes and needs money or she's going to lose her house. He randomly discovers he's good at golf, at least driving the ball, and decides to use his new found skill to earn the money for the house. Unfortunately not everyone playing golf wants him to be successful or on the golf tour. Happy will need to rely on some new friends if he hopes to win enough golf tournaments to save his grandmother's house. This movie is directed by Dennis Dugan (Grown Ups 1 & 2) and stars Adam Sandler (The Waterboy), Christopher McDonald (Thelma & Louise), Carl Weathers (Predator), Kevin Nealon (Weeds), Allen Covert (Grandma's Boy) and Julie Bowen (Modern Family). Everything about this movie is comedic gold. The movie starts tremendous with the opening narration and set up of the main character and circumstances. The soundtrack is brilliant and perfectly selected. The characters are awesome and the good guys are easy to root for and the bad guys are easy to root against. The comedy in this is tremendous with funny circumstances, zings, and random scenarios. The storyline is clever and original. Chubbs will always be one of my favorite comedic characters and the Bob Barker fight is legendary. Overall, this is an Adam Sandler classic and comedic gold. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
Happy Gilmore (1996),A Golf Classic!,"This is, without question, my favorite Adam Sandler movie. The plot for this movie is simple: Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, a good-hearted-yet-ill-tempered former hockey player who starts playing golf professionally because he needs to buy his grandmother's house before the government does. Many people call Caddyshack the ultimate golf comedy. I disagree. Happy Gilmore is the best golf comedy. I would love to see a sequel to this some day. With Adam Sandler and more of the original cast, I'm sure it would be hilarious. They don't make comedies like this one anymore. I give it an A+. Great comedy!"
Believe (I) (2013),"Oh Manchester, so much to answer for.","Believe is a British football movie that finds the legendary Sir Matt Busby (Brian Cox) coaching a kids 7 a side football team. Matt Busby was the manager of Manchester United Football Club, who lost their team of starlets (known as The Busby Babes) to the Munich air crash of 1958. Busby would then go on to rebuild the team and make them into a world force, one that still exists today. Here he is in long retirement exile, but still moulding young football minds. It's based on true events. We have a heavy dose of sentimentality on offer here, not just with the flashbacks to the tragic loss of The Busby Babes, but also to the working class kids of terrace housed Manchester. Of single parents trying to make ends meet, of kids with absent fathers erring on the wrong side of the law, education a dangled carrot just out of reach. However, the sentimentality is not cloying, it's well handled and performed, but the pic never gets to uplift status. It has some good laughs in the mix, usually when Toby Stephens' pompous school tutor is on screen, while the ultimate conclusion - even though it's what we expect - warms the cockles, but it never branches out to be more than just a family film for kiddies who like football, or for Manchester folk eager for anything involving Sir Matt Busby.  It makes for a decent ""B"" movie support to There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, though not nearly as good as that film. Cox, Stephens and the tender Busby Babes sequences (very Field of Dreams) make it worth a watch, but it should have been smarter and better. 6/10"
Believe (I) (2013),Evocative of my childhood,"This is a great true story movie. And its one that you can watch with the whole family, too! It perfectly evokes the England I remember from the early 1980s, as a small boy. Brian Cox always holds your attention, but you're never aware that its Brian Cox, and his work in this film is a perfect example of that. Phillip Jackson, who I often forget is Phillip Jackson is exemplary in his ordinariness, which is to say that he is completely at ease within his character. He is a great English actor. The passion for football (Soccer) that lives within most English children is alive and well in this seven-a-side team that sees it as a natural process of life. The children are exactly the way my football mad friends were, and like us, they're no angels. But you'll love them anyway!"
Believe (I) (2013),What's not to like?,"I felt I needed to add a review for this movie based on the semi-negative review given by another reviewer. He stated that if you're looking for a good movie about football, you should look elsewhere. In essence he's right, but therein lies his problem. Saying ""Believe"" is about football is about as right as saying Americans play football and everyone else plays soccer. *****There will be spoilers here*****  Yes, there are a lot of clichés in the movie but take them with a grain of salt and move on. Of course ""our team"" wins, of course our star player makes it to the field and of course there's a life lesson in it for EVERYONE but that's what makes it such a great movie. This is one of those movies that you're going to smile, you're going to cry and you're going to laugh but in the end you're going to walk away thinking that maybe there's hope for this world. Sir Matt Busby DID in fact work with kids and although there was never something as dramatic as this happen that we know about does not mean it never could have happened. Some of the acting was brilliant especially from the young ones. All in all, this is one of those movies that you can sit back, relax and enjoy it with your entire family, knowing that you'll be happier for having watched it!"
Believe (I) (2013),Very enjoyable family film.,"Believe is a family film about a young lad whose team thanks to a chance meeting get to be managed by legendary Manchester United manager Matt Busby.  The plot is predictable and one we have all seen before however it must be watched on the basis it is a family film and meant to appeal to younger viewers as well. On this basis if like me you have children of a younger age who like football, then it is highly likely they will find this story highly engaging. With a strong British cast and references to Matt Busby and his 'Busby Babes' this is also a film that can be enjoyed by adults as well.  Brian Cox is good as Matt Busby and there is also a nice performance from Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead). The young actors all do good jobs as well.  Believe works as an uplifting and at times touching family drama and as far as family films go this is a very good one. A film that all the family really can enjoy."
Believe (I) (2013),A great family film,"A feel good family film that will be enjoyed by all ages, especially if you're a fan of Matt Busby and/or have knowledge of the Busby Babes. However all the kids in the cinema who knew nothing about the history loved the film. It's raw and unpolished which gives it its charm. The kids in the film are all newcomers, but do a great job. The emotional scene in the car with Matt and Georgie is brilliant! I saw an interview with Brian Cox who said that even established actors find it difficult to ""dig deep"" to find such emotion. Young Georgie ""blew him away"". Comical in parts, emotional (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the flashbacks to the Busby Babes) and you leave feeling uplifted and happy!"
Believe (I) (2013),sentimental beyond belief!,"Why am I wasting my time writing a review for this very average film? Maybe I'm bored at work?  I should of really known better, and did a bit research, this is after all, is a family film. So I guess if you're an 8 year footballer you'll prob love it.  The problem I had it was way to sentimental for my liking. Apart from a few decent tunes from Manchester the music was terrible. It all felt very low budget, the acting was fine but far to clichéd, but if you're a kid you prob wont notice. Basically, I would avoid this film if you're expecting a decent football film and you are above the age of 10."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),Tarantino's best?,"The above headline is always, indeed, a rather difficult choice. Tarantino is definitely one of my, if not the most, favourite of my directors, and for good reasons. Having provided so many unique, thought provoking and overall fun and splendidly put together dramas of all sorts in his own unique flair. This ever acclaimed war drama of his is, however, perhaps the best out of them all. It is a very profound, satirical and beautifully put together piece - with wonderful performances, not the least by Christoph Waltz, among all others. Splendid writing, splendid performances, and overall very beautifully put together in terms of cinematography, cutting and editing. Overall, definitely a great, unconventional and masterful achievement. Highly recommended as ever!"
Inglourious Basterds (2009),One of the best films I ever watched.Such a good story,"""Inglourious Basterds deserves an unequivocal 10/10. Quentin Tarantino's audacious storytelling takes center stage, weaving a riveting alternate history narrative set in World War II. The stellar ensemble cast, led by Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, delivers unforgettable performances. Waltz, in particular, shines with his magnetic portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa, earning him a well-deserved Oscar. The film's dialogue is razor-sharp, complemented by Tarantino's signature blend of tension and humor. Cinematically, it's a visual feast, with masterful cinematography and a soundtrack that adds a distinctive layer. Tarantino's nonlinear approach builds suspense, leading to a cathartic climax. Inglourious Basterds is a triumph, seamlessly merging historical drama, revenge fantasy, and artistic flair, making it a cinematic gem that transcends genres."""
Inglourious Basterds (2009),"I love Tarantino and I watch what ever he makes, but","Tarantino makes a great director, and in this film between the lines, there's one fact well known and he proves
They are blood thirsty so when they are unleashed they kill like basterds, enjoy mutation and most importantly to highlight they never keep a covenant. This director is a genius how he draw the right characteristic of them in a hilarious way though I couldn't smile throughout the movie coz we're in DEC 2023 and we see this live on screens today how they are happy to kill and enjoy it and make rockets that hit civilians as gifts to there lil girls as birthday gifts
How sick is that
this movie sum it all in a cinematic way but message is clear there to be feared just as Nazis."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),Quentin's Masterpiece,"Oh, yeah. Quentin Tarantino, ladies and gentlemen. Ready for an over the top amount of gore and comic scenes. And all of them done to BRILLIANCE! I don't want to comment on the acting and script because I feel like sleeping, so I'll just note that they are top notch. The characters themselves are equally captivating, memorable. The scenes they are in are ridiculous but epic and funny, unrealistically interesting and all thanks to the perfect script that Quentin Tarantino wrote! Personally, I think this is Quentin's best film, and he definitely doesn't have a weak film. In fact, he doesn't even have a mediocre film. Everything of his is 6+/10! CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS MASTERPIECE!!! I'd forgotten. Despite the wonderful Fassbender, Pitt, Kruger, and everyone else, Christoph Waltz makes one of the most iconic roles in cinema history that truly deserves a major acting award. Final Score: 10/10."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),One of Tarantino's Best,"Quentin Tarantino's way of starting his movies in the midst of the action will always catch my attention right away. He truely is one of the greatest cinematic storytellers. Right off the bat, the acting in this is phenomenal, Christoph Waltz' performance as Hans Landa is extremely impressive and I honestly wish I could see more of his character or more characters like him. Tarantino sticks to his roots, making a woman powerful, strong and he doesn't make the women seem like a drag, he gives them purpose which some filmmakers are still unable to do in their work. The story is great and the opening scene is one of my favorites of all time, the discreet details on the pipes showing the status of the two characters, and the unnerving nice persona Hans Landa is using to hunt the Jews is brilliant. His charisma is amazing and portrayed just how it should be. The interrogation scene is also one of my favorites and is done unbelievably well. Tarantino is one of the greatest filmmakers of this generation and I look forward to his final movie."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),"""Who wants' to send a message to Germany?""","There are wild differences of opinion on the socially redeeming value of this film. However, the real film that you are buying this for, ""Nation's Pride"" makes ""Triumph of the Will"" look like a B movie. Not only do you get the complete film but also the Blu-ray version has ""The Making of Nation's Pride"" For the few, that bought the movie to see Brad Pit and Christoph Waltz that movie is not bad either as long as you look at it as an alternate reality of which few people get to partake. However, I did run into these personalities in Vietnam. I only saw the Blu-ray version, but the blood was still realistic and appropriate to the story. We follow the high-jinx of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) as he carves his way across Nazi-occupied France and a potential romance between theater lovers with two different ideologies. The film proves that people do not tend to change. If you like, Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa then do not miss Ron Leibman as Captain Esteban in ""Zorro, the Gay Blade"" (1981)."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),"""Inglourious Basterds"" is a cinematic masterpiece","""Inglourious Basterds"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as one of Quentin Tarantino's finest works. The film is a thrilling blend of history, action, and Tarantino's signature style of storytelling. From the opening scene, the movie grips you with its intense dialogue and the looming threat of danger. Christoph Waltz's portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa, the cunning and ruthless ""Jew Hunter,"" is nothing short of brilliant. His performance is chilling, yet charismatic, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award. The film's narrative is cleverly divided into chapters, each telling a different part of the story, yet all interconnected in the grand scheme of the plot. The Basterds, led by Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine, are a group of Jewish-American soldiers who bring fear to the Nazis with their brutal tactics. Their scenes are filled with Tarantino's trademark violence and dark humor. The movie also excels in its technical aspects. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the grim realities of war-torn France. The soundtrack, as always in a Tarantino film, is eclectic and perfectly complements the mood of each scene. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is not just a movie, it's an experience. It's a daring and unapologetic take on World War II that only Tarantino could pull off. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, making you reflect on the horrors of war and the power of revenge. A must-watch for any cinema lover."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),good,"Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors, and Gang of Degenerates is his masterpiece. To put it bluntly, this movie is a masterpiece. Tarantino really did it perfectly. The dialogues in the film are long, but none of them bores you. You wonder where the dialogues will end up. This also keeps the sense of curiosity always at the forefront. The editing and music of the film are very successful. The film consists of 5 parts. My favorite is 4. So the episode became the bar scene. The end of the film is also very successful. Tarantino 2. He brought his own interpretation to the world war. And as for the actors, especially Christoph Waltz and August Diehl played incredibly. Christoph Waltz deserved the Oscar until the end. In short, according to me, the best 2 made. A world war II movie. Point."
Inglourious Basterds (2009),Exceptional,"When half the movie is subtitled (French, Italian, and German), and you can watch it over and over again finding the brilliance in each actors performance, I'd say that is a masterpiece! Top 3 of Quentin's movies...so far
Waiting on number 10! Hanz Landa and Hugo Stiglitz steal the performances. As well as Eli Roth! The scene when he finally walks out from the ""cave"" is amazing and gives me goosebumps every time I watch this. This is a movie you do have to pay attention to from the beginning to the end and any parts you may miss are probably very important to the overall story. Bravo bravo bravo!"
Inglourious Basterds (2009),A distinct but incredibly good experience.,"The movie starts in the best possible way, introducing the main antagonist with a personality marked by intelligence, coldness, and a strong touch of scrupulousness. From the beginning, the plot builds tension and continues to do so masterfully until the end. This feature film includes some action scenes, quite well-executed with various cuts and different angles that effectively capture the current moment on screen. However, if you're looking for an action film, I wouldn't say this is the right one. Those seeking this type of plot typically want to see many shooting scenes, and while they do occur here, they're not as frequent as expected because the film focuses more on moments of tension. In contrast, violence is consistently present, whether in torture scenes, murder, or shootouts. I would describe this plot as dramatic, bloody, with a considerable dash of action. It's an almost perfect experience for those seeking intense on-screen tension, a good period film, and numerous references to characters that have shaped history. Personally, I loved the direction, plot, and characters, with a significant highlight on the memorable antagonist. However, upon finishing the movie, I felt that something was missing. I think this film could have delved deeper into the protagonist and their allies. At times, the plot doesn't even seem to have a clear protagonist, as it focuses more on other settings and characters than on the main character. On one hand, this could be considered a negative aspect, but for me, it suited the storyline well, ultimately exploring a bit of everything. It manages to delve into the protagonist, the antagonist, and other characters directly linked to those I mentioned. If I were to define ""Inglourious Basterds"" in one sentence, I would say: A different and incredibly good experience. When I went to watch it, I thought it would be good, given Quentin Tarantino's script and direction, and I had seen many praises for this film. Still, I went in without high expectations and ended up liking it much more than I imagined."
Expend4bles (2023),Lazy,"Like most churned out blockbusters nowadays, there is no effort made in any aspect of this film. The nostalgia and fun of the original film is all but gone, a majority of the original cast have moved and and the remaing, with the exception of statham, seem tired and ready to enter the old peoples home. All of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the horrific CGI and lazy set pieces that seem to plague a majority of films these days. Effort and passion are required to keep IP projects alive and flourishing, if stallone and co cant be bothered, then best let them retire to the old age home where memeories and glory days are lived out on daytime TV."
Expend4bles (2023),One of the worst movies ever made,"Easily the biggest hot mess of atrocious acting, bargain basement effects, weakest trope laden story ever. A sleepwalk for all concerned and I feel sorry for all the punters conned out of any cash paid for tickets. By far and away the worst movie of 2023. The biggest laugh comes with the ""US carrier"" which looks nothing even remotely close to a carrier. I mean even at the absolute cursory glance level. Then a geriatric Jason Statham goes at it in full ""invincible"" cheat mode in good old 80s facepalm ridden action tropes. The ""bad guys"" do the ""bad guy"" trope roulette in every scene like the 70s and 80s never happened. Utterly dire in every possible way you can measure dire. Do not waste your money."
Expend4bles (2023),Poor Film,"Some of the scences looked as if it was done on the cheap.. Sorry this film is terrible compared to the original.. the special effects looked fake not like the otger films. The original was really good and the 2nd. The 3rd film was okay but the 4th.. awfu.l. The first scene when Jason Statham and Megan Fox were fighting you could see the poor special effects along with other scenes. I was looking forward to watching this. I am glad i didn't go to the cinema and watch it. It was bad enough on my own 43"" tv. It looked as though the film was rushed and produced by a bunch of amatures considering the good casting. The cast and the acting was great!"
Expend4bles (2023),Must have been written by a five year old...,"Seriously this was awful. The so story could have been good but it was marred by dumb decisions, awful cgi, and shoehorning Megan Fox into a role she has no business being in. The worst part was on the ship where Jason Statham is on a motorcycle shooting bad guys like the thing has perfect aiming ability to then a few seconds later he can't hit the broad side of a barn. Not to mention needing to ""stop"" the ship and instead of disabling the engine or sinking the ship in deep ocean they send up an old 90's tape boom box with modern music on it to make a diversion and start shooting for more crapppy action... Seriously I would say this is written by a person who is in love with the power rangers but decided to put death, gore, and explosions in it."
Expend4bles (2023),Incredibly poor,"The first 3 films were engaging, action-packed and well made. This is utter garbage with the worst CGI ever! The story could have been excellent with the cast that made the other films great entertainment, but this simply lacked .... everything. Wooden acting, utterly useless CGI that made everyone look as though they had just been highlighted by a five-year-old with a crayon. Scenes simply did not make any sense. It is like cameos put together by an amateur with a home movie set, pen, pencil and Stanley knife. The really sad part is that I cannot get the 2 hours of my life back or the £10 that I spent to watch this rubbish in the first place. If you want to watch the best part, watch the trailer and then move on. Don't waste money, time or effort with this turkey."
Expend4bles (2023),I enjoyed it.,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed the movie. It's an enjoyable action flick. That being said, I understand why many do not like it. It's definitely missing many of the key elements of previous Expendable movies. Absent are many of the key expendables. Antonio Banderas is not there, due to scheduling conflicts, he's replaced by Jacob Scipio who plays his son. He really does the job well and is believable, but he plays a very minor role in the movie. In fact almost all the characters are muted and play minor roles. Only Jason Statham has a major role, in fact this really comes off as a Jason Statham move and given how enjoyable he is to watch as an action hero, it's probably why I enjoyed the movie, he carried it well. Meghan Fox is a new addition and Jason's love interest. She's clearly there as ""eye candy"" and is given the role of team leader. She is totally miscast. Out of all the actors, she is the worst in my opinion. She is the only one who appears to be acting. Her lines fall flat. She gives orders and the others appear to play their roles almost ignoring her and making her seem irrelevant. Sadly she's doesn't even fill the ""eye candy"" roll anymore and feels more like a token to fulfill some woke requirement for a female leader. Levy Tran on the other hand plays her role well and comes off much better, although like the rest of the supporting cast holds a relatively minor/muted role. Andy Garcia is always great, but unbelievable as someone going on a such a dangerous mission. He couldn't possibly handle it and it comes off that way. However, as a double crosser he plays the role perfectly. There is no Jet Li, no Mickey Rourke, No Bruce Willis, No Arnold, No Wesley Snipes, No cameos by Harrison Ford, Kelsey Grammer, nor Chuck Norris. Lundgren is there, but seems so old and tired it's hard to believe he could be on such a mission. I know Stallone is older in real life, but still he comes off better, sadly Stallone basically only does what amounts to a cameo in this movie. The story line is sort of weak, however, the action is very good, plenty of explosions and I think this one is the bloodiest of the franchise. All in all even with all the above, I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Statham is able to carry it forward I just wish there was more Stallone."
Expend4bles (2023),CGI by Atari,"Wow . This is unbelievably bad . I paid for this but had to turn it off after no more than 5 minutes.. The CGI is laughable, Ms fox looks like she is filtered more than my morning coffee and the dialogue is shocking .......
The first 2 films are great , the 3rd not so much . But this is embarrassing.. gone are all the stars .. in comes a bunch of unknowns , maybe they were trying to save money . Looking at the CGI , they must have ..there's even a cameo for that great British thespian Eddie Hall .. This CGI looks like it's off the last star fighter .. please please please please please please don't waste your time or money."
Expend4bles (2023),Great Movie,"I have no idea what is with people now days & their crap ratings on things but this is a great movie & well worth the watch though to be perfectly honest I thought it wouldn't be that great being a lot of movies with good ratings are trash, and a lot of good ones have low ratings. I guess I am going to have to start watching the ones with bad or low ratings to watch something worth seeing. If you were born alive during the time when we did not have cell phones or social media you might enjoy this movie & should definitely give it a chance! I mean seriously why would you listen to the rating from people who chose to text from 3 feet away from each other instead of using their mouths to communicate or who do not understand the concept of common sense? Its a great movie, and I give it 10 stars. Love it or hate it, I don't care I loved it!"
Expend4bles (2023),Decent(ish) movie but the worst by far.,"I can honestly say it was bad enough that it made me write my first IMDB review. First the casting, Megan Fox, 50 Cent & Andy Garcia just didn't fit this movie. Megan Fox being passed off as some sort of bad ass who's now an Expendable? 50 Cent is decent in the movie & somewhat takes over the massive void left by Terry Cruise. Andy Garcia tries to pass off as one of the boys & go on mission, um no. As with most other reviews I've seen I agree the CGI was just BAD & I mean parts of it were low budget straight to home release bad. In the end it's a Statham lead spin off with 10-15 mins of Stallone & a really weak supporting cast. The majority of it is 2 scenes of nonstop explosions & knife fights with a plot you can see coming a mile away."
Expend4bles (2023),Worthless unlistenable dialogue,"The earlier films had plot, humor and dialogue that fit. This waste of time the writers or producers felt they had to appeale to the trash-talking rap crowd by littering every place in the script with profanity. ALomost none in the first few films and they made a profit. With this change, catering to a democgraphic that does not purchase tickets, they are taking a bath, and a well-deserved one. Clean it up, Sly and you'll make a profit. Tey say I have to have at least 600 words in order to post, so... I really do not have anything more to say. Hollywood has decoided to go after the lowest common denominator. This is an example."
The Covenant (2023),The end of the movie,"What i dont understant on this movie...is everything is going under the description of possibilities about the war story in Afganistan. The end on the movie when they are in tha plan departing for US, John gives the documents which supose to be the visas for Ahmed his wife and his child...but when Ahmet turns other side of visa documents its writen your visa is approval but there is a US passaport. Why do you need a visa approval when you have a US passaport issued by US authories. Its funny part of the movie...thats dont make a sense...having visa approval and the passaport from US. Scenario is very good and lots of scenes are adopted vey professional. But the end of movie with those documents make me to smile and it was a funny part."
The Covenant (2023),Great movie showing a different side to the war against the Taliban.,"When a devastating ambush leaves Kinley critically wounded, his life is saved by Ahmed (Dar Salim), a loyal Afghan interpreter. The two men forge an unbreakable bond, and when Kinley learns that Ahmed's family has been denied safe passage to America as promised, he embarks on a mission to rescue them from the clutches of the Taliban. This side of the war, the interpreters (and their families), is one you don't see often, and Dar Salim plays the role perfectly. Ritchie's signature style, characterized by sharp dialogue, dynamic camerawork, and a penchant for over-the-top action, is fully on display, but it is his ability to balance action and emotion that elevates the film. 9/10."
The Covenant (2023),Extremely compelling,"Very well acted. Extremely compelling. Felt like I was there with the characters the whole time. Highly recommend even if you wouldn't normally watch this genre. Rather than the characters being likeable they are real and a reflection of their situation and the stress they are under. The acting conveys this beautifully. There is nothing gratuitous about the cinematography, but it also properly conveys some of the horror and reality of the time and place. The fact that both my wife and I, who have varied tastes, were hooked the whole time spoke volumes of the quality of the movie. It's a difficult thing to achieve in a movie and yet it was done with a relatively modest budget and a largely unknown cast."
The Covenant (2023),Great Action and Lots of Heart,The Covenant is a very good movie. The film has excellent action sequences and Guy Ritchie directed the movie very well. His direction really makes you feel like you are there with the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal and Antony Starr are great in this movie just like they always are. And I wasn't familiar with Dar Salim before this movie but he also gave a good performance here. The characters are very good in general and you really grow to care for them. I also love how this movie brought told the story of an interpreter during America's time in Afghanistan. It gets you to realize how tragic that situation was and how so many people are still living out the negative results of the war in Afghanistan. The script is predictable for the most part but it's still a touching story and a thoroughly entertaining time overall. 8/10.
The Covenant (2023),Nothing new but really solid,"A refreshing departure of style for Ritchie. The screenplay & pacing have a surprising flow with pounding suspense. It's predictable but worthwhile. The filler shots pop with Gyllenhaal nailing his role. .

The Covenant (2023),"Good movie, story and action. Fails massively on props","I liked the movie and it was well worth my time. The story is about a covenant that is made between a sergeant and his interpreter. The interpreter saves the sergeant which means he's marked for life and there's a bounty on his head. Solid action and intense fights. It is not as others say predictable. It kept me interested throughout the whole movie. Jake does a terrific work on his role and I loved his part. He has a good chemistry with the actor playing the interpreter and he also brings a lot t the table. BUT, and it's a big but... the movie would have gotten 8/10 if it was not so sloppy with pretty obvious details and props. Every gun and rifle is an Airsoft gun with tape over the gas valve, every rifle is a Hk model and shining new. All clothing and gear is shiny new... takes away the realism a lot. . I can not comprehend how the bloopers are missed. In one scene Jake takes out his hk pistol, gives it to Ahmed and when the angle changes Ahmed is holding a m9 beretta. In one scene Jake is holding a, what seems, makarov in his lap where the mantel is locked in empty... next angle when his standing up his holding a Glock copy that is mantled. Loses 2 stars for really sloppy details and realism..."
The Covenant (2023),Rambo and Commando reinvented,"The film was quite promising up to the first action scene. From there, the downhill slide began. Towards the end, the downhill slide became even steeper and the film ended up being another clichéd Hollywood bulk production with the formula used hundreds of times. I had just watched Kilo Two Bravo, which was about the same protracted operation in Afghanistan. Kilo Two Bravo was well made and believable. This was neither, but represented a childish male macho culture. The film was ultimately reminiscent of Rambo and Commando. The Taliban fell in rows as the assault rifle was just barely pointed at them. Even with a pistol, it was easy to kill from a longer distance. Credibility, credibility and credibility. The film tried to be serious. Therefore, the film could have tried to be credible at least on some level. It also seemed like vague American world-saving propaganda, even though the film did try to loosely highlight some problems with the whole Afganistan operations."
The Covenant (2023),Gritty,"Versatile, brutal and gritty - the right movie with the right Director and main actor. Guy Ritchie is well known by his frenzied and energetic filming style and this one not escape the pattern - as with Jake Gyllenhaal that is a well suited actor for action movies (ans strange to remember him in Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain to show as versatile as he can be). Gritty and realistic story (not based on a single story but in a collective of stories of true events), where a US MArine saves a Afghan interpreter life after they fall behind enemy lines. Expect a more realistic and tense movie till the end - if you like war movies this is for you. Filmed on Spain as the real territories of Middle East are dangerous to film into (with some exceptions as Jordania). Engaging enough to link the emotional links between war translators (usually locals, that were observed closely) and their marine squads, it shows little pieces of both protagonists life's into a long and dangerous road toward rescue. Score: 8,0 out of 10.0 / A-, as I am a fan of war movies."
The Covenant (2023),I wish there was more emphasis on realism,"This movie is a solid effort from Guy Ritchie that falls down when you look at the A-Team, John Wick level of absurdity with many of the action sequences. The script and story are quite good and this is worth your time if you are a fan of military action movies. My wife who is not an action film buff liked it for the drama elements. Dozens of combatants being taken down by instant kill headshots, people running into lethal gunfire without trying to use cover or concealment, bullets flying everywhere and yet the protaganists slip through unscathed. Gets tiring after a while. A bit more military accuracy would have gone a really REALLY long way with this film. Otherwise pretty solid film."
The Covenant (2023),"Mediocre movie, overrated and predictable","After taking a look at the abundance of positive reviews had to write this. I wanted like this movie, especially because Jack G usually picks good movies to be in, but even he cant save this one. Actually I found his performance pretty flat and underwhelming, disappointing from such a good actor. Dar Salim was excellent, wish he had more screentime. There were some good action scenes, but overall the action consisted of just a lot of guns being fired. The best thing was the music, such a beautiful soundtrack, better than any of the mediocre dialogue. Yeah, the script/dialogue did not sound authentic in any way. I found the whole concept of movie very US sided, obviously it is a US film but they could have shown more Afghans perspective, why interpreters take these jobs, what happens to them later etc. The whole heroic US soldier storyline is really a bit too cliché. You also know from the beginning that this is going to be a happy ending, so no surprises there. I give 6 because of the soundtrack and beautiful scenery of Afghan land."
Last Flag Flying (2017),A grim reminder of the cost and comradery of serving,"I had seen clips of this on Tik Tok which got me interested in watching. Bryan Cranston giving the business to the come colonel in a mix of a boston/new york accent. It was pretty funny in a serious type of way. I was not prepared for this movie. My family has a long history of service. My wife's and my grandfathers served in WW2 and Korea in the Army and Air Force. My father served in the Navy. I served in the Air Force. My brother served in the Army. One of my grandparents, and both of my wife's grandparents that served are gone. And my brother is gone. None of them died in combat, so I can't imagine the type of grief coming from not knowing, this particular story paints a very real picture of the type of bond and brotherhood that can only come from the men and women that served together. And that will lose each other. Eventually. The raw emotion, especially during the final two scenes. It was almost too much. The characters work together beautifully, and Cranston and Fishbourne's characters act like a devil and angel on Steve Carrell's shoulders, guiding him as he is making this journey to his son's final burial. The way that the characters interact with one another, and the type of chemistry, and depth that you see in Cranston in Carrell is incredibly touching. These men did a great service to the families of those that served, and to those that served as well. A beautiful story that I would whole-heartily endorse that anyone see."
Last Flag Flying (2017),Slow Salute!,"I didn't know it was a Linklater directed movie until I came here to see how the movie was rated...When I saw Cranston, Fishburn and Carrell involved. I figured it should be at least entertaining! Watching the three former marines rekindle their long lost relationships was wonderful to see. As a veteran (USAF) Movies about anything military are usually hit or miss with me. Often, ""they"", the producers, writers et al. Get it wrong and it becomes either a propaganda commercial for the MIlitary Industrial Complex or a Hit piece against the military paradigm. This movie was neither. It's a beautiful story of a father and son's relationship, the last moments of the film are where the emotions come forward. Cranston and Fishburn in their dress blues giving their slow salute to The father and the son is very poignant... The letter; was so perfectly placed. A bittersweet movie of the highest order. Well worth the watch!"
Last Flag Flying (2017),"""I Was Wondering If You Guys Could Come With Me""","That line and a few others in this film almost broke me. There are very few, and I mean only a small handful of films that make me shed tears. Had I not paused this film those couple of times and taken some breaths, I would have had completely broken down for sure. The acting by all three is a force of nature. Bryan Cranston in particular was outstanding. Huge respect for all these guys, because I firmly believe you cannot do a role like this without having that respect and reverence for actual combat veterans. Regardless of politics, every soldier or marine will tell you, it all goes out the window when bullets are flying. You fight for your brothers or sisters next to you. When you've gone through it, regardless of the war, the feeling of camaraderie and respect for each other is inexplainable."
Last Flag Flying (2017),"WOULD HAVE SOOOO MUCH BETTER WITH HALF THE FOUL, FILTHY LANGUAGE","C-- About a Veteran Navy corpsman who served in Viet Nam. He went looking for his two buddies from his time serving with the Marines in VN. A he found them, one was a Preacher and the other owned a bar. After visiting awhile, he told them the reason he looked them up. He had to go to Dover AFB to pick up the remains of his only child, a son, who was killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, I don't remember which. He wanted to view his son's remains but was told that it was not recommended. That's when he was told that his son dies by a shot in the back of his head by a sniper, when he was getting Cokes for his buddy, not in a firefight. The father doesn't want his son buried in Arlington. They rented a truck to take him home to NJ. He wants his son to be buried in his graduation suit, not his dress blues but his son's best friend, who is the escort, says that his sin bulked up and the suit wouldn't fit. The father agrees to allow him to be dressed in his dress blues. The story is a great one. The problem is the excessive use of foul, filthy language. I understand that it is used in the military, but I served for 26 years, and that language wasn't allowed in uniform. I did NOT serve in combat, so I can't say anything about the language there, but all the military doesn't speak like that."
Last Flag Flying (2017),First-rate buddy movie about Vietnam veterans,"It's a buddy movie set in the summer of 2003 in places ranging from Newport News, Virginia, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It follows three Vietnam veterans traveling together to bury the Marine son of one of them who has just died in Iraq. ""Last Flag Flying"" has three principal characters. Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Steve Carell) was still a teenager when fighting in Vietnam. An incident involving the other two men resulted in his military imprisonment for two years before a dishonorable discharge. His wife, with whom he had a good marriage, has recently died of breast cancer. His son, Larry Jr., was just killed in Iraq. Doc has a lower-level clerical position and seems naturally quiet and introverted. After decades of no contact, Doc locates his two former comrades to ask them to join him in receiving Larry, Jr.'s body at Dover Air Force Base and probable burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) is a cynical, rough-hewn bar owner in Newport News with a metal plate in his head that may have impacted his confrontative personality. Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) discovered evangelical faith after leaving the Marines and is now the pastor of an African American Baptist church in Virginia. The film follows Doc's efforts to engage his former comrades and their travels together to receive Larry Jr.'s body and ultimately take it to New Hampshire after he learns more about his son's death. During the movie, we learn more about the critical event in Vietnam. Key secondary characters include Colonel Willits (Yul Vazquez), a manipulative Marine officer; Corporal Charlie Washington (J. Quinton Johnson), Larry Jr.'s best friend in the Marines; and the U-haul truck rental clerk (Jane Mowder). ""Last Flag Flying"" is slow-paced but appropriately unfolds each character's personality. Larry warms up as their time together lengthens, and Sal and Richard come to greater accommodation after surviving earlier sparks. Sal introduces humor to the drama, and there is one great scene where they all remember a trip to ""Disneyland."" The events around the U-haul truck rental don't work, though it's crucial to the plot. There are also a few wonky edges to the ending. But all-in-all, ""Last Flag Flying"" is a first-rate story about three guys who served their country, don't regret it, but are very cynical about what their government is doing in foreign lands."
Last Flag Flying (2017),Tender and Honest,"Discovering Last Flag Flying on Amazon Prime was a joy for me for a couple of reasons. Firstly, It's directed by Richard Linklater, who is hands down one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. Secondly, it stars Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne, all of whom do a terrific job. And thirdly, the film is an unofficial sequel to Hal Ashby's The Last Detail, a movie that I first discovered just a few years ago and became a big fan of. Last Flag Flying is both a funny and touching film that explores powerful themes such as grief, patriotism, and friendship. Linklater does a remarkable job balancing humor with drama and the chemistry between our main cast is exceptional. Steve Carell in particular gives a remarkably gentle and sympathetic performance that honestly made me well up at times. I love seeing him take on more dramatic roles. I'm sure he will get that silly gold statue at some point in his career, he's too talented not to. As I mentioned prior, Last Flag Flying is an unofficial sequel to The Last Detail. Both films were based on books by Darryl Ponicsan. I believe in the book, Last Flag Flying, the three lead characters are the same ones from The Last Detail and the novel revolves around them decades later after the first story. Now, as much as I would've enjoyed seeing a proper sequel to The Last Detail, it simply wouldn't have worked without bringing back Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, and Otis Young. So I think the decision to make this film a stand-alone movie with different characters that utilize the same themes as the first film was a good idea. My only real nitpick for Last Flag Flying is that it could've easily had 15 minutes or so cut out, which would've tightened up the pacing. And because of the movie's slow pace and serious subject matter, it's not a film I see myself returning to all that often. But regardless, I think Last Flag Flying is a very well-made film with great direction by Linklater and awesome performances from our lead cast. If you're a fan of The Last Detail and you've yet to see Last Flag Flying, you should check it out."
Last Flag Flying (2017),Last Flag Flying,"Vietnam vet Steve Carrell calls on his ex comrades Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne to take him to collect and arrange the burial of his son, a marine, who was killed in Iraq a week earlier. The three are very different characters who haven't seen each other in a long time, but through the course of the film build an incredible loving friendship again - not without much drama, argument and no little hilarity along the way. The film is apparently a sequel of sorts to Hal Ashby's 'The Last Detail' starring Jack Nicholson and slthough they are largely unconnected, the spirit certainly remains. Whilst the story of getting Carrell's son back home in defiance of marine protocol which wants him at Arlington, this is in many ways a bit of a maguffin. What keeps this so fresh and alive is the three utterly glorious characters we stay with throughout the film and the terrific performances by 3 great actors. It is often very dramatic and indeed quite touching without getting cloying and at times, utterly hilarious - their recollections of Carrell losing his virginity are just so funny. The 3 though, Cranston, alcoholic and brimming with good humour, Fishburne, a priest who has forgotten joy and finds it and possibly best of all Carrell, in the quietest of the three parts, struggling with his loss are such good company and that's the reason for watching this - the great company."
Last Flag Flying (2017),a melancholy comedy-drama from Amazon Studios,"Vietnam vet Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Steve Carell) tracks down a pair of his old military friends: foul-mouthed and hard-drinking barkeep Sal (Bryan Cranston), and minister Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Doc asks his two friends to accompany him to pick up the remains of his son, a Marine killed in Iraq. The three men set out on an odyssey to have the young man buried and to perhaps put some old ghosts to rest themselves. This was based on the 2003 novel by Darryl Ponicsan, which was a sequel to his 1970 novel The Last Detail, which was memorably filmed in 1973 with Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid. Linklater, who co-wrote the script with Ponicsan, decided to alter this follow-up in several ways, changing the character names and a lot of their back story, but the essential dynamic is the same. I enjoyed this film well enough, but as a big fan of The Last Detail, I spent much of this movie's runtime comparing it, and wondering what might have been had this been filmed 15 years ago and with the original film's cast returning to their roles (Otis Young passed away in 2001, before the sequel novel was published). Seeing at least Nicholson and Quaid return in those roles would have been really something else. All that aside, this is still a largely enjoyable movie, with good performances and some nice, quiet character moments. The film seems to want to say something about veterans, and what they feel and how they deal with the rest of their lives, and how they end up viewing their country that they sacrificed for but who may have ultimately been lying to them. However, the script doesn't put these thoughts together in a clear enough fashion to be making any kind of definitive statement, but it may be the case that there really isn't one. It's odd to think that a movie set in 2003 is a period piece, but it is, and much is made of a visit by the three aging buddies to a cell phone store to check out the new-fangled technology. I'm curious how this movie will be viewed by actual Vietnam-era military veterans."
Last Flag Flying (2017),Awesome over the top,Anyone who's seen combat or done military time will connect to this movie to your core..I did anyway. Cried through a good part of it and laughed too. Soo many points well made and taken if you were paying close attention. Did 10 years with the air national guard and was combat trained but was never deployed but every time I got on a C130 all I could think of was every soldier who took that flight to a war zone. I'm an empath to a fault so appreciated every facet of this production. BRAVO. Graduated hs in 71 so my military time was later and ended with Desert Storm. Was active duty for medical training and it was winding down as I finished. Couldn't have picked a better cast.
Last Flag Flying (2017),Not bad,"Being a Marine myself I had a little vested interest in the story. Overall the movie was good and had some great scenes that made it quite enjoyable. The acting was solid for the most part and I'm really convinced Steve Carell can do just about anything. Such a well versed actor. The story has its moments and even though the subject manner is deep, the writers do a decent job keeping it light with some funny moments. The thing that dropped it down a few spots for me is the lack of research when dealing with Marine Corps customs and uniform. All it would take is to have a real Marine on set to give input on do's and don'ts. It won't matter to most but when they screw up the simplest thing of proper hair cuts and NO FREAKIN beards it's just so disrespectful to those of us that wear the uniform and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Anytime they put an actor in a military uniform they should at least get things right. I guarantee that makes a difference on what hundreds of thousands of veterans think about a movie or tv show. Getting things right on appearance is the very least a producer could do. Anyway the movie is good.... Not great but good. If Steve Carell wasn't in it I'd probably give it a 5."
The Deer Hunter (1978),One Shot,"This movie was quite a watch. I've known the main theme for years and it's in the same vein with ""Cinema Paradiso"" that the soundtrack does a lot for me. Other than the soundtrack, the movie was still a solid watch. The first act is a little tough to get through because you'd expect that these ""ordinary life"" scenes wouldn't last an hour but it does. It's obviously a very tight-knit community and the director takes his liberty in portraying that. I get the point was to contrast with the horrors of Vietnam but still it was a little too long, which is why this movie is not a 5 for me. The rest of the movie was fantastic. The Russian Roulette scenes were thrilling than it anything else. There is no other game that combines lives and chance like this. Young De Niro, Walken and Streep were such a pleasure to watch. This movie does not show much of the typical ""battle scenes"" but it really focuses how the war has touched those involved in it. Nick's transformation after seeing the futility of life in war goes mad and participates in more of these games. His death is tragic (you need a little suspension of belief that he's survived all these games and became a legend) and heart-wrenching. I've started to watch some of the well-known war movies and this was one of the very first movies to discuss the most pointless war in history, Vietnam War. Its simple storytelling starts from the lives of those involved in it and contrast it in a most dramatic way possible with those who were in the war vs not. I may have given it a 4 if not the beautiful soundtrack by Stanley Meyers but still a very good watch."
The Deer Hunter (1978),"Flaws, flaws everywhere...","I had a blast watching this movie, but seriously, ""Deer Hunter""? It's like they were playing a game of random word association. Why not jazz it up with titles like ""Vietnam Roulette"" or ""The Effects of War""? At least those sound like they belong in a movie, not a deer fashion show! And speaking of long, this movie dragged on like a sloth on a Monday. I could have whipped up 20 waffles in the time it took for anything interesting to happen. If you're looking to kill time, this ain't the funniest way to do it, unless you find waffle-making riveting cinema. This movie's length had me contemplating starting a deer hunter support group for those who survived the marathon. Happy hunting sir!"
The Deer Hunter (1978),Too good for words.,"The Deer Hunter (1978) is about raw emotion, pain and what war can do to it's different characters, the mental scars it leaves behind. Several young friends from a gritty working class background celebrate a wedding together in the late 1960s, we spend a lot of time with them during this early sequence. They also deer hunt together. Christopher Walken is also in the film playing a likeable character as is Robert De Niro, again actually playing a fairly likeable character for a change. Walken in particular is actually kind of shy but sweet. The wedding party is a great rumpus of fun and festivity really well directed, the smoke, the music, the warmth, the dancing, the giddiness of it all. We cut then to some of the most brutal, violent and authentic war footage you'll have seen in film before 1978. There's a very very long sequence of our characters now POWs held captive and forced to play a deadly game for the entertainment of their captors. These are men who thought the war would be just like going deer hunting and could have had no idea of how bad it would really get. Walken's scene where he breaks down is wonderfully filmed and acted, so much is done in one long wide take. The third act shows how the characters attempt to transition back to normal life which is so hard for them after what they've just been through. The film gave me a new appreciation for De Niro, he doesn't just play gangsters it turns out. It's partly a film about emotional blindness too with many of the ex soldiers repeatedly telling each other they're fine when clearly they're not. There's also an unrequited love in this which I thought was handled very well and very tastefully."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Crushing with Subtlety,"A visceral and soul-crushing film that gets there through balancing intensity with subtlety, rapidity with a drawn-out patience. The scenes that stick with you may make it hard to remember how much restraint and subtlety is present here. The scenes of Russian Roulette are impossible to forget: the frantic screaming, the silent buildup, the absolute unknown with each pull of the trigger. It is helpless and simple and disturbingly random. The pains and screams of De Niro for his friend are nothing short of pure anguish, pure love, pure fear and frustration. And the unfeeling, excited audience makes it all the more unsettling. But with a three hour run time, most of the scenes are not life or death. They are the quiet life, love that can't be, getting drunk and goofing around with your friends. It made me aware of the kind of dully obvious expectations my current diet of movies/television have given me. I kept expecting the bold and extreme dramatic twist: the passionate confession of love to your friend's girlfriend, the accidental killing of a friend during the deer hunting trip, even the combat death of a character during the Vietnam war. Instead, the twist is in the subtlety, the underhanded but ultimately far more compelling (and closer to real life) dramatic event. De Niro doesn't confess his love to Meryl Streep at their friend's wedding. He watches her dance; he smiles at her in passing; he lights up when she dances in his arms--temporarily taking Walken's place on the dancefloor; they wait for beer together and stare into each other's eyes and lean in a little for just a second, but they don't kiss, and there is no awkwardness, they simply go back to the way things were. The deer hunting trips don't leave anyone killed or injured; they play out subtle moments of characterization, rising tension, and the deep contrast to De Niro's desire to kill a deer prior to the war and inability to do so afterwards. The war is horrific, but no character dies in conflict. One is left permanently maimed; one is left entirely mentally and emotionally detached, blindly marching down a suicidal path; one is left to pick up the peaces and try his best to return to an old way of life. Consistently it is the subtler route in events that becomes the most moving and ultimately the most heartbreaking. The result is something that feels almost documentary: the real life of its soldiers, the real events abroad and at home, and the real wounds of war."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Magnificent cinema,"I love how the first half is the jolliness and the 2nd half is darker! One of the best aspects is how young the entire cast was and how soothing the directing was back then so different. Deer Hunter is genuinely a great work of art I didn't realize how long it is; I'm glad to have caught a chance to watch it before it leaves Netflix. A spectacular manly gem with bonding, beauty, madness, wild behavior, plenty of alcohol, and plenty of charm! Crazy to think Deer Hunter is 44 years old - such a classic. I don't watch oldies enough they were made so genuine I imagine most filming wasn't as difficult back then, except for The Shining having loads of takes."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Deadly roulette of any name,"A powerful movie, a well-made one, distinctly divided in three parts (almost) like a fine neat three-part mini-series. It has quality production, quality powerful acting obviously (one of De Niro's best. He showed craziness, class and courage), but minimally suffers from explanatory development, especially regarding to Steven, after his injury and pull back and Nick (most of all) who wasn't shown exactly how he got to that level of depressive, sort of PTSD degenerative amnesia. That's above all a very emotional movie, I wasn't spared either and a classic, in my opinion way above Apocalypse Now. P. S. Meryl Streep looks so beautiful and talented as an actress in 'The Deer Hunter' and most of her 70s-90s works. Screenplay/storyline/plots: 7.5 Development: 8.5 Realism: 8.5 Entertainment: 8.5 Acting: 8.5 Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5 VFX: 8 Music/score/sound: 8 Depth: 8 Logic: 7 Flow: 8.5 Drama/war: 7.5 Ending: 7.5."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Skip this one,"Positives: This film features spectacular filmmaking and performances. I hope it helped to heal vets and their loved ones and to inspire the pursuit of truly informed consent among prospective military personnel. The opening act depicting a Russian Orthodox wedding establishes a nuanced portrait of the characters' tight-knit community. Negatives: The script suffers from illogical plot points, propogandist absolutism, and almost universally unlikeable characters - a flaw most visible in the protagonist, a man whose every act reeks of a hypermasculine fantasy of melancholic heroism. It posits the Americans' selfishness, reckless hubris, and violence as reflective of either their youthful elan or their wounded spirits. Meanwhile, Vietnamese humanity is largely erased on favor of demonically sadistic drama, as demonstrated by the fact that the only words we hear from any of these characters (if you can call them that) are the propositions of sex workers whose tragic existences are met with pure scorn and revulsion."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Simply a masterpiece but....,"First, I understand that so many folks dislike this film, because of the useless lengths - for instance the endless wedding sequence - that could discourage the most patient people in the world. I think this masterpiece should have been better edited, the director Michael Cimino should have deleted some scenes, but I guess Cimino threatened to kill himself if producers forced him to go to the cutting room with a blade. Many films in history are concerned with this problem, and on the other hand , on the contrary, many movies have been cut, gotten rid of so terrific sequences that could have brought so much to them. Back to this film, of course it is powerful, awesome, terrific on every way, despite those lengths. It is an unforgettable masterpiece which no one can forget."
The Deer Hunter (1978),Harrowing Vietnam War drama,"The Deer Hunter is a 70's classic with an ensemble cast of Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage and Meryl Streep. Often classified as a Vietnam War movie, a very small portion of the film has any scenes from the war. It is much more about the effects from the war that it had on this small Slavic American community in a working class town in rustbelt Pennsylvania. This is writer/director Michael Cimmino's best work and most successful film. The film is very bleak and often depressing. If this film was made today, I doubt it would have the same impact. Of course with top tier performances from some of the finest actors anywhere, The Deer Hunter is hard to beat. There is a lot about this film that is dated, but the themes are relevant to anytime and it shows how wars shatter generations and leave wounds( both physical and emotional) that never heal."
The Deer Hunter (1978),So-so,There were some aspects to this movie I really liked like the showing of the depth of the friendship before the three young kids are thrown into a hellish war together. It was a little jarring to hear everyone constantly talk over each other but it felt like a very natural small town vibe where three friends go off to war and it not only shows the impact on them but by those they left behind as well. Robert De Niro is great and so is Christopher Walken. I don't know how big a name those guys were before this but it's certainly something that could make them. The wedding felt too long though and the entire plot being more or less focused on Russian roulette was a bit disappointing to me. Once they shot their way out of one I figured that'd be it but Walken pretty much must have decided he wanted to die because he did it voluntarily after that. It was a sad movie and a bit too long and lacking something for me. It's worth the watch to see the two actors performances though.
Sisu (2022),Sisu,"At the end of WWII, the nazis are leaving Finland and applying a scorched earth policy. A platoon lead by a sadistic commander, come across a lone gold prospector and decide to take his gold. What they didn't count on was that this man is a legend known for his mythological immortality and that he will not ever ever give up - the Finnish word for this is sisu. Apparently influenced by 'First Blood', this hysterical barrage of vicious blood letting actually makes Rambo look like a bit of a pxxxx. This is so way way over the top with endless gory deaths applied to every soldier as our man slowly works his way through the platoon. Not only that, but his apparent immortality enables him to survive all manner of vicious attacks on his person. This extraordinary pantomime draws to a completely daft and unbelievable climax and yet the whole thing is terrific fun and ideal if you're fond of seeing sadistic nazis sprayed all over the Finnish countryside - and let's face it, who isn't."
Sisu (2022),I hoped that it would be better,"I came into this movie expecting the type of entertaining lowish budget actions movies that have come out in the last decade. Visceral and hard-hitting...and came away disappointed. There's tons of action, and the cinematography and acting is competent...but far too many of the action scenes are just too unrealistic. The guy blocks a heavy machine gun's bullets with a mining pan that he holds in his hands like it's Captain America's shield...I actually went back thinking that he picked up a tank hatch or something...but no a thin piece of steel is stopping bullets. Far too many of the action scenes rely on these outlandish premises. It's not that Sisu is a skilled and determined soldier seeking bloody revenge...he's a freakin' super hero. It does feel like those sequences were done to look impressive, without actual thought to making them believable. Which undermines the entire film, and the premise that he's just gutting it through. This movie would have been so much better if they grounded it a lot more. Why not have him come up for a breath instead of literally sucking the air out of gaping neck wound? Why not have him dive for cover instead of tanking HMG rounds? There's just so many baffling decisions that take away from the movie that the good scenes (and there are several) really made me wonder why there couldn't have been more of those type of sequences instead. Most action movies are not realistic...but the best avoid disrupting the suspension of disbelief. In this case the movie more-or-less jumps the shark from the first major action sequence, and never really gets back in the groove. An interesting, yet wasted premise...I don't regret watching it, it was fairly entertaining, but I'll probably never watch it again."
Sisu (2022),"good action, not so good story","The movie was quite good, i really liked the combat and the gore that was placed wihtin it. Altho i think the story was kinda lacking, the only reason he survived is because he refuses to die/give up. Fun but not super entertaining, the nazi's where also quite boring and did not feel like real threats, more like cartoon villains, except for the commander who was a real challenge. This movie however did not dissapoint with the side plot (the women). Compared to movies from disney these women are not strong or smart because they are women, but because they went through stuff and got help from our big friend. It was a fine movie but i would not watch it again."
Sisu (2022),Monty Python rides again!,"Of course, by the first encounter with the Nazis, our Hero would have died. The story is rubbish, however the effects, camera work, photography, and sound are impressive. Having said that, it doesn't any contribute positive reasons to holiday in Lapland. But full marks to the actors and crew for enduring the bleak weather, mozzies, and liberal application of the Kensington Gore! I have a great regard for Finland, it has a heroic history, even more so now with it's belligerent neighbour Mr. V. Putin. I imagine that Sisu is a kind of executive relief for the sado-masochist elements that lurk everywhere today. Mind you, if I were Minister of Tourism for Lapland, I'd sue. Just don't watch it before eating. Or after eating, come to that - it's not Little Women!"
Sisu (2022),It is impressive and very original.,"It has a lot of violence, blood and gore. His way of representing the violence and tragedy of the Second World War in Lapland is very realistic. I like that they also represented strong women willing to do whatever it takes to defend their country and their personal integrity. However, we must take into account that it is a mix between Rambo and John Wick, so we must accept certain freedoms that we know are impossible in the real world. Definitely, just because of the landscapes and the script, this is a different film that will entertain all lovers of action and violence. And the ending is spectacular."
Sisu (2022),Tarantino Homage,"Ninety two minutes of great fun and escapism. Stylish story set ups, chaptered for our delectation, no non sense story telling which delivers what it promises. I was surprised it was not a foreign language film which is what I had expected but nevertheless the little dialogue there is does not detract from the films visual feast. I had read some reviews of 1/10 bemoaning the lack of realism or ridiculous storyline which made me smile as the film is and was never intended for that type of viewer. Just sit back and relax and watch a very good blood and thunder rollercoaster rounded off with an excellent one liner James Bond of the 80's would be proud of."
Sisu (2022),"Intense, Wild and Dangerous! The Finnish John Wick","Intense, Wild, and Dangerous! If you like John Wick, you will appreciate Sisu. Gets a 94% like rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Great action adventure flick. Sit back and be entertained. Short synopsis: in the last days of World War II, a solitary prospector crosses paths with Nazis on a scorched-earth retreat in northern Finland. When the soldiers decide to steal his gold, they quickly discover they've met a combat vet with some unique special forces skills. Sisu is a remarkable film that will captivate you with a powerful narrative of determination, strength, and willpower. Again, watch and enjoy."
Sisu (2022),Not,"Bad for what it is , but not very good either .definitely could have been much better . First of all , it feels like a rip off of cult movies made by Uve Ball or Tommy Wirkola and it is fine with me , the problem is , that abovementioned masters of mayhem and gore , make their films in the genre of horror-comedy , that is why they are so fine . This offering is taking itself way too seriously , which makes it unrealistic and outlandish , though entertaining ... Anyhow a decent one time watch , even though , add to action and gore some humor and this film would be another instant cult classic)))"
Sisu (2022),"""Any last words? I didn't think so.""","FILM: 7/10. Kicking off my first watch of the 2023 film Sisu, the premise alone had me intrigued - a Finnish ex-soldier finding gold and tangling with Nazis? Sign me up for that rollercoaster of action! The film wears its influences proudly, with Quentin Tarantino's stylized violence and segmented story structure leaving their mark. But it's the legacy of Rambo that truly shines through. Jorma Tommila's portrayal of Aatami, an ex-Finnish soldier targeted by retreating Nazis, brings a touch of classic action hero ethos to the story. As Aatami faces off against the ruthless Germans, it's no surprise that things don't end well for them. The action unfolds with a delightful flair, featuring original kills that are both inventive and graphic. It's a feast for fans who relish a bit of cinematic carnage. While the film delivers undeniably entertaining action, my main gripe surfaces as Aatami's survivability reaches near superhero levels in the escalating confrontations. This aspect, though thrilling, stretches the bounds of credibility, potentially diminishing some of the earlier impact. Nevertheless, for those seeking a straightforward action film with a unique perspective, Sisu delivers the goods. The film's blend of influences, from Tarantino to the legendary Rambo, results in an action-packed ride that keeps you hooked from start to finish. An entertaining and graphic escapade that offers a fresh take on the genre. FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray VIDEO: 10/10.

Sisu (2022),"Entertaining bloodshed, but too hard to swallow","""Sisu"" is a great example of a movie that does exactly what it says it'll do on the tin. It's a brutal, hyper-violent revenge and survival thriller set in Finland during the end of World War II. The protagonist is a prospector who discovers gold on his property. He takes is to exchange for money, but is accosted by Nazis, who steal the gold and try to kill him. The rest of the movie is really just the protag avoiding death in ingenious ways, while visiting it upon the evil Nazis. People get stabbed through the head, they get blown apart, they have their throats slit. Watching the movie becomes like watching a slasher flick or something from the Final Destination franchise. You're just waiting for the next kill, because scenes don't really build, and you never get much of a sense of character from anybody on screen. Also a lot of the action seems too unrealistic to really take seriously. Note the scene where the protag survives being shot with multiple machineguns at the same time by bouncing the bullets off a hubcap. So it just feels like a litany of violent moments, when it could have been a brutal survival story. It's still pretty entertaining, though."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),FUBAR,"I went into this movie knowing it's good and praised. It was still an amazing watch. One of finest collaboration between Mr. Hanks and Mr. Spielberg, *Saving Private Ryan,* still maintains its glorious status after many years. Its opening scene in Omaha Beach is probably the best war battle sequence of all time and its influence is ubiquitous in many war movies to come afterward. Its depiction of war is not sensationalized and it's almost too realistic. The fear that these soldiers felt can be felt through the screen as well. The next major battle sequence at the bridge was quite amazing too but the first opening scene was quite overwhelming. The story in between the battles is still interesting. The major theme around this movie concerns the morality of forming a search party for one man. To save private Ryan, many lives have been sacrificed. Lives lost vs lives saved is a key theme and just like the members of the search party, the audience can't help but question the morality of it all. It's a flawed mission from the start but also is justified by the unimaginable potential grief of losing all four sons to war. Other aspects of the story of how Captain Miller is a hardened but still anxious English teacher turned into leader on the war field. The story of Upham and his idea of morality during wartime is also something to ponder about. This movie is great because it doesn't depict these guys as heroes and most of them die anyways. They are just regular people caught in fires of war. Watching fine and well-crafted movies like this should all bring anti-war sentiments. There is nothing glorious about war. Although the movie starts and ends with the American flag, it is seen as a nod of respect for those who have perished in war rather than calling for more people on the battlefield. If the latter was the purpose, the Omaha beach scene would have been more glamorized. Chilling movie."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),Heroism,"The idea of giving up your life at home to serve your country was a very common idea back in the 40s during World War II when Hitler was a threat on the global stage. All of the main soldiers get their featured time on this journey to save one man from the war, sending him home after all 4 of his brothers died. Among the questions this film asks is, is one man's life worth the lives of those who give theirs for such an honorable mission. The violence is not held back. The cinematography is rough. The situations the soldiers find themselves in test every aspect of their character. This is a classic war film."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),"A visceral, brutal film","Saving Private Ryan has become something of a landmark film, inspiring many other subsequent films to follow its lead and portraying an unsentimental, absolutely brutal world war 2. I have no doubt this is a good film, but I must find some faults with it. The film is overlong and overly exhausting. One of this films strengths is that its action sequences are so tightly choreographed and well edited that it draws you in easily and you can become easily absorbed by it. The film is hence not exhausting due to technical deficiencies- it becomes slightly too long because its plot does not move much. Neither do their characters grow much. I find Tom Hanks later effort(which he helped produce), Band Of Brothers, to be much better, and perhaps the best media in the genre. Saving Private Ryan lacked the camaraderie, the kinship, and it also lacked the war drama or the insightful observations about war seen in band of brothers. While there is some profound insights in dialogue between characters in the film, it never felt as heartfelt or touching as that in the miniseries. To me, Saving Private Ryan felt too straightforward and empty in its storytelling- there are little to no complications involved in this adventure. Of course, I cannot doubt that this is a landmark film, a film which almost all subsequent war productions earn a debt to. It is bloody, visceral, and devastating in how it portrays the horrors of war. It's action is also so competently done and so enthralling that it has the ability to absorb one in. But it is still a film with a plot that does not earn its 3 hour runtime. It perhaps has too much of a documentary quality to it which dissuaded me from rating it any higher."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),Speilberg's greatest film?,"Maybe Spielberg's strongest film, the casting of Tom Hanks was perfect in his role, the practical effects, gritty feel and lack of CGI all heighten the sense of realism as does the realistic depiction of war as bloody and horrible. All the other members of the team are well written too and we spend time getting to know them during quieter moments at night when our band camp out. The opening beach attack scene with it's lack and score and just the sound of the German machine gun rattling away was and is in my opinion the best filmed war scene I've ever seen. The film as you'd expect with a director this good is also able to explore larger questions and characters are given moments to reflect and learn and grow. The film had a terrific influence on the way future war movies were shot."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),For the ages,"I remember seeing Saving Private Ryan in the cinema ages and ages ago, and some of the youngsters in the audience were making sounds of awe in the opening brutal scene, thinking it was some action-comedy. But Saving Private Ryan is brutal and it shows war as it is. This ain't Dad's Army that's for sure. It's brutal, honest and is unsparring. A lot of Saving Private Ryan fans understandably cannot stand the fact that Shakespeare in Love beat out Spielberg's WW2 homage for the Best Picture Oscar. I can sort of understand why, and I wonder what the voting tally was. But we'll never know unfortunately."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),Beatiful movie!,"An incredibly fun film from start to finish, the beginning of the film is interesting and has a proposal that makes you want to go to the end, the middle of the film has fun and well-made scenes, especially the one with the other Ryan which is super fun; the final battle is busy from start to finish, rewarding the ""boring"" scenes of the film with a lot of dialogue that occur before them, the final fight is very well done and an emotional outcome that makes you almost cry along with Ryan. The direction is spectacular, perhaps the best thing in the film, the first-person views are incredible. The characters are very well done and charismatic, making you even like the secondary ones. Excellent film and highly recommended!"
Saving Private Ryan (1998),GERMAN PILLBOX - NOT INFALLIBLE,"This is my opinion as an American citizen whose family is one of the oldest of America, and whose ancestors fought in the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, and World War II. These are my questions. Why didn't U. S. military leadership assess the beaches of Normandy and eliminate the german pillboxes before the invasion? Why didn't U. S. military leadership decide to bomb the living hell out of the pillboxes? Especially on the morning of the invasion. BOMB THE LIVING HELL OUT OF THE PILLBOXES. The pillbox was designed to withstand bombing, but continued bombing would have helped tremendously. The U. S. Navy ships could have attacked the pillboxes into oblivion, with target being the opening of the pillboxes. Even on the morning of the invasion. At a minimum, send ordnance straight into the pillbox openings. Over and over. The german pillboxes were excellent, BUT....there is always a weakness, and that weakness was the OPENING of the pillbox. The pillboxes allowed the nazi cowards to kill American soldiers like a fish in a barrel. And THOUSANDS of lives were lost that day. My opinion is that U. S. military leadership failed regarding the german pillbox."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),What a War Action Movie Should Look Like!,"This film is directed brilliantly. The actors portray their characters realistically and adequately. The cinematography is brutally good. The story makes sense. The reason I'm not giving Saving Private Ryan (1998) a full 10 is that it's not my favorite movie and at times - very brief moments - the movie came across as overlong. That is. I wouldn't say anything else against it, and I certainly recommend it to any guy or even girl with free time! I'm not a Spielberg fan, but kudos for this film. This is how you make a war action drama - Hollywood, take a cue from your director. Final score: 8/10."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),"Mind blowing, exceptional and attentiveness","In this film, there was a war between the United States and the Germans; during the war, the unit was ordered to go and search for a soldier named Private Ryan (Matt Damon) because all his brothers were killed during the war. The unit was led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), Sergeant Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), and Private Jackson (Barry Pepper). As the film started on the beach it was very realistic and exciting as the soldiers tried to come ashore and clear the beach. Captain Miller and his unit was one of a group of soldiers was a school teacher he didn't know much about the war but he was deterninde to accomplished his directives that was givien to him by the superpoirs. First, I must say this film was terrific, and the editing that took place to make this film must have been very difficult. To have this film be lifelike was tremendous work, with everything occurring during any war. The emotions of this war were great. Also, when one of the men who was in the war was going to the cemetery where his fellow soldiers were buried, it was emotional for him. We could see that on his face as he approached the graves sites of the soldiers who were killed during the war. The scenes change from one to another, like you were in the film as it was being shot. The film will go from one scene or image to another with realistic images that transfer smoothly to include the person with their guts out to someone who had their arm blown off. The fight on the beach was the scene I believed was the most challenging to edit, and it had a smooth transition from scene to scene. The sound effects in this film were very loud and realistic from the start to the end. This was about finding another soldier and bringing him home during a war. During any war, there are bombs, guns, and many other explosives going all through the film, far and near. This film could not have succeeded without the sound effects of all the explosions and gunshots. The sound effects made this film seem to be a war that had taken place."
Saving Private Ryan (1998),The battle scenes are great,"The movie picks up speed with the battle scene and manages to keep the audience glued to the screen. The battle scenes at the beginning and towards the end of the movie were magnificent. The angles of the check and the lifelike narration were fascinating. In my opinion, another movie in which a war scene is depicted so realistically is very rare. I congratulate director Spielberg for his direction. I did not see any scene in the movie that could be criticized, that I could say was wrong here, or was badly done there. The movie was very fluent and enjoyable. When you watch people dying in a war movie (even if it's a movie), your heart breaks. In my opinion, war is one of the worst events in the world. While watching the struggle of these soldiers, whose arms and legs were torn to pieces and thrown around, under the rain of bullets, I thought for a moment that these situations were actually happening, even if I was not a soldier of my own country. How bad and painful the war was. I think the message given in the movie was very meaningful. Is it right to risk the lives of eight soldiers for the sake of one? Finally, I would like to explain that the movie is of very high quality and offers great viewing pleasure while watching it, but it does not leave a great impression. But there is also a fact that I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has not watched this movie yet."
Army of the Dead (2021),Disappointing at every department...,"After being actively bored by the ""Army of thieves"", one would expect that the involvement of a superstar director like Zack Snyder would bring some well deserved quality to this zombie packed sequel. Snyder not only directs and produces, but also does the cinematography and this is the weakest link in a rusted chain of elements of something that looks like one of the worst episodes of ""The walking dead""...
Leaving aside the long, bad dialogues and childish script, this movie has so many useless blurred shots that it makes you wonder if Snyder's ophthalmologist was ever available for him. Unfortunately, cheap means to creat tension don't work and quantity doesn't necessarily means quality...
Just another big budget zombie movie to forget..."
Army of the Dead (2021),Not Much Here,"Despite the reports that this movie wasn't any good, I went into this with an open mind and some moderately high hopes considering how well Zak Snyder had done with his remake of Dawn of the Dead. It's not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead. It's a casino heist movie with zombies, so the best you can call it is sloppy seconds. Las Vegas is overrun by the undead, and Dave Bautista and his assembled team are hired to go into the zombie controlled no man's land to crack a safe and bring back millions before the site gets cauterized with a nuke. Bautista cuts an imposing physical presence on screen but lacks all the attributes that made Arnold Schwarzenegger excel at this sort of thing. They could've gotten more out of Jesse Ventura if they needed a wrestler for this. Considering it's a Vegas bank heist movie, I would have even preferred Sammy Davis Jr. You get some non-standard zombie action in this one too. In addition to the usual mindless meat eaters, there's also a race of intelligent zombies with the zombie king and queen even engaging in some zombie romance. We actually didn't need that. The overall cast was the most depressing thing about this movie. It's got the typical postomodern team of mercenaries, but these people are so lacking in personality that you won't really care what happens to them. The thing is so cliched you already know who's going to make it out and who won't. Honestly, we did this better in the 1940s war movies where the platoon always had a Ward Bond type as the sergeant, Harry Caray as the blond kid and that wise cracking Italian kid from Brooklyn. It's been 75 years since those types of movies, and we still can't improve on those characterizations?"
Army of the Dead (2021),So wildly unoriginal,"It started out decent, but from the second they get to the safe it was almost unwatchable. I honestly would have given it a 7 out of 10 up til that point. Just fun and dumb, acting wasn't horrible, just enjoyable overall up until that point. There were some cheesy moments and lines, but you could look past it for the most part. After the safe though, it was just so dumb I could barely even finish it. There were quite a few things you could see coming from the beginning but I could have dealt with it. After that you could have finished the script on your own if youve ever seen any zombie apocalyptic movie before. The fact that this was 180 minutes long also blow my mind."
Army of the Dead (2021),What the heck did I just watch?,"Well, I watched a Snyder's movie. And I regret it. I understand that every director got his own idea about what a zombie flick should be but this movie is... Damn, it's not bad but it's not good either. Bautista, as the great actor he is, saved most of the movie but alas, not enough to make it a good z movie. First of all: the use of the camera focus shift is overused. It induce a sense of nausea as it constantly shift back and forth as if the viewer is not able to focus the sight. I understand it once in a while but nearly all the scene changes got it, in a way or in another. Second: zombies are supposed to be half-decomposed sacks of flesh and bones poorly held together by clothes. Here, however, they are all nice and solid, fresh out of the gym and even with enough intelligence to create a 'kingdom'. Bub and Dr Logan must be screaming in their graves (for those who understood and appreciate the quote). Absolutely ridiculous and very very unlikely (any zombie movie is unlikely but this one is rooted in the ridiculous). And then, the usual cherry on the cake: I pray and hope that one of these days, directors will learn how an atomic bomb works because so far the depiction of a nuclear strike is hilarious, to say the least and a real turn off for everyone who understand the basic of nuclear weapons. Some special effects are fun to watch but most of them are gratuitous and slapped in the face of the viewer just for the sake of cheap gore. Such disappointment. Such HUGE disappointment."
Army of the Dead (2021),"Movie is solid, don't understand the bad reviews.","I seriously don't understand the hate. This is that kind of movie that is just packed with goodies. Action, story, blood and guts. If you came to see a solid movie you don't regret this is the movie. The movie takes you through hoops and is different. It has its Zack Snyder feel and the actors do very well. I loved the action and zombies were a different take. I guess it all depends on preference. I know I'm late to the this review and I'm sorry. But this seriously is a movie, if back in the day lol, I would buy tickets just to get in line an hour before showtime waiting with anticipation and leave satisfied. Awesome movie."
Army of the Dead (2021),Intelligent zombies and a lot of dumb action,"Zombies should be dumb, slow and ugly. Here at least some of the zombies are intelligent, fast and wearing lingerie. And there is one main nemesis, the boss zombie. Very much like Resident Evil 3, which was the main reason why Resident Evil 2 was the better edition. If you are a zombie movie purist, stay away as far as you can. If you park the fact that it is a zombie movie, it is actually quite entertaining and well made. It is a real Hollywood popcorn movie. There are some parts in it that could have been shortened. Overall worth watching if you don't want to think a lot and just be entertained."
Army of the Dead (2021),This movie is legit,"It's a zombie action movie. Full stop. If you come into it expecting something serious or sophisticated, well... you're an idiot because it's called ""Army Of The Dead."" It's ridiculous, over the top, and in your face. The movie trailers didn't beat around the bush, they showed everyone exactly what this movie is all about, and it 100% delivers on that promise. Zombie tiger? Check. Zombie killing social media influencer? Check. Burger flipping badass? Check. It has all the elements you would expect from a movie titled ""Army Of The Dead."" So turn your brain off, grab some popcorn, and strap in for mayhem, because this is one kicka$$ zombie action flick."
Army of the Dead (2021),Horrible! Waste of time!,"What a waste of time, that's 45 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I know the movie is two and a half hours, but I couldn't take it after 45 minutes and had to turn it off. It makes me wonder how anybody could have approved the production of such a mess. The writing was horrible, the acting was horrible, the special effects were horrible. Am I missing anything? Oh yeah, Hollywood has to preach their worldview religion to us again! If only the writers would spend more time developing a good screenplay, and stop trying to convert us to their worldview. Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk in the opposite way of this movie. A waste of time."
Army of the Dead (2021),Idiotic with bad music,"Interesting premise, idiotic implementation with annoying characters and plot twists as well as bad music choices that just make the whole movie more annoying. Some character decisions are exactly as braindead as literal zombies' and no living human would have thought to make them. If we cut these useless plot twists that won't really add to the storyline, it would also have had a normal run time and wouldn't have bored me halfway so much, it could barely keep my attention through the end. It shouldn't have taken itself so seriously and then it could have been an entertaining B movie. The cinematography is not all bad but being pretty won't save this film."
Army of the Dead (2021),Low-key the worst movie I've ever Watched just a waste of time,"Just a time wasting mess. Poorly made. Just the another Netflix bullshiet. If you've watched the first one it's just a disappointing downgrade but guess what the first movie is not made by Netflix. Save your time and only watch the first one because it's actually good... if we don't count the zombies part. I can't believe how this movie can't even count as zombie movie as well. They are so unbelievably unrealistic compared to other Zombie movies. It's predictable, the daughter character is literally pointless just there to fill up some time and the end doesn't make any sense. I swear when I saw that it's made by Netflix I already knew it. TRASH."
Gone with the Wind (1939),Enduring classic,"""Gone with the Wind"" stands as an enduring classic in cinematic history, and its timeless appeal is owed to its exceptional storytelling, compelling characters, and groundbreaking production. Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film unfolds with sweeping grandeur and meticulous attention to detail. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara is nothing short of iconic. Her performance is a masterclass in acting, navigating Scarlett's complex character arc with grace and depth. Leigh's ability to convey resilience, vulnerability, and determination adds immeasurable richness to the film. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is the perfect foil to Leigh's Scarlett, creating an on-screen chemistry that sizzles with tension and passion. Gable's charismatic performance contributes to the film's enduring romantic allure, making Rhett Butler one of cinema's most memorable characters. The film's production values, particularly its cinematography and set design, were groundbreaking for its time. The sweeping landscapes and grandiose scenes are visually stunning, contributing to the epic scale of the narrative. Max Steiner's iconic musical score further enhances the emotional impact, creating a timeless soundscape that resonates through the ages. ""Gone with the Wind"" is not just a film; it's a cinematic epic that has left an indelible mark on popular culture. Its exploration of love, loss, and resilience, set against the backdrop of a nation in turmoil, continues to captivate audiences. As a cinematic achievement, ""Gone with the Wind"" remains a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring magic of the silver screen."
Gone with the Wind (1939),"""Tomorrow is another day.....""","Epic story from the heart of the South. The casting in particular was spot on here as was the incredible score. The cinematography, lighting, camera work, sets, locations and use of colour also play their part in making this such a memorable film. The film uses the American civil war as a back drop for the character development of a young woman who's beautiful, privileged but ultimately superficial, shallow character and world are shattered by the events of the Civil War and what follows. Unlike most of those around her Scarlett cares little for the cause, annoyed only at how rationing and war have robbed her of all the pretty clothes and men she is used to having around. However she if forced to put on a façade and conceal these aspects of her character. Scarlet has plenty of brains and ambition but again is forced to repress this side of her character too, worrying it will appear unattractive to men. She is not always entirely successful though and little flashes of hot anger appear, especially while talking with her father, a proud plain spoken Irishman who knows her only too well for her to bother trying to conceal anything from him. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes a southern who stands out for his level headedness and thoughtful, patient character, unfortunately for Scarlet he shows little interest in her which only deepens her longing for him, instead he marries his cousin. Temptation lies ahead for Scarlet in the form of the good looking Rhett Butler, a man who in many ways represents the polar opposite of the Ashley, Rhett is rude, direct, cynical and enjoys a joke at Scarlet's expense, for all his faults though Rhett see's through Scarlet with a clarity which few others do. Ashley and Rhett also share a mutual trepidation about the South's prospects of winning the civil war. The first act of the film covers the pulsing mood of optimism and overconfidence which sweeps the south at the start of the war, later to be replaced by grim determination, then finally by desperation as the North closes in around them. Scarlet travels from her childhood home and plantation Tara to the city of Atlanta only to find the union forces are closing in around it. The only way out will lie with accepting help from a man she can't stand. In the second act of the film hard times follow and it is only Scarlet's sheer determination and resourcefulness which save her family and home from ruin. Her shrewd and calculating business mind lead her into accepting another unwise marriage proposal in order to ensure Tara is able to meet it's tax requirements. Many softer characters are unable to cope or adapt to the new life, however Scarlet while suffering is able to meet the challenges ahead and at last put her mind to some practical use, she finds she has a talent for making money. The death of her mother and the premature decline in her father's facilities only push her further into the role of taking charge. Unfortunately the experiences of hunger and fear she suffers leave her mentally scarred and from now on she decides she must be hard and ruthless to ensure her future survival. The third act follows the collision of personalities between her and Rhett Butler, a dangerous scoundrel who finally proposes to her and she accepts. Her wealth and influence increases still further although much of society disapproves of a woman being so business minded and driven. Scarlet's relationship with Rhett is a fiery one, Rhett is mad with jealousy over her unrequited love towards Ashley. The acting is superb, the character development for Scarlet from spoilt child to weary survivor to a final sort of victor is quite something, though Ashley remains frustratingly out of her reach. Some of the scenes are of course now utterly iconic, the wounded soldiers, tomorrow is another day, Franky my dear.... I loved the costumes in this though, the siege of Georgia, Tara before and after. Watching this in high definition really shows off the film in it's full power. It absolutely deserves it's oscars and remains one of the greatest and most influential films of the present."
Gone with the Wind (1939),Ever iconic masterpiece,"Victor Fleming is, indeed, a very revolutionary and great name in Hollywood, and film history. And very much to thank for this great Oscar juggernaut. It is often hailed as one of the all time masterpieces, and it is of course true. It is a vast, long and ever timeless epic, and one of the best films of all time. The actors all do an incredible job, conveying beautiful performances in an epic, heartbreaking and ever nuanced fashion, truly career defining, no faint praise for sure when it comes to such great names. The script spans several decades, and conveys the messages of the wonderful novel splendidly. Being rivaled perhaps only by Citizen Kane in terms of its revolutionary qualities and overall quality. The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, very revolutionary and just breathtaking. The film is an early color feauture, and utilizes it to its full extent in revolutionary ways, as Fleming ever does. Overall, without going on for too long about how much I lovw this film, and how important it is. I will leave it at this being one of my favourite films of all time, to say the least. Every lover of film must watch this incredible feature!"
Gone with the Wind (1939),The definition of epic cinema,"There is so little that can be told about this movie. It is the definition of classic cinema, it's the definition of cinema done right! It was epic,it was crazy,it was excellent. Its plot is so intriguing, it had me fully invested. But the main reason I got so invested were the characters and mostly and first and foremost Scarlett O'Harra. Never have I seen such a well written female protagonist,so human,so real,so determined. So wonderful! Scarlett O'Harra is a female character that today's cinema lacks of,flawed but yet so magnificent! I could not believe I like a movie so old,but they are right when they say old cinema was so good! It's all in the story and the characters, if you succeed in that you can film anything!"
Gone with the Wind (1939),It's probably the greatest movie ever made,"""Gone with the Wind"" is an excellent piece of filmmaking. It is a wildly enjoyable experience. It goes on for nearly four hours without any downtime. It's filled with terrific characters and the cast is just as good. There are excellent performances all over the place. Who delivers the best performance? Take your pick. There are no wrong answers. It's a thrilling, emotion film. It's filled with classic moments. I have seen ""Gone with the Wind"" quite a few times over the years. It gets better every time I watch it. It's probably the greatest movie ever made. (IMDB has a 600 character minimum. So...)"
Gone with the Wind (1939),MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE!!,"I can't believe I haven't given a review for this movie yet..
When I was a little girl in the early 90s, my grandparents would babysit me when mother worked. So naturally I'd watch movies they owned, & ""Gone with the Wind"" was apart of their movie collection. I was like 6 yrs old & I fell in love with it! I wanted to grow up to be just like Scarlett O'Hara/Vivien Leigh! Beautiful, charming, independent, sneaky, emotionally strong, & no matter what she said or done, people still loved her. She knew what she wanted & would do anything to make sure she got it. I wish I had that kind of gumption.. With her charm & beauty she had every man eating out of the palm of her hand! & she even got the unattainable wealthy bachelor to fall in love with her & she didn't even have to put out! She loved her family in her own way. I mean she truly was my idol! I live by the phrase she would say in the movie, ""I won't think about that now, I'll think about it tomorrow!!"" I'm soo happy that Hollywood will never ruin it with a remake. I was a weird child I think because no little kid would love or even watch a movie like this.. & it's the same thing for the movie, ""Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves. I was 4 when it came out & I'd watch it every time I was at my grandparents. That's another movie little kids would never sit through & fall in love with.. I watch Gone with the Wind every Nov. 5th (today) cause Vivien Leigh's bday was Nov. 5th & mine is Nov. 4th! & if I ever have a daughter, I'm naming her Vivien Leigh Rose!"
Gone with the Wind (1939),A Timeless Movie About Love and Being Strong,"""Gone with the Wind"" is a well-known film that takes us back to the time of the Civil War and what happened afterward in the American South. It's based on a book written by Margaret Mitchell in 1936 and was turned into a movie directed by Victor Fleming. The movie is all about love, being strong, and dealing with tough times during a war. Many people have loved this movie for a long time, and it's considered an important part of the history of movies. The main character in the movie is Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh. Scarlett is a determined Southern woman who has to deal with all the troubles of the Civil War and what came after. She's strong-willed, but she can also be ruthless when it comes to protecting her family's plantation, Tara. In the movie, she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable. Rhett is charming, but he can also be cynical. The movie shows how their relationship changes as the story goes on. This movie is famous for its big and impressive scenes, especially in the beginning. It shows the grandeur of Southern plantations and the beauty of the South. The movie's look was groundbreaking for its time because it used a color technology called Technicolor, which made everything look even more vivid. One of the most famous scenes in the history of movies is when Atlanta is burning. This scene shows how much effort went into making this movie. A major theme in ""Gone with the Wind"" is about change. Scarlett's character starts as a self-centered and materialistic young woman but changes as she faces the challenges of the Civil War. She becomes a survivor who can handle anything. Her character represents how the South changed because of the war. This theme meant a lot when the movie was released during the Great Depression, and it still means something to people today. The movie also looks at love in different ways. Scarlett has unrequited love for a man named Ashley Wilkes, and she has a complicated relationship with Rhett Butler. These relationships show that love can be really complicated. Rhett's famous line, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" is one of the most famous lines in movies. It shows how his relationship with Scarlett changes. ""Gone with the Wind"" is also famous for how it shows the American South. It shows the beauty of the South, but it also doesn't hide the terrible parts of the Civil War. However, the movie has been criticized for not showing the history of slavery in the South accurately. It's also criticized for how it shows Black characters, which was a reflection of the time when the movie was made. Even though ""Gone with the Wind"" is loved by many, it's also important to remember that it has problems when it comes to how it shows race and the South. But even with these issues, it's a movie that people still enjoy and talk about."
Gone with the Wind (1939),"phenomenal then, absolutely perfect now.","This is by far one of the best films i have ever watched. Yes, i know the time length can be difficult to commit to, but it is worth every minute. This is one of the few films that have me stuck to my seat and quite frankly, i would've loved for it to go on forever. The character development is wonderful to watch play out, all actors bring their all to the table and even the small details like the setting, design and appearance of actors was just perfect. I have re watched this film once a year and it never fails to impress me. I have forced friends to give it a chance and watch it with me and midway thru they refuse to even get up for a water break cause they're just as amazed as i was watching for the first time. I will never stop recommending this film, it brings so many genres to the table and the story is just phenomenal to witness."
Gone with the Wind (1939),Hasn't Exactly Aged Well,"Let me talk about the parts of Gone With The Wind that have aged well first. This is a bonafide, epic, Hollywood classic, big budget film. The scene where Scarlet O'Hara walks among the wounded confederate soldiers alone is breathtaking. This was decades before CGI so when you realize every one of them had to be extras in costume just for that one dramatic shot, it blows you away. The cinematography is incredible and the acting, for its time, is extremely impressive as well. And there's even a bit of humor woven into the script. Not a lot, but every once in a while you get a scene that makes you smile or chuckle and you know you're watching a well written story that, at its heart, about survival at any cost. Here's what hasn't aged well. 4 hours? Seriously. A 4 hour film? Did people have nothing else to do in the 1930s? I mean, even fast forwarding through the overture, intermission and exit music it's well over 3 and a half hours. Easily an hour longer than it needed to be. But the main thing is the blatant racism. This film glorifies the antebellum south and sugarcoats slavery like it's FOX News (relax, it's a joke). For me, it's difficult to fully enjoy a movie like this knowing it only helped stereotype African Americans as an inferior race and Whites as the pinnacle of civilization, especially when you think about the fact that nothing is as uncivilized as owning another human being. I mean, there's a scene about halfway through the film where the war is over and the white people are forced to pick their own cotton, and they're all standing around complaining about how difficult the work is, and I'm screaming at my TV, ""But you had no problem forcing your slaves to do it you f%&king evil pieces of sh$t!"" And if that scene had been presented with an ounce of irony or even awareness by the filmmaker of hypocrisy I might have appreciated it. But it was not. When you refer to the union army as the ""evil aggressor"" and spend most of the movie lamenting the fact that southern charm and civilization are lost for good, you're coming down on the side of slavery and racism and that part was difficult for me to get passed. Rhett Butler's treatment of Scarlett O'Hara hasn't aged well either. Threatening a woman that you're going to crush her skull to get her to stop thinking about another man, while holding her head in a vice grip, is ugly behavior. If that's the ""civilization"" this movie celebrates than I'm glad I wasn't born a ""southern gentleman."" In the end, I admired Scarlet O'Hara. She's a tough woman and pragmatist. She will do anything to hold onto her plantation and return it to its former glory, even if that means marrying a man she doesn't love. Even in the end, her crocodile tears when Rhett is leaving her fade away when she realizes she can come up with a plan to bring him back because ""tomorrow is a new day."" That's the survival part of this movie that I appreciated and it's the movie's most redeeming quality."
Gone with the Wind (1939),This is a classic,"Gone with the Wind is a classic movie that deserves to be seen by every film lover. It is a sweeping epic that tells the story of the turbulent romance between Scarlett O'Hara, a headstrong Southern belle, and Rhett Butler, a charming rogue, against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction. The movie is based on the best-selling novel by Margaret Mitchell, and it features an outstanding cast, led by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who deliver unforgettable performances. The movie also boasts stunning cinematography, lavish costumes, and a magnificent score by Max Steiner. Gone with the Wind is a movie that transcends time and generations. It is a masterpiece of storytelling, emotion, and spectacle that captures the essence of a historical era and a human drama. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love with its characters. It is a movie that you will never forget. Gone with the Wind is a classic movie that you should watch today."
Casablanca (1942),10/10,"To get it out of the way, I couldn't choose between whether this film was a 9.75 or 10. This is due to the ending not being what I wanted, but I am giving it a 10 because overall, the ending definitely was amazing. Either way, I am not going to argue with people who consider this a masterpiece or as their favorite film, because this film definitely is a masterpiece. Though I do wish Rick and Ilsa had their happy ending with each other, this does remind me that one of the most important things about loves is that the woman is as safe as possible in any situation or circumstance. I have to probably place this in my top 5 favorite films of all time, along with Singin in the Rain, City Lights, It's a Wonderful Life, and Titanic."
Casablanca (1942),A film to treasure.,"An absolute classic of a film, the restoration work done has an amazing end product. Full of memorable lines and iconic images. The film manages to be immensely entertaining and captivating. It's a film of great strengths, you have patriotism as a theme, Rick so Masculine, Ingrid so feminine it's wonderfully cast. The story takes place in Morocco during WWII, the place were introduced to is a complex one, full of hustlers, spies, secrete police, tricksters, refugees and rumours swirling around. There's also a swell of different nationalities, Arabs, French, Americans, Germans, Czechs and Bulgarians. Rick is brilliant character, tough, sardonic, cynical, witty yet it's also suggested to us this might just be his body armour and underneath is a 'rank sentimentalist.' His life changes when an old flame he very much loved back in Paris walks into his bar in one of the most memorable scenes in cinema. As mentioned the film is so quotable, there's too many good lines to even list. The music is also superb in this film and the scene of the French National Anthem being sung might just be the best one in the film. I saw this film for the first time in 4K yesterday and it's just stunning. The level of clarity, depth and detail now in the picture is outstanding, it's like a new film made yesterday almost. It also gives you such a deep appreciation for the cinematography in the film, the use of smoke and shadow and light and contrast, the way light and shadow fall across a characters face, the gleam of their eyes, it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see I think. There's a reason this film is a classic, it's also superbly paced, I don't think there's one wasted scene in the movie, everything works, it's such a well oiled machine in terms of story construction. This is a film to treasure."
Casablanca (1942),A Timeless Romance in a Turbulent Time,"Casablanca, a film wrapped in the warm embrace of nostalgia, deserves its classic status. I would give it a solid 7 out of 10, not for its intricate plot but for being the Humphrey Bogart of movies - charming, a bit mysterious, and undeniably entertaining. Let's talk about the narrative twists. The plot might not stand up to rigorous scrutiny, but then again, Casablanca is more about capturing the essence of a turbulent era than meticulous storytelling. The ""letters of transit"" might sound like a convenient plot device, but they serve their purpose in keeping the tension alive. Choosing Casablanca as a backdrop for a love story amidst political chaos might seem curious, but it adds a layer of complexity to the characters. Renault's questionable ethics reflect the moral ambiguity of the time, even if it doesn't align with modern standards. The supporting cast is a vibrant mix of characters, from the rival nightclub owner Ferrari to the duplicitous police chief Renault, played with finesse by Claude Rains. Dooley Wilson's rendition of 'As Time Goes By' adds emotional depth to the film. Bogart and Bergman share undeniable chemistry, even if their characters are not as fully fleshed out as one might hope. Paul Henreid as Laszlo embodies the spirit of resistance, though his post-US plans remain a mystery. Casablanca, with its rose-tinted glasses and melodramatic crescendos, is a love letter to a bygone era. While it may not be a cerebral masterpiece, it captures the essence of wartime romance and sacrifice. Woody Allen celebrated Bogart's performance in 'Play It Again, Sam,' paying homage to Casablanca. This connection adds another layer of appreciation for a film that continues to enchant audiences with its timeless allure."
Casablanca (1942),The enemy couldn't win.,"Spoilers. Observations. Reflections. Opinions. The enemy couldn't win. You could see this with Le Marseillaise triumphing over that teutonic song entree. You could see the love of freedom, in the audience's eyes. You could see this in a scene where Bogart shoots the bad guy. The words of the French anthem go something like this: Wake up, you citizens. We have the glory. We are strong. We are tough. Man your battle stations. We will water our farm fields with the blood of our enemies. This is why you see the tears in the audience's faces when they sing their anthem against the song of the enemy. This is why you know that they would beat the enemy, and that the good guys would win. You could tell the outcome of the film from this hint. Yes, you could predict the end of this movie. I hate black and white films, but in this one I will change my mind. This one is played against the background of international conflict, and apparently did better in the neutral coloring genre. Besides, in 1939 you had two color blockbusters -- one about the American South and the other one about a fantasy neighborhood way up in the clouds. War is ugly. Black and white fits here. There are no fabulous song and fancy dance motifs here. Of course, my regular favorite films are absolutely full-color song and dance films. Film observations: Bergman clothing sensational. Bogey dressed quite well. You could tell that there were rich people in the casino. No poor people could afford to be there. The letters of transit were the actual stars of this film. The people were just accessories, lol. 10/10."
Casablanca (1942),"Here's looking at you, kid!","Not many times have I gone out of my way to write a review here but this masterpiece certainly makes it worth it. I won't bore you with the details of what goes on the movie, however, I'll tell you what it can do to you. It makes you remember how lucky we are to live in an era where there is no war, at least not a world war that is. It allows you to value your loved one, even more so that you already do. Even if you don't have a special someone at present time, it clearly explains what unconditional love can be. The acting is just wonderfully performed, so is the script. A true work of art that will be regarded for centuries to come as one of the best romantic movies of all times if not THE BEST."
Casablanca (1942),good,"The film unfolds in the titular Moroccan city, a haven for refugees seeking escape from the ravages of war. At the center of the narrative is Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart, a cynical nightclub owner with a mysterious past. When Ilsa Lund, portrayed by Ingrid Bergman, re-enters Rick's life, old wounds are reopened, and the story takes a poignant turn. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is electrifying, and their performances elevate the film to a level of cinematic artistry seldom matched. The iconic line, ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" uttered by Bogart, has become synonymous with classic Hollywood romance."
Casablanca (1942),Ageless classics,"The film ""Casablanca"", which was released back in 1942, is certainly a classic cinematic work that still remains an integral part of American culture. Director Michael Curtis has created a unique atmosphere where the historical context is combined with an intriguing plot. At the center is Rick Blaine, beautifully performed by Humphrey Bogart, who leads a secluded life in the neutral city of Casablanca, located in Morocco during World War II. Acting in the picture is definitely one of the main strengths of this work. Humphrey Bogart perfectly conveys the emotions of his character, capturing his complexity and inner experiences. His laid-back charisma and impeccable playing style create the unique appeal of Rick Blaine. Especially impressive is his interaction with Ilsa Lund, whose image perfectly freezes in the viewer's memory. Thanks to Ingrid Bergman's good acting, Ilse's image turns out to be organic and definitely succeeded for the actress. I still can't understand why this duo didn't take the Oscars for the best male and female roles. Despite my reserved attitude to the picture as a whole, I think that Bogart and Bergman played well and could have become winners. And if the first one received a nomination, then Ingrid was not even awarded such an honor. A pity. The picture will certainly pose a lot of questions to the audience about who and how should have behaved in this story. Where and whose place, how to be, torn between feelings and duty, finally, what will happen after the choice is made, first of all, in the soul of the heroes. The film, directed by Curtis, will allow viewers to decide for themselves what is right and what is not. Despite all the positive aspects, it is worth noting that the picture seemed boring to me. I understand that my expectations played a negative role. I have heard a lot of extremely positive reviews about this film, and when I got to know the picture myself, the film seemed ordinary and not very remarkable. Despite the presence of romantic and dramatic moments, ""Casablanca"" sometimes slows down the pace, which can be explained in the historical context and the nature of the characters. However, this feature can hardly be defined as a disadvantage, since it is part of its unique atmosphere and helps to delve into the specifics of the events and experiences of the characters. But I, probably, as a modern viewer, saw a negative side and a protracted narrative in this. In conclusion, I would like to say that the film is a vivid example of classic Hollywood cinema. The acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman impresses with its strength and emotional depth. But everything else passed as if in the background. However, it is worth noting that ""Casablanca"" was and remains one of the most important works of cinema and undoubtedly deserves recognition and admiration. Let the film look quite simple and even predictable today, the picture will definitely find its audience. After all, this is a classic. 6 out of 10."
Casablanca (1942),"""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""","FILM: 8.5/10. Diving into 1941's Casablanca was like uncovering a hidden treasure chest in the cinematic seas. Much has been said of the film in the past eight decades, and for good reason. Sitting down to watch this classic, I quickly found myself immersed in a bygone era of wartime intrigue and timeless romance, where fedoras were a staple and every shadow held a secret. As the story unfolds, Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick Blaine struck a chord with me-world-weary yet undeniably charismatic. His chemistry with Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund is the stuff of cinematic legend. Their on-screen dynamic balances the desires of their characters perfectly with the realities of war. The supporting cast is a treasure trove of memorable characters. Claude Rains as the charmingly corrupt Captain Renault adds a amusing layer of wit to proceedings, and who could forget Sam's soulful tunes at Rick's Café? The film's dialogue is a masterclass in wit and sophistication, with lines that have etched themselves into the very fabric of movie history. That's even more impressive given that no one involved knew they were making cinematic history. To the screenwriters this was merely one of six films they churned out in 1942. Casablanca may be a love story at first glance, but ultimately it's a tale of morality amongst the backdrop of a harrowing time in the world's history. The setting, a melting pot of conflicting interests and cultures, is perfectly captured in the microcosm of Rick's Café. The theme of sacrifice and that haunting, often repeated melody of ""As Time Goes By"" will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. In a world where flashy CGI often steals the show, Casablanca stands tall as a beacon of well-crafted storytelling. Here's looking at you, Casablanca. FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray VIDEO: 10/10.

Casablanca (1942),Masterclass in Story Telling,"There is no parts of this movie that didn't feel unnecessary or bloated. The meticulous attention to detail is at a level that every film maker can only hope to strive for. Every scene was important to the story, every character had a moment to shine, and every line was well thought out and executed to near perfection. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blain is masterful in his role, allowing all the subtleties in his performance to make a huge impact in his character progression from a cynic to a 'sentimentalist'. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund brought a charisma and innocence to her role that can make just about anyone fall in love with her. Together their performances brought to life one of the greatest love stories in cinema history. I can go on and on about the excellent performances from Paul Henreid and Claude Rains etc., but I would just become a broken record at that point. I urge most people who have yet to see this movie to do themselves a favor and watch it ASAP! It is a must watch for all movie lovers."
Casablanca (1942),Saracasm at it's best,"(19420 Casablanca
WAR DRAMA Sarcastic dialogue in films was used earlier but never quite as effective as this film! If there is ever a film that reinvented how dialogue is spoken in films it would have to start with this one! I also respect how the film allows other actors of other ethnics to use their own actual language or their own foreign accents! Fictional plot starting with the Nazis takeover over France with stubborn bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) mixing it up with old flame Elsie played by Ingrid Bergman unveiling his past! All performances are top notch- though the story could've been heightened at the end."
Dunkirk (2017),Nolan's heart was in the right place at least,"*I know what Nolan was trying to do, make a war film with as little cgi as possible. He wanted everything to be in front of the screen. We have to applaud him. Execution wise, this movie is boring, slow, and even at less than 2 hours it feels 30 minutes too long. *There is no story, no characters, and Dunkirk looks very very bare. Just watch that ""Dunkirk-scene"" from the movie ""Atonement"" and you will see that it is done way better in ""Atonement."" *This movie is just boring but Nolan can't help but add his ""magic"" to it. He just can't make a straight forward film anymore, he has to make different timelines, he has to try to make everything ""Memento-like."" Not everything needs that back and forth thing, just make a straight up story. 5/10
Good directing and acting, but boring film, action scenes are boring, no story, no characters, and Nolan really needed to add come CGI for his Dunkirk films to show more troops. It just looks so bare."
Dunkirk (2017),Nolan's Dunkrik.,"Visually thrilling with amazing performances achieved through minimal dialogue, replaced instead with superb sound design, the scream of the enemy planes in the sky above the evacuating troops in particular stood out. Characters and Structure
Dunkirk stars Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Keneth Branagh, Fionn Whitehead and many others, the main cast is nearly entirely British. The film tells the story firmly from the perspective of those British forces caught up in the disaster, the strafing of beaches and ships for example is filmed purely from the perspective of those under attack looking up at the planes. It never cuts so that we see the German pilots in their planes looking down on their targets nor do we see allied generals and politicians in a war room, spoon feeding the audience information. There are only two characters of seniority that really deliver any exposition about the wider context of what's unfolding and even their dialogue is brief. Nolan's approach during the beach and sea sequences is almost equivalent to a camera gliding along the surface through the events as they happen, this gives it a kind of rawness and realism which a more traditionally structured film couldn't do. The focus here is purely on a handful of characters and their life and death struggles, several times machine gun fires rips out from an unseen enemy, just like our characters we never get a good sense of the other side's perspective. The sequences of boats sinking filmed from inside their interiors for me surpasses Tiatnic (1997) in terms of its nightmarish power. There is an amazing close shot of a ship in the inky black of the night lit up by the red and orange of a fireball bursting out of it's hulk. Harry Styles is sort of our main protagonist, right from the go he is running for his life. Without much dialogue what we learn about him comes mostly through watching his actions and expressions. He seems to be a perfectly ordinary young man caught up in a horror he couldn't have imagined. For all the ear-piercing noise and hellish fighting some of the most profound moments are the still quiet ones of soldiers stoically waiting their turn, characters sat gazing mournfully at the rough sea, perhaps too exhausted to do anything else, hoping tomorrow they will have better luck. It's a film about people just clinging on, quite literally in several sequences. It's lack of dialogue in favour of visually storytelling is on par with Mad Max Fury Road (2015) another Tom Hardy film. War films can tend to fall into two different kinds of structures, there is the Sands of Iwo Jima/The Dambusters/American Snipper/Hacksaw Ridge kind which introduce you to your character/s, then in the 2nd act take you through their training before the 3rd act is the climactic battle you know has been coming. The other approach is to pretty much open and close the film in the middle of the war, Saving Private Ryan being such a film. Unlike a Oliver Stone movie this doesn't seem to be an anti war theme nor is it a jingoistic affair. Its simple matter of fact approach just tells the story. Cinematography and Score
The score I loved and think it really suited this material. Hans Zimmer does an excellent job of combining traditional score with more ambient sound to create a grittier sounding music than you'd otherwise get. The cinematography does a fine job balancing a filmetic look with at times a more documentary style. There wasn't any excessive colour grading that I could see, it all looked nicely balanced and natural. The film's colour pallet is of course made up of lots of sandy yellow, and khaki green, this fits nicely with the greyer colours of the evening with the blue sea and dark interiors of the ships. The tone of the film is sombre, at times desperate and naturally lacking in any humour or levity. The film was shot on location at Dunkirk at uses thousands of extras as well as real aircraft and ships to create it's impressive sequences. In an age which is increasingly going digital Nolan shot this on real film. Other thoughts Soldiers of all nationalities in our media and culture can often be portrayed purely in terms of projecting power, impossibly fierce, fearless killing machines. Dunkirk shows us exposed, vulnerable and sometimes frightened traumatised troops stuck in a dire desperate situation. The effect of this choice is characters feel real, not Hollywoodised movie characters who yell out witty dialogue to eachother between reloading or unstoppable baddass types who charge around implausibly dodging bullets while pumping lead into their enemies. As you'd expect part of the story allows time for the civilian effort to rescue soldiers from Dunkirk. Mark Rylance is given a big part here. In a way the film does make you question whether in 2017 a similar response would follow from people in the UK if lots of other people found themselves needing help. If a sense of shared purpose and unity ever existed or such a thing as a national spirit then it's hard to believe it is just as alive and well today. The film also made me question a bit too whether people today would be hard enough to go through something like this. A delay on the M5 the other day had a woman on the news in hysterics over the fact her dogs in back were very hot. Half the audience at the cinema I'm afraid were overweight, mostly dressed in shorts and t-shirts, munching on their food as they watched the men on the screen struggling in the waves. A man in his 50s at the front of the cinema had even stripped down to his vest by the time the film was over, have we become so unhealthy now that sitting down in spacious cinema for two hours can make a person this hot? In terms of negatives with the film, I don't have many. There's quite a lot of cutting between short sequences which I haven't noticed quite so much in Nolan's other work, it was a times a bit grading. I found a bit of the dialogue from Mark Rylance hard to follow, incidentally he probably has the most lines in the film. It's stated to this man lost his son into the third week of the war, not impossible but I'd be surprised considering 1939 was known as the Phoney War, a period of near total inactivity on the Western front."
Dunkirk (2017),Rating Too High or Too Low,"I will admit my subject title is misleading. However just how in the name of all that is good, can a website that facilitates people who adore cinema, be the arbiter of a 7.8 for Dunkirk (at time of writing) is frightening. 7.8 means its on par with Love Actually!!, I accept to each there own. But what next..... Love Actually is mildly entertaining in parts, but it's no masterpiece, of storytelling and narrative. RT rating at least try's to strikes a balance of those that want to be entertained and those of us that want to be challenged and entertained. Dunkirk is a 9 at least, and it's foolish to suggest otherwise."
Dunkirk (2017),Best movie ever made,This 2017 film Dunkirk was the best war movie I have ever seen as well being a world war 2 us GI reenactor / history buff. The uniforms of the soldier in the movie was very authentic and not farby. I would like to give a shout out on the cast and crew of doing a fantastic job on this film and the research they put into this historical film. The battle of Dunkirk took place in the 40s. The airplanes in the film is phenomenal as well as the boats that are rescuing Allied forces. If you have not seen this yet it is the best movie to watch. It is a Great War drama to watch. I hope all of y'all enjoy.
Dunkirk (2017),Long way HOME.,"From the first seconds of the film, the viewer's attention is inextricably riveted to the screen. War tension, fear, pursuit, shooting. This is not a simple war film, with lots of shots, attacks and shouts of 'Hurray!' No, 'Dunkirk' is a film about the soul, about how war affects the human soul and about what people are capable of when there is no way out. The idea of the plot unfolding from three different angles (land, water, air) is simply amazing and shows us the picture of military operations as broadly and realistically as possible. Thousands of soldiers who are exhausted and dream of only one thing: to return home. Enemy planes targeting ships filled with wounded and water claiming thousands of young lives. Incredible cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema conveys human emotions and genuine anxiety. The body shakes from every explosion, from every shot. Close-ups, long shots - everything looked simply unsurpassed and alive. This film is filled with emotions. There is very little text here, but a lot of action. Every movement of the facial muscles is filled with one or another emotion that simply cannot be conveyed in words. Separately, it is worth noting Hans Zimmer and the mood his music gave to the film. Tension, hope, struggle, luck, anger, loss and victory. It was all amplified hundreds of times thanks to the magic of music. What's really nice is that Nolan, along with famous actors (Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), put young guys at the head of the plot. But the film does not boast of big names, because it is not about individuals. The film tells the story of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and the steadfastness of the people. 'When the soldiers can't go home, the house comes after them' - and it's amazing. Each story told, which ultimately comes together, allows us to feel the tragedy and joy of this historical event. 'Dunkirk' is a quality film that captures the viewer's imagination and once again reminds us that war is evil."
Dunkirk (2017),A War Thriller That Redefines The Genre!,"Christopher Nolan's masterpiece Dunkirk, is one of the greatest war films ever crafted, period. The sheer amount of filmmaking artistry to relive the heart-rending moments of Operation Dynamo & the miracle of deliverance thereafter, deserves momentous praise, with its affecting themes conveyed through technical feats over embellishments. The film then honors the fact based stories, and what an achievement it was. In Dunkirk, the esteemed filmmaker captures the perils of war flawlessly, with tantalizing frames that brims with genuine drama, whether from land, sea or air. These frames showcase the most harrowing moments of the escape from Dunkirk, staged to perfection, that the immense fear, hopelessness & desperation of his characters resounds to its audience, without the need for dialogue & expositions. Nolan as well, veers away from manufactured sentimentality & false heroics, guaranteeing a spectacle whose most compelling feats, are in the filmmaker's chosen details. Nolan's directorial marvel peaks further in the RAF Spitfires & German BF Fighters dogfights, whose insane camerawork ushers exhilarating point of views that renders the action as original and authentic as can be. Apart from the fantastic direction, Dunkirk as well satiates the technical prestige Nolan films are known for. Hans Zimmer's sound design for instance, was impeccable, elevating the spectacles & tension of each riveting plot piece. The cinematography deserves mention as well, with striking images that serves to both dazzle & horrify. The use of practical effects over CGI offers transporting realism, an uncommon treat for war aficionados with a craving for factual representations. Overall, Dunkirk is Nolan's honest-to-goodness tribute that showcases the realities of war, and its psychological consequences. It then redefines the genre that is so used to aesthetically pleasing heroes with personal dramas, emotional arcs, & orchestrated valorous deeds. In its place are the most suspenseful & immersive sequences, unafraid to depict its star studded characters as random & expendable, terrorized by the bleakness of the situation. My sole criticism on Dunkirk, is its unconventional, multiple timeline approach that was needless. Beyond that however, is pure artistry!"
Dunkirk (2017),Astonishingly overrated,"As far as war movies go, this one is on the weak side. There is no reason to get attached to any of the characters because we know nothing about them. The death of the young boy, George, meant nothing to me. He said like 3 sentences before his death, so who cares. Dunkirk is all flash and no substance - It tells an incredibly inaccurate story of the evacuation from Dunkirk and between all the meaningless combat spectacle they still found a way to make this movie pro war-machine propaganda. Extremely flat and predictable performances by the main cast, Tom Hardy in his most wasted role to date, same could be said for Cillian Murphy. The musical score is also just terrible. It drones on and on and on throughout scenes, and overstays it's welcome more than once. Take away the dramatic music, and you're left with nothing in more than a couple of sequences. All in all, a thoroughly disappointing movie."
Dunkirk (2017),A Disappointment Coming From Nolan,"The movie has many major flaws like how there's no character development. Nobody is memorable and nothing really happens during the movie. There is no story nor plot and the only stakes are the other nameless characters die ye hat we have no attachment to. It's entertaining, sure, but when it stacks up to other films from Nolan it's really kind of a disappointment. I feel if they would've fleshed out the characters and had storys and trauma a bit more, it would've had a amazing chance to be up with some of his best works, because in theory Christopher Nolan making a World War II movie sounds amazing but I genuinely cannot tell you any of the characters names and just about nothing happens. I get the movie was trying to go for the message that even surviving in war is difficult, but it was pretty boring except for a few moments that do shine. 5.4/10."
Dunkirk (2017),BORING,"They spend way too much time being on the water or running towards the water with Jaws music in the background and a grey sky up above for there not to be a shark included. This movie could've been GREATLY improved with a lil megladon thrown in the mix. Sound track is pretty rad for a WWII movie. Felt more like Sharknado IV than Saving Private Ryan and the blue tint on everything is literally giving Twilight. The single best part of this movie is when they showed a whale because whales are dope. Whales aren't as dope as sharks, but they're pretty chillasaurous rex. Don't waste your time with this movie. There are no sharks to gander upon."
Dunkirk (2017),Such a underrated movie,So just watch this movie and feeling like i am glad that i watch this movie. Movie scene ending starting overall such a great experience i have feel movie is showing that sirvivial is imp and understand in war is also imp nolan shows this perfectly the way he shoot the scene putting in suspense and many things i like the plot the twist the ending emotional ending the music the cinematography and editing colour grading have best i was watching this in English I don't understand but i feel the movie after understanding the movie i like the way they show overall you should try this movie in a life.
1917 (2019),1917- A well done WWI film,"I feel like 1917 does a good job at showcasing the fighting during World War I. It shows the trenches as well troop morale during the war. I feel like people have more interest in the second world war than the first and there's way more WWII content out there than of WWI. This one is a piece of the WWI content out there I like to see more of. World War I is what the second one is based on and I'm surprised to not see it adapted into film as much as WWII has. I hope that it gets adapted more down the line. Side rant over, time to talk more about this film. It focuses on the British side of the war. It takes place near the end of the war, in the year 1917. There's a lot of action in it, way more action than talking. It's based on the stories told by writer-director Sam Mendez's grandfather, in which some creative liberties taken. Overall, a solid WWI film."
1917 (2019),Totally enjoyable,"Only just seen this film at Christmas 2023, and I cant think of a more enjoyable film I've seen this year. Admittedly there's not a lot of competition at the moment. The main measure for me is, was I completely entertained the whole time? And thats a definitely yes. A simple story really, not great depth, but that didn't matter, I really appreciated the way it was beautifully filmed and edited. The acting whilst fairly simple, was sparse but spot on. I also enjoyed the slower, walking scenes, building tension, adding realism. Yes there are a few times, that, in reality, you know it's not logically correct but it's a film, depicting reality the best it can. It's a film you can watch more than once, just watch it through again only looking at the camera angles and how it was filmed and cut. Just a brilliant stand out film."
1917 (2019),Quentissential WW1 drama,"Many films have, indeed, been made about The Great War, but the master director Sam Mendes' Oscar nominated masterpiece, may indeed be one of the best. It is a very indepth look, featuring a highly emotional, somewhat unconventional and extremely well written and expertly paced script - accompined by some stellar acting, and twists and turns of a life time. The cinematography, cuting and editing is stellar, very unique and very beautifully put together. The film looks very great and is cut in a very realistic and unqiue way. Heavy on metaphors and allegories. Overall, definitely an incredible war drama, ever recommended for any lover of film, and very much deserving of its many awards. One of Mendes' best!"
1917 (2019),An Engrosing Journey Start to Finish,"1917 is a harrowing journey directed by Sam Mendes that follows two British soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) who are given a critical mission of delivering a message to a battalion of soldiers before their imminent advance on the German forces. From start to finish 1917 reinforces the central themes of the futility of war and its complete insouciance for human life. This is achieved by Chapman and MacKay's commendable performances as they convey both the physical and emotional toils that is war. The camaraderie resulting from their critical mission between the lead cast adds a poignant layer to the narrative of the film and reinforces the film's underlying themes of friendship and sacrifice. While Chapman's and MacKay's performances should be noted, the deluge of side characters that the main cast encounters offer exceptional performances. Most notably Andrew Scott's ephemeral but highly diverting performance as Lieutenant Leslie. Andrew Scott embodies the pessimistic indifferent lieutenant so common amongst war films and supports the central theme of the film. As Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield prepare to embark upon their journey, Lieutenant Leslie sows doubt among them by way of sarcasm and prayer knowing quite possibly that the chances that Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield are killed are high. A most notable aspect of 1917 is its tremendous use of its innovative and seamless single-shot technique made possible by cinematographer Roger Deakins. The seamless single-shot technique creates an immersive experience for the audience by having the film unfold in real time. This technique gravitates the audience towards the chaos and urgency that is so prevalent throughout the film. With moments of silence and intense action all in one shot, the technical marvel achieved with the film elevates it to a masterpiece in editing and camera work. Along with the skillful single-shot technique, Thomas Newman -the film's music composer- blends wonderfully with Mendes' production design. Together, 1917 offers a rich atmospheric experience. Whether the main cast finds themselves navigating no man's land in moments of silence or eluding the gunfire and bombings of war, the music offered creates an emotional impact for the viewer and highlights and brutality of conflict throughout the film. Overall, 1917 delivers a cinematic triumph reminiscent of many immersive war films such as Dunkirk (2017) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). 1917 will no doubt leave an indelible mark on the war film genre with its clever use of editing, camera work, and astounding performances while leaving the audience with thought-provoking questions on the futility of war and its brutality."
1917 (2019),Its intimate nature makes a compelling anti-war movie,"It's a narrowly focused war drama that takes place on April 6-7, 1917, in Northern France. It follows two British soldiers on an urgent mission to cancel an attack against the Germans six miles away, which is a trap. General Erinmore (Colin Firth) orders Lance Corporal Thomas Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal William Schofield (George MacKay) to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedick Cumberbatch) canceling a planned attack by the 2nd Battalion on the Germans on the morning of April 7, as he has learned the Germans have set a trap. Thomas Blake is single and unmarried, with an older brother, Joseph (Richard Madden), in the 2nd Battalion. Will Schofield is older and more cynical, having survived the Battle of the Somme in late 1916. ""1917"" follows the two men on their harrowing journey through No Man's Land and German lines in the next 24 hours, and we learn if the mission was successful. The cinematography is brilliant and very striking, as it appears in the film as two long takes for the entire movie. Chapman and MacKay are superb. The ending is beyond belief but probably necessary in most war movies. Fortunately, there are no large battle scenes. We only see three or four actual deaths, but they are very personal. The results of war are graphically portrayed in the scenes from No Man's Land and at one river crossing. The intimate nature of ""1917"" makes it a compelling anti-war movie."
1917 (2019),1917 is a masterpiece!,"This movie stuck with me for so long. It was one of the best cinema experiences that I have ever had. Everything from the cinematography to the performances of the actors (George Mackay is brilliant in this) and from the music to the editing, it is all awe inspiring! The war movie genre has always interested me, but this movie re-defined to me what a war movie is. Instead of focussing on showing the horrors and gore of war, Sam Mendes chose to show us the more human side of war. The story of one man, with all his emotions, and the tremendous task that is at hand. This movie is for me a 10/10."
1917 (2019),The movie that leaves you breathless,"My original thought before watching 1917 was that this movie was going to be a boring, non-combact movie. I never expected to be standing on my feet waiting to see what happens next! The combat in this movie is insane and unlike many war movies out there, 1917 doesn't overload you with it. I would say through that this movie is not for anyone under the age of sixteen due to the fact of the amount of violence there is. Of course that is just my opinion. Another thing I loved about 1917 is the connections you get with the characters. With many movies you don't get that anymore. That is not the case with 1917!"
1917 (2019),I love it!,"The movie 1917 portrays the story of two soldiers who are forced to call off their attack on Germany during World War 1. From a technical standpoint, the film is impressive, featuring a smooth and continuous camera shot that follows the soldiers for 110 minutes. The cinematography is stunning and effectively captures the emotional turmoil of the soldiers and the brutality of war. The movie is immersive and evokes a sense of walking alongside the soldiers. 1917 is incredibly suspenseful, and its intensity can be compared to many horror films. The set and music add to the war scenes and help to create a sense of the historical period. Although the performances of the two lead actors are decent, they could have been more nuanced. Their lack of detailed expressions cost them recognition at major award ceremonies. Although the plot is well-crafted, some of the sub-stories feel empty, and the dialogue in certain parts seems unnecessary. Despite these minor flaws, 1917 is a unique and valuable experience that accurately depicts the horrors of war."
1917 (2019),Cinematic Masterclass!,"I can truly say that this is a film masterpiece and I can also truly say that it's the best war movie I've ever seen. They way that Sam Mendes creates the no-cut type of movie is absolutely astonishing! I absolutely loved everything about this movie, by the stories I've heard and by the photos/videos I've seen I can say that this film is amazingly accurate, it's sad at the right bits, it shows the living conditions of life then and so much more. You can tell by this cinematic masterpiece that WW1 was a wicked and twisted war, filled with ups and downs (mostly downs) I liked how the director showcased how sad loosing a friend through battle really is, he shows us that even though you would really want to stay with your late friend but u cannot because u have a country to serve. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes a good war movie."
1917 (2019),Amazing,Sam Mendes is a genius. He is amazing. Many scenes are extraordinary. Tomas Newman is a great composer but not for this kind of film. If the music was the appropriate this would have been the best war film ever. There are only a few war films I can compare with. All of them had a better score. All had well known actors but in this film acting is very good. Colours are fantastic and scenes all over the film are great with a senses of something different than we saw on other films. Camera is moving very good and clearness of the scenes is something you can notice even from the beginning of the film.
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Rating,"Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie accurately telling the historical story of the crusades and the history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The dialogue fits a confident tone throughout the movie as well as one of greed and anger when the Templars are being shown. The sound design and scenery create a sense of reality. The battles show the desperation of both sides and how chaotic and gruesome medieval warfare was. Although these are definitely pluses, I would have liked to see more involvement with King Baldwin the 4th and how he has defended Jerusalem as well as his relationship with Salahudin. The Queen of Jerusalems story was breaking to see in the end when she fell into a depression instead of pushing through it and making some sort of impact on the kingdom."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),One of the best medieval movies of all time,"This was absolutely an amazing film. The battles where so good and realistic especially the final battle for Jerusalem. I really love the strategic battle and the tension of who will win the battle. I also love the ending of it, it just has something with it that makes it so good. I also love the acting especially Orlando Bloom does great work in this movie. I really love how he plays balian and how his character evolves thru the movie. I also really love the negotiation scene between Saladin and Baldwin. Overall this movie is just great and really does a great job with the battles that take place. 9/10."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),"Impressive, balanced, and 'authentic' epic","Ridley Scott is good at scale, and here he shows just how good. A story about the crusades, Jerusalem, and the deep conflicts of the medieval world could be romanticised one sided and have no historical clarity, but here, real history and authenticity are given a chance, whilst of course mixing in a degree of dramatic licence and wistfulness. In many ways this is often visceral and balanced in its outlook, sweeping and often spectacular, but the film does have its issues; Orlando bloom is underwhelming in the lead, but just about gets by, and I found the dialogue a little unclear at times, but the theme, the dangers of religious fanaticism, are acutely observed, and the crusaders, a confused rabble with equally confused motives, are portrayed accurately, well balanced by a fair portrayal of the opposing Muslim forces. Generally there are no goodies and baddies. It's impressive, and well worth a look."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),It's a sweeping historical epic,"""Kingdom of Heaven"", is a sweeping historical epic that transports audiences to the tumultuous times of the 12th century during the Crusades. With a stellar cast, breathtaking visuals, and a compelling narrative, the film explores religious conflict, honor, and the complexities of leadership. Set against the backdrop of the Holy Land in the late 12th century, the film follows the journey of Balian of Ibelin, played by Orlando Bloom, a blacksmith who rises to prominence as he discovers his noble heritage. As Balian becomes embroiled in the political and religious tensions of the time, he finds himself amid the epic struggle for Jerusalem. One of the film's undeniable strengths lies in its stunning cinematography and production design. Ridley Scott, known for his visual prowess, delivers a visually immersive experience that transports the audience to the dusty landscapes of the Holy Land. The grandeur of the medieval cities, the epic battles, and the detailed costumes all contribute to the film's authentic and captivating atmosphere. The cast's performances are commendable, with Orlando Bloom clearly portraying Balian's transformation from a reluctant hero to a leader torn between conflicting ideals. The supporting cast, including Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Eva Green, and Ghassan Massoud, contribute nuanced performances that add depth to the characters and the narrative. The film does not shy away from addressing the complexities of religious conflict. It explores themes of tolerance, honor, and the consequences of blind fanaticism. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" presents a balanced view of the Crusades, portraying the virtues and flaws of characters on both sides of the conflict. This nuanced approach adds depth to the narrative and elevates the film above a simplistic portrayal of good versus evil. However, some critics argue that the film's ambitious scope leads to a lack of in-depth character development, particularly in the case of Balian. The pacing may also feel uneven sometimes, with certain moments rushing through crucial plot points. Nevertheless, the film's grand scale and thematic depth compensate for these minor shortcomings. In conclusion, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking epic that explores the complexities of religious conflict and the human condition during a turbulent historical period. Ridley Scott's masterful direction, solid performances, and compelling narrative make this film noteworthy in the historical epic genre. Despite some pacing issues and a sprawling history, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a captivating cinematic experience that resonates with spectacle and substance."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Good but nothing special,"This movie is no stunning thing nor anything groundbreaking. It is a fun movie, a really good source of history if you ask me(for it's time). Personally I would think like giving it a 9 if the pacing wasn't so amazingly horrible. It's more like reading a tale than watching a movie. In only 40 minutes of the movie(HUGE SPOILERS ALERT) We see Balian's wife dead, we learn Balian has lost his child too, We see Balian meeting his father whom he hadn't even heard before although a general, Balian kills a priest, Godfrey basically dies and the whole lot of his crew with him aswell, Godfrey completely dies, Balian is annointed king, Balian sails to Jerusalem , Balian's crew and ship is destroyed, Balian loses a horse, Balian finds the horse, Balian kills a great warrior of Syria, Balian travels to the holy lands and Balian meets the king. Now I just spoiled half the movie and all this happened within 40 minutes. It was kind of dissapointing. The acting was amazing especially from Jeremy Irons on a career play, the battles were nicely done. The CGI is pretty much really bad and we see the reason why I personally sat and watched that movie (King Baldwin IV) given really small amount of time. It'sdefinetely worse than many movies of it's kind like Troy, Braveheart, The gladiator etc. But it is not bad honestly. I recommend if you like the Crusadial history or these type of movies."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),"Portrayal of Christianity leaves a lot to be desired - some iconic scenes, beautiful and Leper king is the man","This film could have been better - but it's length, jump around and especially ridiculous portrayal of Christians in the film hurts it. I thought Orlando Bloom acted well, Liam Neeson as a wise mentor is ALWAYS good. The film is shot beautifully, looks amazing and goes for the epic and works. But the star in my eyes is the Leper King (Baldwin IV), his quotes, leadership and courage (and faith) overall is great to watch. Just watch extracts of that on youtube (even though hes not perfect). But I just don't want to watch Christian bashing. The crusades weren't good for either side but Christians were FAR from the only bad guys. Ridley Scott should have done better."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Solid but weired bits,"I saw the directos cut. So basically its a solid movie. The pros: Huge armies, Jerusalem, Medival France,... look is good But there are some things weird:
 orlando bloom is the incarnation of the good Leader. Good looking, well beaved, high morals, always on the rright path... the bad ones are bad, rally bad... black and white, not a lot in between. The character arc is non existent. The only one who get a character arc is orland blooms love interest... she is the most interesting character by far orlando has one facial expression throughout the whole movie lepracy is extremely contagious, people hold the kings hand, kiss his hand, touch his mask... thats silly, it would basically kill them the fight sceenes are not so well choriographed. It is cut cut cut... the romance is really cheese orlando is a genius... he orders that wells are being dug... nobody ever thought of this before! His dad owned that property for years orlando is the only survivor of the ship and a horse... no way where did orlando learn to fight? At the beginning he has no clue and in the end leads the army... why is the father returning back home after 20 years. He does not approach Orland and says hey, I am your dad, I am sorry, I have influence and property and wealth in jerusalem, join me. No. He on his way back to Jerusalem stopps and says can you fix our horses, he apologises but Orlando does not immediately follow him, he turns arround and says ok well good bye... its just weired the second most important leader in the arab army travels alone through the desert and in the middle of nowhere meets Orlando... with 1 Bodyguard with him... sure."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Great one,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a sweeping historical epic that transports viewers to the heart of the Crusades with breathtaking visuals and a compelling narrative. The acting, led by Orlando Bloom, is engaging, as characters grapple with questions of honor and faith. The film editing keeps the story moving at an engaging pace, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in this tumultuous period. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams adds depth and emotion to the epic battles and personal struggles. The film's strength lies in its exploration of the futility of war, the clash of cultures, and the enduring pursuit of peace. While it may have moments of historical inaccuracy and a sprawling narrative, the cinematography captures the grandeur of the medieval world with stunning detail. With an 8/10 rating, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a captivating journey through a tumultuous era, offering both spectacle and substance for those who appreciate epic historical dramas."
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Religion is a powerful toy of politicians,"""What is the value of Jerusalem? ; Nothing"" I think the hidden voice in the film was well heard by everyone; Killing and bloodshed caused by religion
I think the film was a good narrator for the storytelling of this period of time, although it was made from the perspective of the West, but there was still an insistence on sticking to what really happened in it, and there were additional quotes and sub-narratives in the main line of the historical narrative. Were not involved
In history, Saladin has been mentioned in a good way (apart from his religion). What we see in this movie is dignity. Humanity and peaceful coexistence is a priority and is more important than religious differences. (Impossible wish)
The actors of this movie are all excellent, especially David Thewlis, although his dialogues were few, but his acting is always amazing, his voice tone is amazing. This movie is definitely one of the greatest historical-religious movies, if you watch it carefully, it is not difficult to understand the events (the director's cut must be watched) And again: ""What is the value of Jerusalem? ; Nothing"""
Kingdom of Heaven (2005),Another Gladiator-like scenario reboot,"(2005) Kingdom Of Heaven
HISTORICAL FANTASY At the beginning of the film, nothing much happens as the Liam Neeson character as Godfrey de Ibelin, a leader of a small group of ailing crusaders stops by at a random village to stock up before continuing to move on again. But before he leaves, he sees what appears to be his only son Balian (Orlando Bloom) as the village blacksmith and offers him to join them. At first becomes reluctant until he became invoked with rage, killing one of the corrupted monks who stole and wore a necklace once around the neck of his just deceased wife who committed suicide and was supposed to be buried. After running away and eventually catching up with his father, his father becomes gravely injured when a sneak attack came in full circle when the village army were coming to retrieve Balian to stand trial for the murder of one of the so-called monks. The Liam Neeson character eventually dies but as a last resort knights his only son to take his place leaving and telling him that he has ownership of some land somewhere in Jerusalem and wants him to go there. This is where the real the movie starts and I become more tired just watching it! Ridley Scott whose last successful film was ""Gladiator"" solidifying actor Russell Crowe on the map was attempting to redo what he did for him to doing the same type of movie again but with Orlando Bloom is slow, boring and predictable. This film has been done already and it's called ""Gladiator"" why not make something different this time and that's why the film didn't perform well because it's the exact film but with a different setting, using different actors. To pin point the turning point why ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" is similar to ""Gladiator"" is that, although both characters could've chose the path to become great leaders in an uncorrupted and civilized way, they ended up turning it down, allowing the villains or the corrupted to take over resulting to thousands of undeserving needlessly deaths kind of make me hate the main protagonist even more."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Sometimes less is more,"I have read the original source novel (which many of the critics seemed not to) and seen the original 1930 film and upon reflecting on my thoughts once the film had finished, I kind of wish I hadn't. Both the source novel and the original film convey the ultimate sense that war is futile, on all sides and its widely viewed as the ultimate ant-war story. Where those sources excel is the unwavering simplicity of it all. The book focuses on the troops from the German infantry side but also on how troops were viewed back in Germany both before they went, during and when they came back. It is simple in its narrative but that by no means takes away the message it so skilfully conveys. Where this adaptation excels, is the unsettling no holds barred approach. Unsettling score, bloody close ups, clarity of how futile it all is, and the palpable sense of unfairness for a whole generation. It's not perfect though. For me, the last 40 minutes or so, whilst we'll made, tell us nothing. Veering away from the source text, what we actually get here is a message that has been conveyed many times in war before (that the powers in charge have no sympathy for their men) and it feels like it is trying to say more than it actually does. I think whilst this is good, the source novel and original form are perfect. This is not."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),A Stark and Poignant Adaptation: Netflix's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' Captures the Futility of War,"Netflix's 2022 adaptation of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a remarkable cinematic achievement that profoundly conveys the essence of Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel. The film is a harrowing depiction of the senselessness and inhumanity of war, brilliantly capturing the core message of the source material. The film excels in illustrating the sheer absurdity and contradiction inherent in war. It portrays the experiences of young soldiers propelled into the chaos of conflict by ambitions they don't fully comprehend and a sense of duty that becomes increasingly meaningless. The narrative powerfully conveys the idea that war is like an unfathomable fever, illogical yet somehow inevitable. One of the film's most striking aspects is its ability to communicate the horror and utter irrationality of war. It's a poignant exploration of the senselessness of conflict, particularly resonant in the current global climate. The film doesn't just tell a story of war; it immerses the viewer in the visceral reality of the front lines, making the horror and futility felt in a deeply personal way. The adaptation is timely, serving as a stark reminder of the ongoing relevance of Remarque's message. The film's portrayal of the last hours of the war is particularly impactful, showing soldiers being led to slaughter even as the end of the conflict nears. It's a powerful commentary on the ongoing human cost of war, irrespective of its causes or conclusions. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a film that does more than depict historical events; it questions and challenges the very nature of war. It's a necessary and haunting reminder of war's devastating impact on the human spirit and the absurdity of conflict as a means of resolving disputes. This adaptation is a must-watch for its honest, brutal, and unflinching portrayal of one of humanity's greatest follies."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Only the dead have seen the end of war,"This film stands as a testament to the harrowing realities of war, transcending mere storytelling to offer a poignant portrayal of the complexities inherent in the human condition amidst conflict. At its core, the film (guided by an accomplished director) masterfully depicts the camaraderie, love, hatred, hubris, egotism, and the sheer stupidity that characterize the theater of war. The camaraderie shared among soldiers in the trenches emerges as a central theme, providing a glimmer of humanity in the darkest of circumstances. The film vividly captures the deep bonds formed between soldiers, bound by a shared struggle and an understanding born of facing death together. Their solidarity becomes a lifeline, offering solace and support in the face of unimaginable horrors. Through the camaraderie, the film showcases the resilience of the human spirit amidst the turmoil of war, highlighting the strength found in unity. Love, in its various forms, also finds its place amid the desolation of battle. The longing for normalcy and the enduring power of connections to loved ones left behind. These glimpses of love serve as a reminder of the profound loss experienced by those thrust into the maelstrom of conflict. Hatred, both for the enemy and the war itself, permeates the narrative. The dehumanization of the enemy becomes a necessary coping mechanism. The internal conflict, torn between duty and revulsion for the senseless bloodshed, exposes the moral ambiguity inherent in warfare. Hubris and egotism, prevalent not only among commanding officers but also within the ranks, underscore the folly and absurdity of war. The disillusionment experienced by the soldiers, witnessing the callousness and incompetence of their leaders, breeds a profound sense of cynicism. The film skillfully portrays the absurdity of commands issued from afar, divorced from the grim realities faced by those on the front lines, highlighting the tragic consequences of unchecked arrogance and ignorance. Moreover, the film does not shy away from depicting the sheer stupidity and futility of war. The juxtaposition of the idealistic fervor that initially drives the young soldiers to enlist with the grim reality they face on the battlefield lays bare the tragic irony of conflict. The systematic destruction of a generation's hopes and dreams through the brutal machinery of war serves as a scathing indictment of the folly of human aggression. All Quiet on the Western Front transcends a mere anti-war narrative but is a timeless commentary on the human condition itself. Its unflinching depiction of the horrors of war, coupled with the exploration of profound themes and the senseless nature of conflict, make our reality true."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Incredible,"One of the most incredible war stories on film, especially of World War I. It is visceral and intense. It is bloody and full of war horrors. If you want a real depiction of what war is like, and what it does to men in battle, this is a great example of that. World War I was exceptionally bloody based on the style of warfare and the means used to kill the enemy. This is from the German viewpoint. But equally, it shows the human cost. It shows the Germans, like everyone else that was in that theater, our regular people trying to survive from one minute to the next that is often a commonality amongst warriors. This does not get into the history behind the war, and why it started And so forth. This is a human, in the mud, ground level, experience. Nothing to do with generals, making grand decisions, except for a few moments here. It focuses on ground level troops in the infantry, where all the blood and guts are real. Just remake his right up there with the best of all war films."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Very raw and powerful if somewhat heavy handed war film,"A film of young men's dreams and illusions of glory and victory horribly crushed. The film opens in freezing woodland with some foxes in their den, the cameras pans down from above the forest and we see it full of dead soldiers while gunfire rings out and the camera glides across the warzone. The film's battle sequences are expertly shot with all the smoke and cloud and rubble and shells landing around the characters. The film is largely told in one large flashback beginning in 1917 with several young friends eagerly joining the army full of high moral. I'm a bit surprised they were in such a state in 1917, 1914 yes but anyway. The production design is great in this film, the streets, the props, the costumes, you don't for a second question any of it. We also experience the battlefields, the ruined villages, the soaking trenches, the music is also brilliant with this hard industrial clanging sound to it as the soldiers march towards the front line. The film is extremely well acted, I saw it in it's original German language and I thought it was really well cast. As well as the experience of the soldiers we also follow a character in 1918 on a mission to bring the war to the end, his role is to negotiate an armistice and has just 3 days to agree to the French terms. The film lets us know this man is fully aware that the lives of all the soldiers still left in the Germany army may rest on his ability to negotiate a surrender. The film does a good job though at hinting at the power struggle taking place within Germany, the Kaiser and the army have effectively be running the country since the war began, and the army leadership is in no mood to compromise, a particularly callous and mad general seems to believe that just one more successful German attack will lead to a breakthrough and the end of the allied advance, even as his army collapses around him he orders more units to the front. The film gets great little details right too like the thinness of the men who are fighting by the end, the mud they often end up caked in when crawling through the trenches, the longing for good food and the thoughts of women and home dominate the lives of these men who are engaged in a fight to the death now. Not all details are perfect though, German soldiers didn't have to run into farms to steal food and then leg it before they were shot, German soldiers were expected and even encouraged to loot French farms and towns which fell under their control and the French were powerless to stop them. The details are horrific, the dead soldiers and horses littering the landscape, men are reduced to almost animal like instincts, thinking only of killing and eating. The wounded engage in a desperate struggle to survive, men carry comrades for miles only for them to die within minutes of safety, again and again we are reminded how futile it all is, some characters are killed unexpectedly, it's all some random. The film is very heavy handed in contrasting the filth and agony the lowly soldiers live with against the command HQ where the general staff live in luxury and comfort. We even get a scene of the general assured that a factory making riddle saddles will have a long and productive future. The not so subtle point is he's a man now with ideas about 50 years out of date. The truth though is both sides did their best to embrace new technology and innovations, no one solution could have ensured a quick victory and a low number of casualties once these mighty great industrial powers were engaged in all out war across such a vast front. The German general worked night and day for 4 years during the war with the weight of the country resting on his shoulders, when his son died in the fighting it broke him, nobody was spared the pain of the war, despite what this film tries to suggest. In this though the mad commander yet again orders his men to the front for one final attack despite everyone knowing it's madness. But then war is madness I suppose is its message. I do recommend this film as one of the best WWI films out there in terms of recreating the combat experience, this is a world without women or comfort or even humanity for these men, all that matters is the killing goes on."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Best anti war movie,This movie is overall a very good movie with good story telling and good cinematography while also showing the brutality of war which not a lot of movies show while the movie is a bit disturbing some times it has some moments which are very sad also it hold up pretty good for being a war movie though it can be a little bit unrealistic at times it has most of what a movie needs simply because the people who made the movie they knew what they were doing to make an anti war movie (also if you want to know what an anti war movie is it's basically where it show that war is bad and the lives lost are meaningless.
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),Great movie but also very sad,I very much enjoyed the movie it's a great film I love how each important scene is packed full of action it's also a very gory one but not to gory which makes it feel some what real and us the people watching it makes like we were really there in 1914-1918 but the ending is very sad and I was shocked at what happened and it really made me think about how horrible that war was and how tons of peoples friends died and they had to be there to see it. Other than that 10/10 I would watch again for definite and I will recommend it to other people for them to watch this film and enjoy it as much as it did.
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),The horrors both sides faced in WW1,"All Quiet on the Western Front is a great movie. The movie is the story of a german soldier in WW1 and how difficult it was even for the central powers. I only watched the new one but I have planned on watching the old one also. It is German so you will need subtitles if you speak English and don't know german. The story is really moving and at one point it actually almost made me cry. The sadness the main character felt when slowly his friends started to die is really touching and I started to feel it also. I know there are some people that say the older one is better, but I think that if I watch the old one now, I will still think the new one is better. When I watched this, I started to emphasize the German side also. It is a side of both World wars that you never see but WW1 was a different ballgame. WW1 was a horrific war with millions dying just because they stood up in a trench. But in every story we only hear about the British, French, and American point of view. This movie does a really good job at showing that the Germans and their allies also faced the horrors of the trenches."
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),All quiet on the western front review,"Personally for me this movie is a well deserved 10 star because of how great this movie was, it had a great plot, good start, good ending, good acting, and good characters. This is the best war movie that i have watched out of all of the ones i saw, it had really close calls and really panicky and tough situations and made you feel at danger and had you really paying attention and the timing for everything was perfect they pulled it off as best as they could, and you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into this movie because they pulled off every scene perfectly and not sloppy. This movie was also very tragic because the main character had to see things that he wouldnt be able to recover from. Honestly this movie was a well deserved 10 star because of how everything just came together perfectly and the movie shocked you more and more even when you thought you saw enough. In all i could say that this movie was magnificent and well deserved 10 star no complaints, its a must watch!"
All Quiet on the Western Front (2022),"when people call war hell, you'd better believe them","I've never read Erich Maria Remarque's book, although I've previously seen Lewis Milestone's Academy Award-winning 1930 adaptation starring Lew Ayres. Now I've seen Edward Berger's Academy Award-winning ""Im Westen nichts Neues"" (""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in English). Talk about a gut punch. This movie lays bare the saying ""war is hell"", making clear the futility of war (never mind that the Versailles Negotiations set the stage for World War II). One can see a contrast between the horrors of the battlefield and the generals' comfortable residences. This movie - or the 1930 version - could easily be a double-viewing with Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". All in all, everyone should see this. With all the wars that have dominated the 21st century, movies like this one become all the more important."
Wind River (2017),"It doesn't matter who it's to, only who it's from","A compelling murder mystery set in and around Wind River, the Wyoming Indian reservation, a place so awful to live in that one character says that now that she has put it behind her, you couldn't drag her back there with a rope - and she has family still living there that she loves. I guess at this point Jeremy Renner has it in his contract that he has to shoot a living thing in every role, preferably with a sniper rifle? I mean, I'm not complaining; it's just an observation. There is an aging Western anti-hero quality to him; he doesn't necessarily follow the rules, an archetype that has been popular in America for over half a century. There's a very distinct tension(and I'm not just talking about the scenes of confrontations and danger) between the Native Americans and the whites(who make up the protagonists despite this not being their story, in a real world and avoidable ironic twist), especially those who are government, of the awful things that the latter have done to the former for hundreds of years, it fills the air. The acting is excellent, the cinematography and editing really capture the intense cold and harsh weather. I won't spoil the ending, I'll just say that it is a thing to behold. I recommend this to everyone who cares about the long-term effects of colonization. 8/10."
Wind River (2017),It's okay...,"You can take Jeremy Renner out of Avengers but you can't take Avengers out of Jeremy Renner. His character is the strong silent type, he knows everything and speaks in cliches , he can track any man down and is seemingly more suited to investigate crime than the local police or FBI. Why are they even in the movie? This case is peanuts for the great hunter Cory Lambert. Let him to his thing. Elizabeth Olsen could be replaced by pretty much any female actor and the result would be same or even better. Do we have a shortage of talented women better suited for these kinds of roles? I don't know. The results of the investigation were disappointing. We find out that the girl was killed by some low IQ contractors who were so bad at doing crime that they just couldn't be bothered to cover anything up and couldn't keep their act together for two minutes after being approached by the police so they decided to just kill everyone so Cory could rush in at the last moment and be the hero that we need and deserve. Don't get me wrong , I'm not against this cheesy vigilante hero stuff, but it left me wanting more. It's very mediocre movie in basically all aspects."
Wind River (2017),"""WIND RIVER"" REVIEW","Directed and written by Taylor Sheridan. A runtime of one hour and forty-seven minutes. Streaming on Netflix with an R rating. ""Cory"" played by Jeremy Renner is a wildlife officer. Set in Wyoming he hunts predators and keeps things regulated in that regard. It's a very hard life in Wyoming. Very cold and quiet. He lives off the Native American reservation there. ""Cory"" had a Native American wife in ""Wilma"" played by Julia Jones. Along with an older daughter ""Emily"" and a son named ""Casey"" played by Teo Briones. There was a tragic event that happened to their daughter causing her to die. Now three years later ""Emily"" best friend ""Natalie"" played by Kelsey Asbille is found murdered. A neighboring state FBI agent ""Jane Banner"" played by Elizabeth Olsen is sent to investigate this murder. It doesn't take long before ""Jane"" realizes she's out of her depth. She enlist the help of the Reservation Officer ""Ben"" played by Graham Greene to help her. As well as ""Cory"" who feels obligated to help. Since this hits a little too close to home. Poking at old wounds. They will all try to get some justice for this slain young Native American woman. ""Wind River"" was a great film. When the film first came out I always wanted to see it. I just never got around to seeing it. Looking for something to watch I'm glad I stumbled on this. I also thought it was humorous they had ""The Punisher""(Jon Bernthal), ""The Scarlet Witch""(Elizabeth Olsen), and ""Hawkeye""(Jeremy Renner) all in the same film. A little mini Marvel mashup. It did remind me of a film I just recently saw, ""The Silencing"" but done better. It was a fiction film but with very real elements in it. It also lets you know some pivotal information at the end. What Native Americans have been through in America and continue to go through is devastating. They don't even track the countless missing women that go missing every year. A powerful film. That was just the right amount of time. Taylor Sheridan wrote and directed an excellent film. There was one part script wise I felt left hanging a little but I can't complain because it felt like they went well out of their way to make sure everyone was satisfied in the end. This film has some raw and climatic scenes in it I tell you. Jon Bernthal plays ""messy"" so well. He's a phenomenal actor. Not to say he dives deep into his acting bag in this film. I just always liked his acting style. If he's in the film you know more times than not it's going to be a wild mess. Great film with a powerful message sprinkled in between it. Elizabeth and Jeremy have a great connection. Which is no shocker there. They are used to working with one another and it shows on screen. I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. #CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Wind River (2017),Awesome cast and filming,"This should be made into a series! Taylor Sheridan could highlight native Americans! Would be an amazing topic and sur he would make is with style and grace! And Jeremy Renner would rock a lead role! The way this was written, filmed and the male roles portrayed is epic! We need more movies and series with strong males and women of passion as well. And the scenery was beyond beautiful, peaceful, and so exspanive! No one films like Taylor Sheridan! Hope this film brings more native woman to our attention and more of them back home to their loved ones! This movie will stand the rest of time! Thanks to everyone involved!"
Wind River (2017),Taylor Sheridan's Best Work!,I find it sad that Wind River flew well under the radar and did not get the praise/publicity that it deserved. This film features a very strong cast with an engaging storyline/Script. Make no mistake this film can be very brutal because of the content that is shown here but it's such an important story to show to the masses. I was aware going in that Indigenous women in the USA go missing everyday and they do not get the alerts/awareness that other races would get. That's why this film is based off of actual events because this kind of thing happens more then you think. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen give terrific performances here and show a lot of chemistry on screen. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one. Put it on your must watch list! Wind River gets a perfect score of 10 stars out of 10 from me.
Wind River (2017),"Stunningly perfectb quiet, tense, authentic","Found this recently (late 2023), and I'm surprised this didn't have wider exposure. It's a VERY rare example of every element of a film being perfect throughout. There is no sense of acting, dialogue or directing intruding into the experience of being with these characters in this beautiful place, in this bleak circumstance. This a masterpiece from Taylor Sheridan. It's hard to imagine how every actor performs flawlessly, irrespective of his or her role. The visual compositions perfectly fit the narrative - nothing jarring or contrived, or out of step with the story - nothing there just to be noticed. Wind River keeps giving with every viewing. The acting and writing continue to deliver details and nuance that impress more deeply every time. This film is a treasure. Taylor Sheridan is a treasure who is not yet fully appreciated, and,we hope, not yet having reached his peak. We look forward to what he continues to offer."
Wind River (2017),"""You Survive Or You Surrender""","Before there was the series ""Yellowstone"", there was ""Wind River"", written and directed by Taylor Sheridan and set in the same geographic area. Jeremy Renner is Cory Lambert, an employee of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He's a hunter, really, who gets paid to cull the herds and help maintain the balance between the wildness of nature and the domesticity of human life. When an FBI agent comes to investigate the death of a young Native American woman, the agent turns to Lambert for assistance, because she is out of her element. Agent Jane Banner is played by Elizabeth Olsen. The film is filled with accomplished actors. In this gritty police procedural, director Sheridan uses all their talents to create a tense and compelling drama that is rooted in events which actually happened. This means there will probably not be a sequel, but Lambert is a character worth seeing again. I imagine another story, years later, where Banner calls Lambert in on a homicide set in Las Vegas, because she needs ""a hunter"". Oh well, this one-off will do."
Wind River (2017),Familiar Tropes with Insightful Ways of Adding Beauty and Depth,"A multitude of stories told without losing focus, all in a gorgeous setting where an immersive atmosphere is created through a fine combination of writing, cinematography and good performances. There is no grand surprise or innovation, but the all around good film-making keeps the attention perfectly for the full duration. It earns the capacity to create lasting impressions through small bits of dialogue or short scenes that don't stick out at the time of experiencing them for the first time. A bit more memorable score could have pushed this movie a bit further to become a true gem. A strange and wonderful thing that this movie got made in 2017 from 11 million dollars with 2 high-profile actors from the MCU. A good crime, drama with no fat or unnecessary bells and whistles."
Wind River (2017),So I helped solve an horrific crime...,"And all I got you was this stuffed shark and a magazine. A magazine wondering what a woman should look for in a man. And the women of the world wept! Well thank god that after brutal rape (interesting autocorrect doesn't like THAT word), a man is there to reconcile the woman who solved the entire thing. A truly misguided attempt to show a woman's plight, buy people who will never actually understand that threat. The scenery was truly breathtaking. But the most breathtaking thing to me is that this is still acceptable. I would never allow my niece to watch this, except as an example of how we move forward."
Wind River (2017),Oh.. so slow and so average,"What's with all the good reviews? This is at best an average crime thriller with zero suspense and no surprises. Jeremy Renner does his usual quiet tough ""lone wolf"" guy character on autopilot while Elisabeth Olsen as an FBI agent is far too young for her character to be taken seriously. Many people seem to admire the cold landscape, but for me it felt dull and boring. I also wonder why native Americans are always portrayed as drug addicted losers? Like ""Look what the white man did to those poor souls"". The dialogues are dull, wooden and predictable. After 2/3 of the movie the whole conspiracy is also revealed and from there it's pretty much game over."
Django Unchained (2012),Wonderful Tarantino western,"Tarantino has always payed homage to classic cult films and spagetthi westerns throughout his ever impressive career, so it was only a matter of time until he mae a full fledged western - and does so to exception. This is indeed one of his more acclaimed and better films, attested to by its numerous awards, and spot on IMDb's prestigious Top 250 list. It has a lot going for it, and surely delivers as a great masterpiece. It fully embraces its genre gracefully, whilst adding its own unique Tarantino flair of dark comedy and satire across the adventure feeling. All of it splendidly conveyed, wondeful acting from everyone of the legendary cast, and incredible, unique cinematography. Overall, definitely a highlight of Tarantino's, and very much one of his best films. One that is ever recommended, but I would expect most have seen it already!"
Django Unchained (2012),Style but not so much substance,"This is one wild film. It's long, it's all over the place in terms of it's tone, the editing can be rapid and the dialogue comes sharp and fast. We don't really know much about our two protagonists but that's often the way with a western. It's a violent film, in which the violence mostly means very little, a death happens, often for comedic effect, the next scene all is forgotten. You also know throughout the film it's all building up to a bloodbath, that's the way his films work. It's also a revenge movie though it's hard to feel engaged given the way it's executed. The characters are very much that, characters not real people. It also is sort of tongue in cheek making fun of the old spaghetti western genera of movie, everything is all a bit over the top. All the main characters are impossibly charismatic, clever, witty, perfect gunmen etc. The villain played by Leo Di Caprio of all of people is pretty diabolical, a sadistic slaver owner who makes his slaves wrestle to the death for his entertainment and is obsessed with French culture. Despite being set in 19th century America characters appear to wear sunglasses and hip hop music often blazes over action scenes. The first 40 minutes is pretty plotless but the story does then improve, a period of real tension is sustained. Our two heroes must go undercover to rescue Jamie Lee Fox's wife but he must of course conceal his emotion and outrage when seeing her mistreated. It reaches fever pitch when Leo's character given some new knowledge begins to grow suspicious. Can our heroes keep their cool and pull off their heist? Samuel Jackson also plays a very different character to his usual kind in movies, I liked him in this. Things do get pretty far fetched at the end, it suddenly turns into Rambo, our hero can take on dozens of men without taking a single hit. It's also made worse by the director suddenly showing up to play an Australian character which doesn't go well. Many of the characters are undone by their own stupidity, greed and violence."
Django Unchained (2012),Tarantino's Unapologetic Masterpiece,"""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Tarantino at the height of his filmmaking prowess, delivering a bold, brutal, and unapologetic masterpiece that redefines the Western genre. Set against the backdrop of slavery in the pre-Civil War United States, the film follows the journey of Django (Jamie Foxx), a freed slave turned bounty hunter, as he seeks to rescue his wife from a sadistic plantation owner. Tarantino's signature style is on full display, seamlessly blending gritty realism with moments of dark humor. The film's dialogue is sharp and memorable, creating characters that are both larger than life and deeply human. Christoph Waltz, as the charismatic Dr. King Schultz, provides a standout performance that earned him a well-deserved Academy Award. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Django is both powerful and nuanced, transforming the character from a man seeking revenge into a symbol of empowerment and resistance. The chemistry between Foxx and Waltz forms the heart of the narrative, as their unlikely partnership navigates the treacherous landscape of the pre-Civil War South. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a chilling performance as the sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie. DiCaprio's commitment to the role adds a layer of menace to the character, making him one of the most memorable villains in recent cinematic history. The supporting cast, including Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson, further elevates the film with their compelling performances. The film's cinematography, under the lens of Robert Richardson, is visually stunning. The wide shots of the Southern landscapes and the intense close-ups during moments of tension contribute to the film's immersive experience. Tarantino's use of an eclectic soundtrack, blending contemporary music with the period setting, adds a unique and dynamic layer to the storytelling. ""Django Unchained"" is more than a revenge tale; it's a social commentary on the horrors of slavery and the resilience of the human spirit. Tarantino doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of the era, and the film serves as a cathartic exploration of justice and retribution. In conclusion, ""Django Unchained"" is a cinematic triumph that combines Tarantino's trademark style with a powerful narrative and exceptional performances. It's a visceral and thought-provoking experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. If you're a fan of Tarantino's work or simply appreciate bold storytelling, ""Django Unchained"" is a must-watch."
Django Unchained (2012),Quentin Tarantino Never Disappoints,"The title of this review is a fact that it would be foolish for anyone to try to dispute. Just as in Mr. Tarantino's other films, the amount of gore, comedy and funny dialogue is not deficient! The actors once again portray their characters perfectly and in an original way. Leonardo DiCaprio is super funny and Jaime Foxx and Christoph Waltz do not disappoint in the least! Super cool. Oh wow, wait to see Samuel Jackson's character. You'll die laughing. There is a certain amount of drama that I felt in the film, not so typical for a Quentin Tarantino film, but in a very subtle and professional way it was well incorporated into the story and felt realistic. Although the word ""realistic"" is in complete contrast when talking about a Tarantino film :D No, no, super funny, witty and captivating, certainly one of this director's best films and certainly something you've never seen! Final score: 9/10."
Django Unchained (2012),An amazing movie,Django Unchained is an amazing movie and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is not a single scene I do not like and even some parts of this mostly serious movie were even funny. Any scene Django was in was amazing and this was a very action packed film. I also enjoyed his partner Dr King Schultz and he was one of my favorite characters throughout the movie. I also liked how Django was doing all of this in the end for the girl he loved and would not stop till he got to her. I liked when Dr King Schultz looked back at Calvin Candie and walked up and shot him just because he wanted to. Then after that happened Django had a big fight. It was him going against everybody and he took out as many as he could before they threatened to do something to the girl he loved. This was one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen. All of these are reasons why I think this is one of the greatest movies ever.
Django Unchained (2012),Incredibly violent awesome western ride,"Graphic violence and lots of blood and gore, kind of like Sergio Leone on steroids, as a unique pair of bounty hunters travel about collecting bounties in a very ingenious way and take a lot of chances as they navigate the old west looking for Django's lost wife. Lots of fun humor and action. No questionable content, some nudity, a bit intense for younger viewers. Foul language and racial slurs are abundant, as is the blood. Excellent cast plays their parts well and all are either extremely viscous or extremely good. A fun ride and an excellent western to add to anyone's collection along with the Sergio Leone sets. Enjoy with friends."
Django Unchained (2012),Entertaining but overlong,"Whenever I see film run for almost three hours, there is an inevitable sense of trepidation I feel. Immediately the question beckons: is it a three hour film because the plot needed the time, or is it too long and over indulgent. While this may be a controversial opinion, I think Django Unchained is afflicted with the latter problem. This is a massive shame because apart from its tired, extended, overindulgent pacing, Django Unchained represents a spectacular, mesmerising, and daring innovation in the genre. In true Tarantino style, there is blood everywhere, and the n word is used probably hundreds of times. There are also brilliant central performances in Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicarpio, and of course the inimitable Christoph Waltz. Waltz In particular offers an outstanding performance as a charming, self assured German bounty hunter with European civility and a deep dislike for slavery. The dynamic between Django and Schultz is also interesting for there is a true kinship between these two disparate characters. However I feel the film is definitely way too long, and it is overly indulgent near the middle and end section. Too much time is spent at Candyland inspecting prospective ""Mandingo"" purchases, and there is an extended sequence at the end which is really unnecessary. The film could have easily quit at the bloody shoot out near the end but it chose not to. In fact almost a full 2 hours is spent at candyland itself. While Tarantino is a good suspense writer, I doubt even Hitchcock would have been adept enough to keep teh audience in suspense for a full two hours. Consequently I felt boredom starting to set in near the two hour mark- at the point where I feel the film should have ended. The movie also overplays the oneupmanship of Django and Schultz that it becomes overly grating(oh look, it's another white man surprised at a black man on a horse). I think these flaws make Django unchained way too long. If I could judge a film as a collection of solely it's good bits, Django Unchained is a masterpiece. But a film is ultimately representative of a directors vision, and it must be judged as a whole. Django Unchained in its entirety is a missed opportunity, where a snappier pace would have really made it something great."
Django Unchained (2012),Django Unchained review,"Today I watched Django. Now in my personal opinion, it was one of my favorite movies. (Spoilers) Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of our time and while I've only watched two of his films, I can say that without a doubt he is one of my favorite directors. I loved everything about Django and especially the scene where he blows up Candyland and kills everyone. Jamie Foxx is a talented actor and this movie really helped show how great he is. His talent is impeccable and same can be said with Leonardo DiCaprio, Cristoph Waltz, and Kerry Washington. This movie was thrilling and each second, I was jumping out of my seat, excited. This movie exceeded beyond my expectations and it's really shown me how great film making is. I also have to say that I love the cameo from Quentin Tarantino himself and Jonah Hill. Now, as I said before I haven't watched too many Tarantino films, let alone films in general. However, I recently got more into movies and film making and I've had a blast being able to watch tons of movies over this weekend. I watched Drive yesterday as well and it was phenomenal. I'm indeed getting off topic but this is my first ever review on a movie so I think it can slide. I'm also glad to see Django won 2 Oscar's because it truly deserved it."
Django Unchained (2012),A Really good modern western,"It's a good movie,I would recommend it to everyone who likes western movies,but I wouldn't say it only for Western lovers. It's also another great performance by Christoph Waltz although Jamie Foxx,DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson were also great. It's a long movie,like most Tarantino movie near the 3 hour mark but I say that it's worth it. The First time I saw this movie I didn't even noticed that 3 hours have passed. It depicts the American Wild West and the period of Slavery fairly accuratly. The sound choices are very intesting,you have a lot of western sounding songs and then you Tupacs song at the end. So in conclusion i would recommend this movie
9/10."
Django Unchained (2012),"""Reclaiming Freedom: A Cinematic Journey through 'Django Unchained'""","""Django Unchained,"" directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a bold and visceral film that delves into the dark and harrowing realities of slavery in the United States. Released in 2012, the movie received critical acclaim for its unflinching portrayal of the antebellum South, its powerful performances, and Tarantino's distinctive style. Set in the pre-Civil War era, the story follows Django (played by Jamie Foxx), a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter and seeks to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Alongside him is Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German bounty hunter who becomes Django's mentor and partner. Tarantino's signature style is evident throughout the film, blending a mix of intense violence, sharp wit, and poignant social commentary. The movie doesn't shy away from showcasing the grotesque and inhumane treatment of slaves, using brutality to underscore the harsh realities faced by African Americans during that period. However, it balances this with moments of triumph, empowerment, and vengeance, as Django navigates a path of self-discovery and reclamation of his identity. The performances in ""Django Unchained"" are exceptional. Jamie Foxx delivers a compelling portrayal of Django, displaying both vulnerability and strength in his quest for justice. Christoph Waltz shines as Schultz, with his charismatic and enigmatic portrayal, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, Leonardo DiCaprio's chilling performance as the despicable and charming Candie adds depth to the film's exploration of the inherent evil within the institution of slavery. Moreover, the film's soundtrack, combining an eclectic mix of genres, effectively complements the narrative, enhancing the emotional depth of various scenes. Tarantino masterfully weaves together elements of spaghetti Westerns with a revisionist history approach, creating an alternate reality that empowers its protagonist in a time where power differentials were starkly defined. Through its artistic and dramatic storytelling, the film forces audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about America's history of slavery and racism. However, the film also generated controversy due to its explicit depiction of violence and the use of racial slurs, which some critics argued could be excessive and uncomfortable for some viewers. In conclusion, ""Django Unchained"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that confronts the horrors of slavery while offering a tale of resilience, retribution, and the fight for freedom. It remains a significant and impactful piece of cinema, showcasing Tarantino's ability to blend entertainment with social commentary in a compelling and unforgettable manner."
Tombstone (1993),Dull western.,"A decent western. I have this on DVD and it's not a bad looking film, I don't think it's as good though as My Darling Clementine with it's black and white cinematography, the great climax and Henry Fonda in the lead role. This is more of an ensemble piece. I wasn't really convinced by Kurt Russel in the main role, I think everyone agrees Val Kilmer stole the show. The Plot is a fairly familiar one with cowboys riding around killing people and spreading fear and chaos whether they go. The film has probably too many characters, to the point where you don't really know who the clear main villain is meant to be. The female characters are given a bit to do but I think the female characters are bit too modern. The film does some stuff well by build up the stakes, the dialogue though towards the end gets really bad and the film seems to have about 4 different endings. It's all action in the second half but it goes on too long and you loose track of who is who and what they want. The Kurt Russell portrayal of the character is just a madman by the end too who kills about 40 people, the Henry Fonda portrayal was much better, mature, authoritative but with a cold deadly streak running through him too. Some of the special effects are a bit overdone too, there's a storm in which lightening flashes about every 3 seconds for about 5 minutes which just doesn't happen. The music is decent but again not memorable. The costumes and editing are both fine, nothing distracting and all pretty nicely done. I definitely rate My Darling Clementine though over this."
Tombstone (1993),A timeless classic!,"Tombstone is one of my favorite westerns of all time! The movie features big time stars and big time shootouts. Kurt Russell casted as Wyatt Earp was pure genius. Sam Elliott, Val Kimer, and Bill Paxton were all terrific as well. Trust me you will recognize a lot of big time stars in this one. Even Billy Bob Thorton shows up as a side character who probably has less then 5 minutes of screen time. I absolutely love the story here and the drama/action throughout makes this movie go by at lightning speed. I miss westerns like this and hope movie studios start to release more like them in the near future. Tombstone might not be perfect in critics eyes but it is a picture perfect film in mine. Tombstone gets a perfect 10 stars out of 10 from me."
Tombstone (1993),Only the first half is good,"The first half of the movie is story build-up and most of the ""action"" happens in the second half, so I find it ironic that the first half of the movie is great but the second half is pretty bad in comparison. The part with all the action is actually pretty boring and bland as compared to the first half with almost no action. The second half of this movie goes downhill because the action is so random and mindless without any direction. Someone get shot, then someone else gets shot, then someone else gets shot and so on and on without adding anything to the storyline at all. Also it makes no sense that Ringo invites Wyatt on a one-on-one duel when he was clearly in an advantageous position. Since when bad guys do that when they are already winning? In the second half of the movie even the quality of acting drops significantly. You can see that actors are putting less and less effort into their acting because even they were getting bored of what they were filming."
Tombstone (1993),Slow and meandering,"(1993) Tombstone
WESTERN This is yet another version of Wyatt Earp with already lot more made before this one such as ""My Darling Clementine"" starring Henry Fonda, ""Hour of the Gun"" with James Garner as Earp and ""Gunfight At The OK Corral"" with Burt Lancaster playing the role! This time has Kurt Russel as Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday revisiting the Corral again! The film is OK except that I didn't care much for the ending very much since read somewhere that it wasn't exactly accurate in terms of the Doc Holiday character! The actors shine but feels quite meandering and slow by comparison with the other films made before it! For the time being this is the best rating I can give it."
Tombstone (1993),"Not bad, but remember this is The West, Hollywood . . .","The director Billy Wilder once quipped 'I've seen Paris, France, and I've seen Paris, Hollywood, and frankly I prefer Paris, Hollywood'. Many of us have seen the West in documentary photos and the West in Tinseltown Westerns, and frankly the Tinseltown West gets most people's vote despite the violence and, well, the violence. I say that because just for watching Tombstone (for the second time in 30 years) I've been watching short 'What the West was really like' videos on YouTube, consisting of a great many contemporary photographs as well as information that usually doesn't come our way in courtesy of Tinseltown Western. The Westerns don't tell us of the choleras and tuberculosis epidemic, the horrific of sanitation, the often quite lethal medical 'care' at the hands of and the very, very basic bars. In those photos the women folk are often haggard and are not done up to the nines like the lass who fell for Shane, the men dress just just like the folk back East but are a lot shabbier They were most certainly not done up to the nines with spotless shirts and jackets and bowler hats and the 'baddies' most certainly did not do themselves up with jingle-jangle and picturesque outfit. Gunfights were very rare indeed, as were bank robberies. The town's building were very often very basic jerry-built wooden death traps thrown up over night. The barroom were equally basic, their floors covered with straw to soak up spilled booze but also the phelgm drinkers spat out on the floor, ignoring the spittoons. Along the bar hung a number of towels which everyone used to wipe beer foam from their mouth and which were a major factor in spreading disease and infection. All that and more is why we prefer 'the West', Hollywood, to the rather dispirting real thing. The closest I have seen the fictional West come to what I now know was the real thing was on HBO's Deadwood. And that is also why the second time around my enjoyment and appreciation of Tombstone was decidedly muted. The world Tombstone is 1oo% fantasy. Oh, well. Having said that, fantasy and a make-believe past is exactly what the punters want when the buy their movie tickets and stock up on popcorn to wait for the lights to go out. And in that regard Tombstone is as good as many such films. But don't mistake it for anything but the West, Hollywood."
Tombstone (1993),"Tombstone, a true gem in the Western genre.","Set in the lawless town of Tombstone, Arizona, during the late 1800s, the film follows the Earp brothers as they confront the violence and chaos of the Wild West. Directed by George P. Cosmatos, but reportedly mostly by Kurt Russell, behind the scenes shenanigans aside, Tombstone skillfully captures the serious tone of the genre, retelling classics like 'OK Corral' and 'Hour of the Gun' with more weight. Kevin Jarre's writing takes historical liberties combined with dramatic storytelling, and William A. Fraker's cinematography immerses viewers in the tumultuous world of the Old West. The standout feature of Tombstone is its stellar ensemble cast, including standout performances by Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe. With some superb staging and setups Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday are unforgettable, with Kilmer's performance deserving of an Oscar. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth and emotion to the film, while the supporting cast, including the likes of Sam Elliott as Virgil and Bill Paxton as Morgan, further enriches the story, making Tombstone a character-driven masterpiece. There are also a number of familiar faces like Stephen Lang, Jason Priestley, Michael Rooker, Billy Zane, and Charlton Heston, to name a few. Overall, Tombstone remains a must-see for fans of Westerns, anchored by remarkable performances from its cast. This film secures its place as a timeless classic in the Western genre."
Tombstone (1993),Amazing Film!,"I thought Tombstone was an amazing film. I thoroughly enjoyed all the fighting scenes, the death scenes, all of it, but it was a little silly how they had infinite bullets. I found myself getting excited when new people and ideas were introduced and I thought it was great how the characters developed throughout the movie. The only thing I disliked in the film was the death of doc at the end. I thought he died a good death and lived a good life, but it just didn't seem to feel right. It might've been the delivery and how it wasnt really stated, but nonetheless a great film. I loved this movie and all the funny moments and I'd watch it again."
Tombstone (1993),Western movie with style.,"Tombstone(1993) is an amazing film based in Southeast Arizona in the days of the violent cowboys and the chaos they created. The film is based on a true story that centers around the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and the cowboys of Cochise County. If you're looking for a film that includes drama, violence,and action this film incorporates all these elements. The film was directed by George P. Cosmatos and Kevin Jarre is a very thrilling western styled movie with all elements of such. While watching the film I was very intrigued from the beginning and from there the movie only got better, the casting of this film gives it the final touch of realism. The cast of the movie played a huge role in the making, production, and enjoyment of the film. Kurt Russel(Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer(Doc Holliday), Sam Elliot(Virgiol Earp), Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp), Powers Boothe(Curly Bill Brocius), and Micheal Biehn(Johnny Ringo) played the lead roles and did a magnificent job. The movie felt almost as if you have been sucked into their world entirely. The film incorporated many fight scenes and monologues that made the film even more interesting. Even though the movie is an old film it still has a place in many hearts for many. The film has been one to remember, it's emotional, thrilling, overwhelming,and has many emotions that'll have you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's ever to come. While watching the movie you are faced with many different feelings each with their own opinion. Many people have seen this movie but not many have really dug deep into the deeper meaning of this film, the film can have a different meaning to different people. That is what makes this movie a classic film with great themes, one being that the power of love can affect someone's action. This is shown when one of Wyatt's good friends is killed, he then makes it his duty to kill any cowboys in the town. He was pushed into a killing spree of cowboys. The movie isn't like any other movie to be aired in the world, the movie shows what life was like in the earlier days. The history of this film dates back to the cowboy era in 1880's. The film is historically accurate and includes hints of humor to lighten the mood. In the movie everyone feared the cowboys and that is what gives the movie the entertainment element it has. A film like this is only made once in a lifetime, and the way the film was portrayed was very good. When I watched the film I felt I was watching something made for A-listers. The quality of the film was great, and had great entertainment values. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the early 1880's and its cowboy era. The film was great and had very amazing scenes. My personal favorite character was Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer) . He is what many would call a drunk, but he is an amazing character dedicated to his friends and was a very comical character and I enjoyed watching any scenes he was included in. He was the one character that was able to lighten the mood in any scene. In the film he was very up-beat and was just a generally joking kind of person. While watching the film i felt very involved in the film, I would definitely rewatch the film over and over, until my brain can't handle the overwhelming enjoyment of the film, yes the movie is just that good."
Tombstone (1993),Tombstone review,"I really liked the movie Tombstone the part that i liked the most was close to the end of the movie when the guy was sick in the bed and ask ""what's it like having one of those medals"" after a little bit he went out to fight the guy that challenge one of his friends so when he got there he got into a 1 on 1 battle with the enemy the sick guy ended won the battle by shooting the enemy in the head, that part of the movie was my favorite part i liked it how he was sick and knew if that his friend went to battle he would of lost so that means that he really did care about his friend like they were brothers when his friend got there at the battle he was surprise to to him there because he was really sick and couldn't get out of the bed but overall i really loved this movie."
Tombstone (1993),A good film to pass the time,"Tombstone is a great western film that makes you fall in love with its interesting characters. The story follows Wyatt Earp after moving to Tombstone, Arizona where he meets up with his friend Doc Holliday to stop a band of outlaws that go by ""The Cowboys"" that begin to terrorize the town of Tombstone. The classic wild west shootouts and its compelling storyline with its memorable scenes from the help of Kurt Russell's perfect performance as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, Tombstone is a good movie to kill time. While it is not one of the best pieces of western films, Tombstone certainly is up there along with the greats."
The Hateful Eight (2015),Tarantino does it again,"I've never considered myself a Quentin Tarantino fanatic, but I have to admit that I find most of his films highly enjoyable and this one is no exception, undoubtedly a worthy addition to his illustrious catalogue. The movie starts and we are out in the wild. The scenery is hostile but nonetheless gorgeous in typical Western fashion. It's so well done you feel you'll start freezing at any moment. The opening scene already sets the tone: erratic characters, suspicion, secrets, dirty mouths and of course a gunfight is always round the corner. By the way, style over substance is a common criticism regarding Tarantino's work and while it's true The Hateful Eight is dazzlingly stylish, this doesn't detract from the story - quite the contrary, it makes for even more compelling storytelling. There are very few moments where the Tarantino touch would qualify as over the top or unnecessary. One defining feature of the movie is that more or less in its entirety takes place in one room, a risky choice on paper, which definitely works here, as it creates interesting dynamics between this group of seemingly random characters who are busy trying to survive the frost and solve an Agatha Christie type of mystery. It's fascinating watching the tension reach a boiliing point, a bloodbath waiting to happen. Every character has an interesting background on his own, but it's the interactions between them that elevate the movie to the next level. This is achieved mostly through dialogue, one of the movie's highlights. Punchlines are fyling left and right, people start ranting and raving out of nowhere, while the occasional socio-political commentary adds another element. There are also non-verbal details, amplified by the fabulous cast. Even though it's hard to sympathise with any of them - they are hateful, indeed - they are presented in a three dimensional way that invites you to see their point of view and try to understand their state of mind and guess their motives. Ennio Morricone delivers as usual, though the music is not one the first things that stand out, one could argue his presence is rather thin. The movie totally justifies its relatively long running time, as it flows effortlessly and doesn't drag at any point."
The Hateful Eight (2015),One of Quentin Tarantino's many greats!,"""The Hateful Eight"" is a wonderful western film that is somewhat of a murder mystery in which all of your questions slowly get answered. I liked this movie mainly because it's a Quentin Tarantino film, and all of his films are really funny and intriguing. Samuel L. Jackson was also a really big part in this movie and most of Quentin's other works as well. The casting in this movie was absolutely stunning in terms of performance and popularity and I love that Quentin Tarantino can keep it consistent in his films with his cast. This movie really has no flaws and the director only helps even more, 10/10, thank you Quentin Tarantino."
The Hateful Eight (2015),Dialogue heavy Tarantino classic,"QT has always delivered in his ability to put the viewer in the shoes of the characters through heavy dialogue, even when the conversations seem monotonous or insignificant this tactic really gives the viewers a feel for what it would be like in the shoes of a [hitman, robber, outlaw, bounty hunter]. This movie is the pinnacle of this and the performances by the whole cast keeps the viewer engaged, cold and claustrophobic throughout its entirety. I can see why some may not approve, however, if you are a fan of Tarantino and westerns, then this will be a gem. My review is too short so words words words."
The Hateful Eight (2015),I definitely don't hate it.,"I think tonight was the first time I've seen this since it was in cinemas. I vaguely remember seeing it twice at the movies - both during Southern Hemisphere summer. It's now December, which is the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. I don't feel like I'm doing The Hateful Eight many favors by watching it while the weather's warm. I'm not sure I can add much to what other people say about The Hateful Eight, because I generally agree with the general consensus. It is not nearly one of his best films, but it's still packed with great dialogue, some incredibly strong acting, and beautiful/distinctive visuals mixed with an excellent Ennio Morricone score that finally got him the Oscar win he should've gotten like, 50 years earlier, for one of the Sergio Leone Westerns. Something that I do feel has impacted the 2010s era (and perhaps beyond) of Tarantino's filmography is the loss of Sally Menke. She edited movies of his that were long and sometimes patiently paced (Pulp Fiction and especially Jackie Brown - both of which were over 2.5 hours), but things felt more purposeful and tighter. She was someone who was able to tell Tarantino no, it seemed, but she didn't tell him no just to get a kick out of things. She told him no when he was unable to realize, and he seemed to listen. Just about every movie of his she edited has perfect pacing. Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood... I really like all these movies, but each feels about 15 minutes too long and all run the risk of feeling a tiny bit dragged down in places. Because everything else outside the editing works, these three most recent Tarantino films are still a blast. I've seen Django Unchained three times I think, Hateful Eight three times, and I know I saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood twice in cinemas. I really like these films, but I don't love them. I also thought I might complain about how mean The Hateful Eight is, but that's totally the point. It's in the title, and the film is Tarantino deliberately pushing things far and having a whole cast full of jerks just abuse, taunt, and eventually kill each other. Subjectively, I can say I like it when some of his characters have a little heart (Jules realizing the errors of his ways in Pulp Fiction, the motherly instincts of The Bride in Kill Bill, the genuinely sweet connection between Pam Grier and Robert Forster's characters in the surprisingly heartfelt Jackie Brown), but that's just me. Objectively, Tarantino made a movie called The Hateful Eight, and at least eight of these characters were crazy hateful. It hits me that Tarantino absolutely made the exact movie he wanted to make, and I have to respect any kind of vision this vast being realized."
The Hateful Eight (2015),"6 Stars, But Only For the Musical Score.","Unlike Quentin Tarantino the legendary film musical score composer Ennio Morricone didn't try to repeat himself. On the contrary, he did seek to avoid it, and even if this film's director hopefully didn't expect another timeless stroke of new inventional genius like in Sergio Leone's masterpiece, the iconic The Good The Bad And The Ugly, he probably didn't quite expect what he got, regardless. However, The Hateful Eight is far from a masterpiece, and not even a fully fitting musical score from the very best can make Tarantino's study of western clichés, and his signature hyper violent final into a great film. Nevertheless, just listening to the Maestro's music is much more interesting. Still, I wish that Ennio Morricone would get his well deserved Oscar for Cinema Paradiso instead, like he should."
The Hateful Eight (2015),Tarantino needs to go to Broadway,"My first Tarantino film where I felt bored. Talk, talk, talk, talk, kill. Once you get the rhythm down it becomes repetitive. I have always felt that Tarantino the director has done an excellent job of editing Tarantino the writer. Not this time. Feels like a play in almost every aspect. Great performances, great score, great cinematography. All take a back seat to the overly verbal screenplay. I think Tarantino would make a brilliant Broadway writer. He is very suited for it. But as film it is less than the sun of its parts. He rebounded nicely with Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. The only other film of his that was similar was Reservoir Dogs. It basically took place in one location, a where house. It was also overly written."
The Hateful Eight (2015),Extended version review,"Pros: A lot of suspense and tension filled sequences
The film truly shines when Sam Jackson is in control
You don't know what will happen next
If that was really the actress' voice singing while playing the guitar, that was really impressive! As was her performance. Kurt was good Cons: Way way, too long
Boring at times
Overdrawn, convoluted, irrelevant conversation does little to add value to the movie
Way too much use of the ""N"" word
We aren't meant to care about any of 8 outside of Kurt and Sam which are essentially the ""protagonists"" of the movie
Channing Tatum? Hiding under the floorboards is reminiscent of inglorious basterds
Huge plot hole is that Kurt has his back turned several times to board the door shut him when just him and the prisoner first entered, more than ample opportunity to pop him quick."
The Hateful Eight (2015),A Tense Snowstorm of Suspicion and Secrets,"Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' is a masterclass in suspense, dialogue-driven tension, and character interplay. Set predominantly in a single, claustrophobic location during a raging blizzard, the film grips you with its intricate narrative and keeps you guessing till the very end. Tarantino's signature style of long, engaging conversations and sudden bursts of violence is ever-present, making every moment an unpredictable thrill. The ensemble cast, featuring the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, delivers performances that are both riveting and nuanced. Ennio Morricone's haunting score adds another layer of unease, perfectly complementing the movie's bleak and tension-filled atmosphere. 'The Hateful Eight' is not just a film-it's an immersive experience into the minds and motives of flawed individuals forced into a perilous situation. It's a Tarantino spectacle in its rawest form, making it an essential watch for fans of intense, dialogue-driven cinema."
The Hateful Eight (2015),"Some excellent parts, and some boring parts","There are some excellent, tense, and well acted scenes sprinkled throughout, but the film is about 30 minutes too long. Some of the scenes are drawn out way too long. I can't believe there's an extended version of this. I enjoyed the film once they got to the Haberdashery, but pretty much everything that happened before they arrived there could have been cut from the film. While I feel the ending is appropriate, I don't like it. I'm not entirely sure why, but it bothers me the way the film concluded. The cinematography and effects are excellent though and the setting really adds to the tension of the story, but I really have no desire to ever watch this one again."
The Hateful Eight (2015),I didn't care about any of them eight hateful guys and that was the only problem.,"The Hateful Eight. In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters. Obviously, this is a very good movie but I ended up disappointed somehow. It's a slow burning thriller, you can't know what is going to happen next, very hard to predict as a western movie should be and as a Tarantino movie should be most particularly. The atmosphere was there, those snowy scenes were great with those beautiful soundtracks and the cinematography was just wonderful. Nothing bad about directing, it's a masterclass from the man himself Quentin. I really enjoyed the dialogs either, they were mostly well-written and funny especially Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins, those were the funniest but the best performance here is by far 's. I have to mention that I really didn't care about any of them eight hateful guys, I didn't know much about them to care so that was a thing that bordered me and I tried to enjoy the thing and the mystery and I did but not quietly like I wanted. Once again this is a good movie, a very well-made western and I wish I could love it a bit more."
The Magnificent Seven (2016),"""Riding High: 'The Magnificent Seven' Reloads the Western Genre with Epic Brilliance""","""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) stands tall as a modern Western masterpiece. Antoine Fuqua's direction skillfully balances homage with innovation. Denzel Washington's commanding presence as Sam Chisolm anchors the film, leading a stellar ensemble cast. Chris Pratt injects charismatic humor, while Ethan Hawke adds depth to his conflicted character. The cinematography paints sweeping landscapes, enhancing the epic showdowns. The film's strength lies in its compelling characters, each with a distinct background, forging a genuine camaraderie. From the pulse-pounding action sequences to the emotional core, it captivates. A harmonious blend of homage, charisma, and substance, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is a triumph in the Western genre, resonating with both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers."
The Magnificent Seven (2016),Good and evil easily distinguished,"Thought it was a very good movie. I'm not into PC at all, this wasn't that. Guns were present, manly men were present and a decent person versus an evil person had nothing to do with race. Skilled men, not perfect men, took a job for money. In the end they fought for a good cause. Humanity is complicated. The overall depiction of that complexity was pretty good, without making it overly focused on one person's inner regrets and demons. Without too much effort spent on developing any one character's background, it was pretty easy to fill in each of their stories enough to be satisfied. Loved the unlikely friendships formed. The seven may have, for the first time, found a noble cause to fight for. And... it was very entertaining!"
The Magnificent Seven (2016),How is this rated as highly as it is???,"This movie is terrible. There has to get that out of the way. I'm blown away that this is rated a 7 on here. I could see 5 but 7??? I'm sorry but it's just so bad, I can't get my head around it. So corny, full of terrible cliches, the dialogue is horrible (more on that later), the characters are not believable. The way people speak in this movie is the most unbelievable thing about it. It's so clear that it was written by some hollywood hacks with no knowledge of anything, most of all good writing. One example - the good guy shoots a bad guy in the ear, bad guy exclaims 'oh, my ear'....no joke. That's how bad it is. Why would they even remake this and make it way worse than the original? Who knows. Obviously those people aren't that bright, but I bet they think they are. Do yourself a favour and watch the original from 1960. Now that movie is like an 8 or 9. To think that this travesty is rated only 1 point lower on IMDB makes me really question a lot of things. If they copied the 1960s script but with modern day actors it might have been enjoyable."
The Magnificent Seven (2016),The Magnificent Film,"The Magnificent Seven, a riveting Western saga, earns a solid 7/10 in my cinematic roundup-a testament to its charismatic ensemble, led by Denzel Washington's stoic prowess and Chris Pratt's roguish charm. The film's strength lies in its explosive action sequences and the camaraderie that simmers among the diverse group of gun-toting heroes. While the editing maintains a swift pace, a minor weakness appears in the occasional predictability of the plot. The musical score, echoing the grandeur of the Old West, adds a timeless layer to the film's atmosphere. Cinematography paints sweeping landscapes and intense gunfights with a cinematic brush, elevating the visual experience. The Magnificent Seven, with its blend of old-school Western grit and contemporary flair, stands tall as an entertaining homage to the genre, where bullets fly and heroes rise in a symphony of chaos and justice."

The Magnificent Seven (2016),A Must Watch!,"I know if you grew up with the old/primal one it's difficult to open your mind to the new. Especially with such a diverse cast. But since I grew up with an open mind and not back in the Stone Age I absolutely love this movie! Each cast member brought something new and fresh and most welcome to the remake. I loved the new You've got to go into this with an open mind. If you love any of these actors, I believe you'll enjoy this remake. Who doesn't love Denzel Washington or Chris Pratt?!! I have come to believe Ethan Hawke has found his niche in Western movies. He looks great and plays the part famously. And it's not the first western he's been in lately."
The Magnificent Seven (2016),Wildly Underrated,"I don't have a problem with remakes, some of them are excellent. ""The Magnificent Seven"" is excellent. Everything about it works. It looks great and the music is just as good. The cast is terrific with never better work from Ethan Hawke. Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar. The script is top-notch with dialogue that was fun to listen to. There are more than a handful of really cool moments in this movie. The movie builds and builds until it reaches its very satisfying conclusion. I need to watch this movie more often. (I saw ""the Magnificent Seven"" in the theater went it first came out.)"
The Magnificent Seven (2016),The Cinematography,"It was good, but what was very impressive was the cinematography, camera angles and stunt work. It was filmed beautifully! Also great cast and story, even for a remake! It was interesting to see all the characters interact and work together to defend the town. I really thought Denzel Washington was amazing. Also Ethan Hawke as the coward, did a great job. The ending is a bit different then most Westerns. Even if you are devoted to the original , you should watch this one because it stands out and is well done. So go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed. I read these other reviews, but I'm glad I watched it and wrote my own!"
The Magnificent Seven (2016),"Not As Magnificent as Original, But Good","In the world of westerns, few films are as iconic as the original 1960's ""The Magnificent Seven."" The 2016 version, directed by Antoine Fuqua, ambitiously attempts to rekindle the magic of its predecessor for a contemporary audience, and for the most part, it succeeds. The story, familiar to many, is a tale of heroism, camaraderie, and redemption. A desperate town, tormented by a ruthless industrialist, seeks the help of seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers, and hired guns. Together, these seven men, each with their own motives and pasts, band together to protect the town. Fuqua assembles an impressive ensemble cast led by Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt, who both deliver solid performances. Washington's calm and controlled presence as Sam Chisolm is contrasted perfectly by Pratt's quick-witted and charming Faraday. Each of the other five members brings their own unique flavor to the mix, creating a diverse and dynamic group that audiences can root for. The film's direction is impressive, particularly during the action scenes. Fuqua's ability to choreograph and execute grand scale shootouts is on full display here. The climactic battle sequence, in particular, is both thrilling and visually spectacular, a testament to the director's knack for action. From a cinematographic standpoint, the film is gorgeous, capturing the vast, arid landscapes and frantic chaos of battle with equal finesse. The musical score by the late James Horner, completed posthumously by Simon Franglen, pays homage to the classic western scores, successfully setting the mood and enhancing the action on screen. ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016), however, is not without its flaws. While it checks all the boxes for a fun, action-packed western, it falls short in terms of character development. With a running time of just over two hours, the film struggles to flesh out its characters beyond their archetypical roles. Also, while the story is enjoyable, it doesn't provide many surprises or innovative twists, leaning heavily on genre conventions. Despite these criticisms, ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) shines in its ability to entertain. The film manages to balance intense action sequences with moments of humor and camaraderie among the seven protagonists. While it may not have the enduring impact of the original, it is an enjoyable ride that will leave audiences excited and engaged. In conclusion, ""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) is a solid action-packed western that delivers on the promise of its genre. With a stellar cast, thrilling action sequences, and a nostalgic nod to its roots, it provides a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience, especially for fans of action and western films."
The Magnificent Seven (2016),A surprising delight,Never saw the original so I went into it without any previous knowledge of the movie. Was not expecting much from this but being a Denzel Washington fan I decided to give it a watch. Witty and funny with a catchy storyline. Was not waiting for the end and enjoyed Chris Pratts banter. Denzel of course was great and can't beat him in a western. Ethan Hawke was cast well and I enjoyed his character development. Ending was not terribly predictable. Overall the movie was exciting with plenty of nice quips and laughs. Would watch it again and would recommend it to others. Makes me want to go back and watch the original.
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",The epic Western masterpiece,"""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is an epic Western masterpiece that stands as a pinnacle of the genre, showcasing Sergio Leone's directorial genius and the iconic collaboration between director and composer in Ennio Morricone's timeless score. This film is a symphony of tension, grit, and panoramic vistas that have etched themselves into the annals of cinematic history. At the heart of the film is the timeless tale of three gunslingers-Clint Eastwood's laconic and enigmatic Blondie (the Good), Lee Van Cleef's ruthless and calculating Angel Eyes (the Bad), and Eli Wallach's cunning and volatile Tuco (the Ugly). Their intertwining paths in search of buried Confederate gold lead to a mesmerizing showdown against the backdrop of the American Civil War. Leone's masterful direction captures the vastness of the American Southwest with sweeping cinematography that paints a breathtaking portrait of desolate landscapes and hauntingly beautiful panoramas. Every frame is meticulously crafted, emphasizing the harshness of the frontier while elevating it to a mythical realm where the lawless thrive. Morricone's evocative score, punctuated by the haunting twang of the iconic main theme, serves as a character in itself, enhancing the film's tension and drama. The marriage of Leone's visuals and Morricone's music creates an immersive experience that lingers in the minds of audiences long after the final duel has concluded. What sets this film apart is its meticulous attention to character development amidst the grandeur of its setting. Each protagonist is imbued with depth and complexity, evolving beyond archetypes to embody the nuances of human nature. Eastwood's stoic presence, Van Cleef's chilling menace, and Wallach's flamboyant portrayal collectively create a dynamic trio that commands the screen. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" transcends the boundaries of the Western genre, exploring themes of greed, morality, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Leone's deft storytelling captivates audiences with its blend of suspense, humor, and raw intensity, building toward a climactic showdown that remains one of cinema's most iconic moments. Decades since its release, this film remains an enduring classic, revered for its groundbreaking visuals, memorable characters, and a narrative that epitomizes the essence of the Wild West. Its influence on cinema is immeasurable, leaving an indelible mark on the Western genre and inspiring generations of filmmakers with its cinematic grandeur and timeless storytelling."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)","Iconic Yet Imperfect: 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' Earns a Solid 7/10 for Its Western Legacy.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly straps you into a cinematic saddle for a thrilling journey through the rough and tumble of the Old West. Clint Eastwood's steely-eyed charisma and the iconic standoff scenes make it a must-see classic for any movie buff. Ennio Morricone's haunting score adds an extra layer of intensity, weaving seamlessly into the dusty landscapes and echoing the heart of this spaghetti western. However, saddled with a 7/10 rating, it's not a flawless ride. While the showdowns deliver the promised adrenaline, there are moments when the pacing slows to a meander. The film's commitment to the 'ugly' side of the West, though gritty and authentic, occasionally overstays its welcome. Yet, despite these bumps in the trail, the film remains a stalwart in the genre, a testament to its lasting impact on the cinematic landscape."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)","Extremely cool, stylish and violent western","An extremely cool, stylish and violent western from the 1960s. The film has this weird blend of style and realism, it's a pretty violent film, and characters are tortured for information, there's a real thread of greed and individualism throughout, everyone is ought for themselves in this, trying to get their hands on some stolen gold. The music is simply awesome, it's got to be perhaps my most beloved and memorable music soundtrack that I can think of. The film does a good job in maintaining an era of mystery and sheer magmatism to the Eastwood character, he's a man of few of words but when he speaks people listen. This is a real man's film, there's basically no female characters, set during the US Civil War it manages to use that as a backdrop to the movie. While these 3 men are out to get rich and possibly kill one another doing it there's a level of suffering and death going on around them on a colossal scale as armies clash and men die in their thousands. Angel Eyes makes a great villain yet there's almost no truly good or heroic characters in this movie, any character who is shown as being good like a prostitute, a priest or a dying captain in a POW camp are shown as being unable to be helpless mostly and at the mercy of events, while it's the bad characters who tend to be strong and powerful. It's a film of killers hunted by killers hunted by killers. So improbable too is the accuracy and irony of some of the shooting in this film that it almost begins to border on parody. This is no story of a good sheriff trying to protect his town from bad men and who at the end of the film will need to walk down the town's main avenue or into the bar for a final shootout. The landscape of Spain works really well for this film, the barren dusty landscape with little vegetation and the whitewashed brick houses. As mentioned this is a man's world, violent and dangerous, with lots of double crossing, there's little honour among thieves here. Yet everything is also happening in this heightened, unrealistic almost dreamy way, it's very hard to explain. The Eastwood character goes through great suffering in one scene but is then unaffected for the rest of the movie, he just turns back into the macho mysterious enigmatic character again he was at the start. There's no good sheriff in this movie to step in and sort things out, it's like there's no law at all in many places. It's a warn torn country and it's fitting that it finishes in a graveyard. On a technical level the film looks great, the editing is slick and fast, the cinematography is really well done and probably a bit ahead of it's time. Overall this film always leaves such a strong impression on me, it's impossible to be indifferent to."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",The Greatest Western?,"The Hunt for gold is on, two bounty hunters form an uncomfortable alliance, in order to track it down. As Christmas approaches, this is the perfect way to get into the spirit of things, a movie I used to watch with my dad, who's sadly passed away. The opening music should be enough to get you hooked, one of that most famous, most catchy and best known scores of all, fantastic. I'd argue this is still Clint Eastwood's greatest movie, and he is awesome in it, talk about Mr Cool, he commands the screen. It's a tremendous movie, action packed, hugely entertaining, and at times pretty funny, it really does offer something for everyone. Great dialogue, great camera work, great visuals, this film doesn't have a single weakness, it genuinely is one of the greatest films of all time, even if you're not a huge lover of Westerns, there is still something here to enjoy. It's fabulous. 10/10."

This movie definitely deserve 10/10."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",One of the greatest of all time,"For many years this was my favorite movie. This is a story about men, for men. There's not that much dialogue, and much of the brilliance of it is how much is said without a word, and how these men are deeply connected, and in a way brothers, despite being 'enemies'. There are so many iconic moments in this movie, that it's impossible and pointless to cover them. The music is incredible, the cinematography genius, etc. One of my favorite scenes in cinema of all time is after Tuco lyingly brags about how he is lucky that his loving brother fed him, to which Blondie responds by 'generously' giving him a cigar to complement his meal, the following 10 seconds where Tuco silently looks at Blondie, accepts the cigar, grudgingly smokes it, and smiles, are probably the best 10 seconds in cinema history. I'm dinging it by one star as in parts it drags a bit and is too long."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",Funny and Adventurous with a Few Flaws with the Pacing,"""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966) feels old, for sure, but certainly not boring! In fact, given the year it was made and given its running time, this film is unexpectedly entertaining. It has 3 characters trying to get to something that will make them wealthy. Each of them has a story, is well developed, and is unique - both in character and in appearance. The cast does a super job, the script is well written, the movie is entertaining. The good pacing is lost at times, which I didn't like, but it's by no means boring. The soundtrack is legendary. Watch it, but I warn you - it's not for everyone just because of the pacing, which may be a bigger problem for some people than it was for me. Overall, I had a super great time with the characters and their adventure. PS. Eli Wallach steals the show :) Final Score: 7/10."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",A Cinematic Triumph,"Ennio Morricone's score is an integral part of the film's DNA. The hauntingly evocative theme music, particularly the iconic whistling, has become synonymous with the spaghetti western genre. Morricone's ability to enhance the emotional depth of each scene through his music is nothing short of magical. The narrative unfolds like a classic quest, with each character driven by their own motivations and code of ethics, or lack thereof. Leone skillfully weaves elements of greed, loyalty, and betrayal into the plot, creating a tale that transcends the boundaries of a traditional western. The film's climax, set against the backdrop of a Civil War cemetery, is a cinematic triumph, a perfect blend of tension, action, and poetic justice. ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" is not just a western; it's a commentary on the nature of humanity, wrapped in the guise of a thrilling adventure. Leone's storytelling prowess, coupled with the memorable performances and Morricone's unforgettable score, elevates this film to the pantheon of cinematic greatness."
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)","The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a towering achievement.","Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad and the Ugly, remains a western masterpiece. This movie may have a long run time, but it takes FULL advantage of it, never becoming a filler title or dragging in the pacing. Clint Eastwood is great here as well, as the iconic cowboy that changed the face of westerns forever, in the role he was born to play. Editing is top notch. Cinematography is beautiful, the sound mixing was on point with a great balance of subtle, atmospheric sound effects and loud booms and gunshots. Ennio Morricones score is exceptional, the story was interesting, and the costumes, makeup and production design were extremely faithful to the feel of the old west, from tumbleweeds, to Clint Eastwoods outfit. This was just a precise, enthralling epic, that deserves to be seen. I absolutely adore this film. What's done here is a grand achievement."

The Revenant (I) (2015),Tight,"I can see why Mr DeCaprio got the gig as best actor in this unsettling movie. It is long and torturous/punishing/painful/cutting from the start up. Photog work first class. Locations can't be beat. Colour and sound top shelf. I appreciate that possibly its aim was to educate modern Western man as to the evils dumped on Indiginous peoples of the Americas and their (Indig) gutsy fight back. The monster bear attack on Leonardo
Is as good as it gets. Trained bear I don't think so. Extreme CGI most likely. The firearm flintlock weapons are accurate except for Leonardo getting off a few rounds on horseback ( reload skill)?? Now Mr Tom Hardy. He prefers not good guy gigs. Those penetrative steely eyes spooky. His monster chap Bane viz Batman growl is as usual difficult to decipher. Much like the backwoods movie he made in Liquor Mountain Dew Grog Prohibited America (Lawless). His rubbery lips deliver hard to define language. All up a too hard too real too tight slice of early America. Not intertained however riveted to what comes next. Smiley."
The Revenant (I) (2015),Stunning cinematography but with some weaker elements,"Superb filmmaking involving long takes, lots of ground level action, close ups, characters as grisly as the bear they encounter. The story features themes of solitude, family, survival, loss and rebirth. The story plays out against a backdrop of greed, savagery plunder and violence as a spiral of destruction sweeps across the film. The film favours natural lighting as well as great set and costume design transporting you back in time. The landscape is stark, bleak yet beautiful, the cinematography is gorgeous, pretty as it is though the message is that the winter wilderness is deadly and our protagonist must battle against exposure and the elements throughout the film. The only time the relentless winter really lets up is in the dream sequences. The film features a subplot too about some French baddies who kidnap an native American woman. If I'd say anything negative about the film then it would be our hero is implausibly lucky throughout which begins to shatter your suspension of disbelief at a few points, especially the part of him falling off the cliff into the tree. The overall story also becomes fairly predictable with it's fair share of tropes."
The Revenant (I) (2015),Fantastic cinematography let down by story,"The cinematography is absolutely fantastic. It was the only part of the revenant that made me watch it to the end. Flawless, a dream in 4k hdr. The Oscar is well deserved. The rest is disappointing. The movie states it is all about realism. Fight scenes are gruesome realistic, so seems to be the bear attack. However the 'hero' is so badly wounded that he has no chance of survival. Especially when he is left alone, incapable of walking, open wounds, broken legs in the wilderness in the middle of winter. Ridiculous. He survives all that and heals on the way. So much for realism. If the story would have a mystical aspect or an 'over the top' action hero all that might work. But the film insist on being close to reality. Which it isn't at all. And this disturbed me extremely throughout the movie. Sadly the characters are one dimensional only. They are not properly introduced as persons. Actually it is very hard to relate to anyone. Character Glass is in survival and revenge mode, nothing else. 'Evil' Fitzgerald has zero development as well. In the end the cinematography is stellar, the rest is 'meh'. The proclaimed realism is an annoying lie."
The Revenant (I) (2015),"A tough and raw story of adventure, survival and desire for revenge, being inspired by real events.","In the early 19th century, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), his explorer High Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), and the rest of the fur trapping expedition are attacked by a group of Indians. The few members of the group who manage to survive flee with the skins on a boat. Abandoned by the crew, Glass attempts to cross the desolate wasteland with only one idea in mind: revenge; and especially against a damned enemy, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). They left him for dead, he wouldn't forget it !. They just couldn't find the time to bury him. They should have done it. The savagery of nature against the will of a man. He is dead, they thought. He is dead, they hoped. The man who was left for dead. Join his wild fight. He could make it out alive. Left alone to die. . . His only thought was to stay alive. One who has returned, as from the dead. Lost blood. Found life. Relentless revenge and a crude fight for survival are the main pillars of this interesting film. Loosely based on the book of the same name by Michael Punke, it narrates the difficult days on the brink of death of a real person, Hugh Glass, a trapper and explorer from the early 19th century about whom there is very little verified data, thus there is no record of whether or not this prominent historic figure had a wife and children. DiCaprio's character is based on real mountain man Hugh Glass, and one of the two men left to await Glass's death was a very young Jim Bridger. This story was also previously adapted into another good film: ¨The Man in the wilderness (1971)¨ by Richard T. Heffron with Richard Harris. Due to the success of The Revenant (2015), which sparked growing interest in this film, Warner Brothers released The Man in the Wilderness on Blu-ray on August 16, 2016, as part of its Warner Archive Collection. And the central theme 'one man's fight against the natural environment across a dangerous snowy landscape' was also dealt with in other films, such as: 'Jeremiah Johnson (by Sidney Pollack)', 'The Man Called Horse (by Eliott Silverstein and also starring Richard Harris)¨ and ¨The Return of a Man Called Horse (by Irwin Keshner)¨. In Revenant 2015 there are many strong scenes and lots of cold-blooded deaths, and despite some bloody images and various acts of violence, the film is rated PG-16. Stunning performance stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a brave fur trapper, left for dead after a bear attack, who recovers and pursues his former companions through risky Indian territory. His portrayal of Hugh Glass earned him numerous awards, in addition to the Oscar and the Golden Globe. He personally performed the stunts, doing his perilous own stunts, without stand-in. Another great protagonist is Tom Hardy, nominated for an Oscar for his role as the evil John Fitzgerald, giving an adequate performance as the hateful Fitzgerald. DiCaprio and Hardy are well accompanied by excellent supporting actors, including the following: Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson and Kristoffer Joner. This The Revenant (2015) was the winner of three Oscars (director, lead actor and photography) and three Golden Globes (dramatic film, director in a dramatic film and actor) in addition to many other prizes. Also noteworthy is the excellent soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto, as well as the spectacular and multi-award-winning photography by Mexican Emmanuel Lubezki. Well directed and co-written (along with Mark L. Smith) by Alejandro G. Iñarritu (Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, Birdman), who offers an impressive and colorful story. Rating: 7.5/10. Leonardo DiCaprio fans will really like the film."

The Revenant (I) (2015),Terrible movie,Wow. Just wow. Lol This movie totally and utterly SUCKS. There's nothing in it that's remotely interesting. It doesn't tell you when or where it is which leaves you in the dark. But the movie is just simply bad apart from that too. I've never seen a movie that was worse than this. Seriously. And I've seen a lot of stinkers. This movie won Oscars. Surely this is one of the worst movies or the single worst movie to ever win Oscars. It's just not interesting. This movie is really something to behold. You are warned. I don't know what the movie makers were thinking with this. Boy did they ever screw up. It was very surprising to me watching this mess since it got such good reviews.
The Revenant (I) (2015),Its just something missing,"The movie is like a pizza without cheese , you eat it , its good but something that you expected to be there is just not there I have seen this movie before when it came out, was not so fond about it, but gave it a second chans now and still not so fond about it , I should love it but I dont, something is just missing, production is good, acting is good, the idea of the story is good,, but its how they make the story thats have weak spots, it should have been written again , shorter and realistic Someone wrote a review and called it very realistic , well that guy havnt been out that much , mostly home with tv games I guess,,, this movie is alot but its not realistic, prettyboy must be a vampire how often he should have died."
The Revenant (I) (2015),"Not Impactful, Awful Acting","Some of the worst lead acting ever. Leonardo DiCaprio huffs his Oscar-bribing booger into a lens for nearly four hours, while tom hardy mumbles to climax. Long shots of silent walking that probably took 4 months to film, and ultimately rendered zero narrative impact. The shots are over-indulgent, the acting is forced and fractured, the narrative is slogging and unrewarding. Overall, it's a film I regretted paying to see in theatres as it didn't live up to the bandwagoned praise at all. The fight with the bear is so obviously fake in close-shots it made me laugh in the theatre. Everyone always goes on about that scene...I genuinely cant find any redeeming qualities for this film. I think the crew members were beasts though - apparently this went over budget and time by many months ... and that weather was gnarly. They deserved a better outcome. Crap directing."
The Revenant (I) (2015),I love it,"""The Revenant"" is a mixture of an art-house western and a revenge flick, and although it's an excellent film, it's not suitable for everyone. The movie is somber and violent, with realistic and gritty violence that makes it an engrossing drama. The story follows Hugh Glass, a fur trapper from the early 1800s, who is mauled by a grizzly bear and abandoned to die by his comrades. The movie revolves around his journey to survive and take revenge on those who betrayed him. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Glass is a brilliant performance that captures the character's agony and misery in a genuine manner. Tom Hardy also gives a remarkable performance as the antagonist. Domhnall Gleeson's depiction of Captain Henry brings a sense of benevolence and empathy to the film, while Will Poulter's acting is exceptional in his role. Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director, deserves praise for choosing to use live performances and natural light instead of green screens. The visual effects are extraordinary, making the bear attack scene horrifyingly realistic. The cinematography is also remarkable, with some breathtaking tracking shots. The music is the only aspect where the movie falls short. It's intrusive, melancholic, and irritating, with some whiny ""Ligeti-style"" elements that do not improve the experience. Overall, ""The Revenant"" is a magnificent film, but it's not a movie that leaves you feeling good. It's intense and violent, with a final confrontation that is one of the most visceral fight scenes in recent years."
The Revenant (I) (2015),The Revenant,"The Revenant is a mix between a western and an adventure movie. It is a true story. It is one of bests Iñarritu's films. Is the best Leonardo Dicaprio's performance of his al career. Is about an explorer (Leonardo DiCaprio) that is attacked by a bear and was abandones by his partners. One of them (Tom Hardy) is one of the meanest carachters of the cinema story. The begining of this movie is one of the best scenes of the cinema history, half western half war movie. It is very violent and the photographs are very good. I think that the end is a little bit worse than the other part of the movie, but it is a very good movie and if you like westerns and adventure films is obligatory to watch it."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),Welcome to Bright Hope,"Every other week it seems that yet another film pushes back the bounds of acceptable screen violence. 'Bone Tomahawk' certainly doesn't stint on the gore, includes a truly horrible collection of cannibals and assails the viewer with a variety of eye-watering sights including a scalping and a beheading and unfolds like a living nightmare. The promise of ultra-violence obviously pulled the punters in, but the film actually has a dry sense of humour manifest in dialogue like ""Does anyone know how to spell troglodytes?"", a young woman in the throes of passion quietly murmuring ""please continue"" and a discussion of the practicalities of reading a book in the bath."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),"Original,grim, witty, slow, and worth your time","A grim and promising opening scene suggests the novels of Cormac McCarthy. Then some long exposition, maybe a little too long, setting up characters and relationships. The cast is strong, so it's watchable, but it could use a bit more energy. The film picks up very well when the search party sets out on horseback to rescue a character's wife who's been abducted by entities called ""troglodytes"". The latter are suitably threatening and hideous in appearance, and they appear to have unusual ""tastes"". Once scene in this sequence will be horrifically memorable for most viewers. Very nice location photography is a plus, as several shots place the characters at a distance, amid atmospheric landscapes. The violence quotient in this movie is gradual, building to some nice payoff, even if much of it is predictable. But not totally predictable, so the movie is to be recommended for its original approach to genre, visual beauty and effectively managed dramatic violence."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),Your average Western- and then some,"This movie mixes old fashioned western with sci-fi, with horrir, to produce an unforgetable movie. Or at least a movie with sine very unforgetable scenes. The beauty of this movie, is that it is done so well, one never suspends disbelief. I gained an new appreciation for Kurt Russell,who started as a Disney Golden boy, and has shown his great range of absolutely believable characters, in any genre or mix of genre (including a super cool Santa Claus) Richard Jenkins and David Arquette also add their experience and talent to the mix, making this movie, I think, much better than it could have been. A bit more gore than i like, but still a good, original story, with a good cast who all played their parts well."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),It's a nice slow burn kind of movie,This movie feels like som Western guys for an normal Western movie who get integledd into something that is Beyond there comprehenson What is happening. It's a nice slow burn kind of movie with some disgusting horrible body Harvard that just slowly begin to come to the surface and when you realize what is really horribley bad. All of the performances were good that weren't any ones I felt were bad and especially the guy who leg was broken did an amazing job fighting through it and oh my god it looked disgusting. The body horror was horrific and good and my god. It was disgusting so it did job amazingly and the characters were so great and grey at the same type. It didn't really feel like there were any good guys. Just guys who lived in the middle West in the 1890s. Amazingly done movie and amazing first movie for that director will 100% recommend it.
Bone Tomahawk (2015),Solid film,"When I first saw it, I was quite disappointed. I expected a more interesting character to be played by Kurt Russel. Also, I thought the plot was dull and the gore was needlessly intense. On second viewing, I still think they went too far with the gore, but not way too far. That element is necessary for the adversaries to come across as truly menacing. However, I think the screenplay is not as bad as I thought on first viewing. It's pretty decent. I do think Kurt Russel should have had a more prominent role and given more to do, and I also think that the film lacks more action. The slow pacing is ok as such, but there is not enough stuff going on for it to work entirely. Either make characters more complex and work on their relationships, or, if you want to avoid that, focus more on action. This screenplay could have used some polishing. One more point: the climax was somewhat weak for me. Overall, it's still a good film."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),Western Bine Tomahawk,"As a cinephile, venturing into the realm of cinema that fuses distinct genres such as Western and horror is genuinely a thrill like no other. There's one particular gem that stands out, and it is, without a doubt, impossible to forget once you've watched: S. Craig Zahler's ""Bone Tomahawk."" It is the perfect amalgamation of suspense, violence, and fear, a gritty, grinding ride through American Western landscapes infused with a shudderingly real mix of horror. To truly appreciate this rare blend of horror and western, watch Bone Tomahawk and prepare for an unforgettable ride. It all begins with an enigmatic drifter, Purvis (played by David Arquette), touching the sacred burial ground of the ""Troglodytes,"" a group of brutal, cannibalistic cave dwellers. The story spins into motion when these horrifying creatures abduct the wife of a disabled rancher. The rancher, named Arthur (played by Patrick Wilson), despite his injured leg, insists on being part of the rescue party. Completing the party are the town's sheriff (Kurt Russell), his old deputy (Richard Jenkins), and a flashy gunslinger (Matthew Fox)."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),West meets horror,". The worst horror mutalations in the west. Well done script and story execution by S. Craig Zahler. Although, Tarantino influenced dialogue and revenge scenarios. Yet it's a serious western drama. Eclectic conversations and unusual characters, like Broody played by Mathew Fox. Great acting and cinematography. The writing and directing by s.craig zahler is subtle and original. They have resilience over challenge of the grotesque troglodites. Like zombies they are diminished to creatures who are cannibals even the indian tribes fear them as unevolved spiecies. The sheriff played by Kurt Russell is a strong presence as he usually adds charisma and strength of character to his roles. Patrick Wilson and Richard Jenkins as supporting cast are also talented . A sweet and sour sad capitulation."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),"Someone termed this ""torture porn"" and it's 💯 accurate","I'm giving it one extra star because the movie itself--aside from the HORRIBLY DISTURBING gore-- was actually pretty well-done and interesting. I really wondered why they had to ruin the darn thing by showing some of the most disturbing Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style mutilation scenes I've ever had the displeasure of watching. I don't think I'm revealing spoilers here because I believe it's clear from ALL the other reviews that this is part gore-horror flick, but I really feel strongly that people should be forewarned in non-spoiler reviews that you need to REALLY be okay with human mutilation (as stated by that other reviewer: ""torture porn"") to actually like this film. Again, too bad -- because I actually thought the quiet dialogue, lack of soundtrack, kind of ""ordinary"" (vs. Overly dramatic) depiction of the story was pretty interesting. I liked the characters and thought they did a good job of developing them. I was rooting for them. I would have to say the woman who gets captured is a pretty dull, flat actor (someone else mentioned how dry her delivery of her lines was, when she should have been expressing sheer terror at certain points) -- but other than that the other actors were pretty good. It was just so disappointing when the film took a horrifying turn and all of a sudden I am feeling just as nauseous as I did when watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original) decades ago. It's a dull, aching nausea kind of feeling, like... are there really other humans who are that depraved in our world? I don't want to know, honestly. Or at least I don't want to SEE it laid out before my eyes. UGH. By the way, I really can stand gore for the most part, especially if it serves the story effectively (like in a war movie) -- it is just this gratuitous, almost gleefully gory hell-like stuff that turns my stomach. So if that's you too: you've been warned!"
Bone Tomahawk (2015),"Very slow, but worthwhile if you're patient","When a cannibalistic tribe kidnap some settlers from the small town of Bright Hope (one of which is the town's doctor) a small team which includes the sheriff and his deputy set out on a rescue mission. However, it seems that our intrepid rescuers may have underestimated their primitive foes and aren't entirely prepared for the danger that they may face... Bone Tomahawk has the feel of an old-fashioned western; it's sprawling in nature, lots of camp fire style chats and a decent build up to what would ultimately become a fairly impressive albeit brutal and at times tough to watch finale. Ultimately it has some good qualities, but it also has its fair share of weaknesses. One notable weakness lies with the characters; they're just not all that engaging or compelling as people and whilst lots of dialogue is exchanged between the characters much of it is not all that interesting. A more obvious problem is the length of the film and the general lack of incident for much of its run time - I'm all for slow burn, but Bone Tomahawk really stretches that term almost to breaking point. On the plus side, the picture is well-made and the old-fashioned feel to it is intended as a compliment. The actors are all good; Jenkins, Wilson, Fox, Simmons & Russell all do a very solid job with what can arguably be described as 'underwritten characters.' Ultimately Bone Tomahawk is just about worth the effort, but it's fair to say that you'll need to be patient as not a great deal happens until past the hour mark. If patience is not one of your virtues or if you prefer your Westerns to contain more in the way of incident, humour, or entertainment, then you may want to look elsewhere."
Bone Tomahawk (2015),Strong entry in an under-appreciated genre,"Not enough Western horror out there. Bone Tomahawk is proof there should be more. Great performances, snappy dialogue, brutal kills. The plot isn't exactly full of twists and turns, but events didn't totally play out like I expected them to. The movie does end a little abruptly, and I would have liked more answers on where these Native Americans came from, their culture, etc. I think this is one of the few films that would have benefitted from an additional half hour or so to give time for events to fully wrap up. As-is, we're still left with some questions that I think would have been better if answered. Still a solid film and a solid recommend."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),"A powerful film, less about character and more about theme!","This isn't so much a film with a driven story or narrative, but more a brooding introspection on American manifest destiny and greed. I'll always remember the first time I saw Dances With Wolves, in particular the scene where they encounter the buffalo killed only for their hides. Butcher's Crossing essentially takes that scene and runs with it. While Cage plays a singular character, he's more an embodiment of a particular point in American history; brutal and bloody but ultimately fleeting and pointless. It's a powerful performance from him, not over the top or off the wall as he often can be, but quiet, introspective and with a malice and rage burning below the surface. It could be said that the central characters lacked a defining narrative but that's not hugely important here. I think this film was much more about mood and capturing the futility of exploiting a commodity until there is nothing left, not because it must be done but simply because it can be done. Some stunning cinematography and an important theme make Butcher's Crossing well worth a watch and it most certainly deserves more than the 5.7 out of 10 it's currently getting on IMDB!"
Butcher's Crossing (2022),Grant's Policy Missed,"Especially through the credits at the end, President Grant's Policy to starve the Indian Problem by ordering the slaughter of the Buffalo was missed, not even a mention which makes the movie pointless in my opinion. Otherwise the cinematography is wonderful and the main characters are believable. There is no reference to why Buffalo hides are in demand though and that's because demand was a government imagined one to starve Native Americans and pay for so doing. It was a regretful policy that even before his death, Grant regretted it's success. It's too bad that isn't explained. Never be the same."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),Into the Heart of Darkness,"The end credits of Butcher's Crossing inform us that the American bison population was hunted down from 60 million in 1860, to fewer than 300 by 1880. Madness. This film is a visually-stunning, impeccably-acted, slow-burn descent into madness. I do love a good cinematic descent into madness, as evidenced by my adoration for the films of Werner Herzog. I couldn't help but notice Herzog's name listed amongst the 100+ names in the ""Special Thanks"" section of the credits; he was surely an inspiration on this one. I also adore Nicolas Cage, who again demonstrates his incredible talent and range as a actor in a role that calls for him to lose his mind, but not to go over-the top with it. It's a mesmerizing performance, reminiscent in a way of Klaus Kinski in ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"", if I may extend the Herzog comparisons. Earlier this year, ""The Old Way"" was noted as Nicolas Cage's first Western, but Butcher's Crossing came out before that on the festival circuit, and now that I've finally had a chance to see it, it's most definitely a Western, and a much less clichéd, more artful one too. Nicolas Cage's real first Western is one that I wouldn't hesitate to rank as one of the top Western films of the 21st century. This may be a difficult film to watch for some people, given the mass slaughter and butchering of buffalo depicted in the film, which all looks perfectly real. While this film does not feature the boilerplate ""No animals were harmed"" disclaimer in the end credits, it is noted that all buffalo were handled by the Blackfeet Tribe Buffalo Program, an admirable Native-run conservation group that invited the filmmakers onto their land to tell this story. While I'm sort of assuming we aren't actually watching buffalo be killed, it is clear that the Blackfeet Tribe hunt a small number of animals each year in the sustainable way of their ancestors, and presumably some of the scenes of animals being skinned are real. I would love to know more about how some of these scenes were achieved, because some of it is quite grim. Nonetheless, this is a movie I would recommend to animal lovers, given its portrayal of the evil of the buffalo hunt, and its admirable conservationist messaging."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),The Last Hunt,"After all those decades of crap of all kinds, Nicholas Cage, Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, seems to be back, and in great shape. Among all those craps, there were somewhere some good ones though. That said, this plot is obviously a tribute - at least for me who is a movie buff - to Richard Brook's THE LAST HUNT and - or - Jack Lee Thompson's THE WHITE BUFFALO, but Nick Cage is not Robert Taylor - THE LAST HUNT, and the plot a bit weaker too than Brook's masterpiece. Anyway, this film can easily be considered as a tremendous buffalo hunt movie; I don't think there were so many in western history. And a good western is so rare in those days. Such a kind of plot could have been made in the early seventies, during the gloomy, melancholical period of the movie industry. All this for nothing.... The scheme of the naive tenderfoot finding out the gritty, rough life in the wilderness, the lanscape, is very well done here."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),"Not great, not bad","I wanted to give a higher rate but it's hard because the movie has many issues. That being said, it's not a bad movie, very watchable especially if you love westerns. The actors performances are good, the story and plot are decent. Probably lacks more action. You won't see many bullets. My biggest issue, and maybe this is a ""me problem"", is their clothing. I see this problem many times in modern low budget westerns. The people in charge of the outfits, wardrobes and characters design should put a bigger effort in making the audience feel the old western days, teleporting the audience back in time. Instead, I feel they are wearing Levi's jeans and gap shirts, all clean. The horses are also way too clean. Anyway, it's not that big of a deal, just wanted to share my point of view. Cheers."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),You got to get the herd leader,"Will Andrews (Fred Hechinger) quits Harvard and travels to Kansas in 1874. He meets up with a man named McDonald (Paul Raci) who is acquainted with his father. McDonald is too busy for Will who wants to go on a buffalo hunt to see our country. At the saloon, he finds Miller (Nicolas Cage) who is a buffalo hunter. Will asks to come along, but the local herds are too thin. He knows where there is a great herd in Indian County in Colorado. He needs money for the trip, which is about all Will happens to have. He hires a skinner and a camp man as they set out in late fall, a bad time to go, so close to winter. This is a Nicolas Cage film I will soon forget. It was all about the futility of hunting buffalo as we see by the ending. There is not a lot of action and it is mostly men talking and the dialogue and actors couldn't carry the film. Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),Worst movie I've seen in 60 YEARS! Worst than worst.,"The absolute worst movie ever. I saw ""western"" and thought ""oh yeah"" and followed it up by paying $20 to rent this ridiculously disgusting, stupid, bad plot and wrong actor choices movie. I would rather have had an ingrown toe nail pulled by a gorilla than watch this garbage. I assured my husband it will be great. He did Con Air. Not all his movies are awful! This was undeniably a waste of time and money, not to mention awful. I should have gone outside to clean up dog poop instead! Why, you ask, is this so bad? The portrayal of cowboys being so stupid as to get stuck in a blizzard for up to 8 months with only one way out. Seasoned cowboys would have KNOWN BETTER! Nicholas Cage pretending to be a tough guy is the equivalent of Pee Wee Herman being a tough guy. Neither are believable and you lose respect for the actor, producer and director. It was slow and boring. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY OR BRAIN CELLS ON THIS GARBAGE. GO SHOVEL DOG POOP. FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),Better than expected,"I didn't really expect to like this film all that much. Sometimes in that situation you turn out to be right, sometimes you turn out to be pleasantly surprised. 'Butcher's Crossing' fell somewhere in the middle. I certainly enjoyed it more than I expected to, let's just say that. The casting of Nicolas Cage is an interesting one. On the one hand, I didn't feel he was overly suited to the role. On the other hand, I felt his charisma brought a lot to the movie. And in a movie that is pretty desolate and grim, having a character/actor that you can enjoy and feel some familiarity with can go a long way. I found myself a lot more interested in the story line than I expected. Generally old-time westerns do absolutely nothing for me. But the story here, simple as it was, kept me entertained and wanting to know what was around the next corner. 6.5/10."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),"Sadly, this is not what I intended to see, after all the excitement.","Will Andrews (Fred Hechinger) is desperate to experience the wild west and some buffalo hunting. After being refused to be taken on the wild ride by his father's friend, he is lured into by Miller (Nicolas Cage), who had once witnessed a big herd of buffaloes and wants to get his hand on the hunt. Thus, the wild west journey begins with Will funding the whole hunting expedition. Amidst the harsh experience of the journey itself, the greed takes over and the following madness makes the group numb towards the cruelty they display. What happens to the Miller's crew, Miller's greed and Will's excitement to experience the wild west forms rest of the story. Butcher's Crossing is an ambitious film, wanting to focus on the physical and emotional rollercoaster this group go through during their buffalo hunt. It is not a easy ride and they get stranded during their wild hunt. The film throws scene after scene, depicting their time on the desert and during the hunt. The problem was it failing to register the impact. We barely get to know the characters and their motives, probably with the exception of Will Andrews. This makes it hard to connect with these characters and their hardships. Not that the performances are bad. Infact it is what that carries the film till the end. Yet, it doesn't stop feeling like a missed opportunity as the intent was to explore the human emotion and the effect the brutal killings to even the fellow men's death have on them while battling the toll the entire expedition has on their physical and mental health. The narrative only scrapes through these emotions instead of exploring it a bit deeper. I did like the ending twist when they return back, I wish the build up to the climax had paid off better."
Butcher's Crossing (2022),"Disgusting, it's the point","It appears people are vote bombing because they don't like seeing guts, gore, and buffalo getting killed. Buffalo co-evolved with American Indians for thousands of years as a hunted animal. They were hunted sustainably and revered. Nobody is endorsing the killing of buffalo to this extent; that is the point of the movie to show the atrocities by Americans in the 1800s. If you are disgusted, the film has done its job. I thought the supporting cast was a little weak but the writing was on point. Beautifully shot, Nicolas Cage hits a home run for his character (perfectly casted by the way), and a wonderful conclusion. This one is worth a watch."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Watchable but Flawed,"A relative of mine recommended this film, and while I do not greatly respect his opinion of movies, I gave this one a shot because it had a high ranking on this site and was available on an IPTV service that I was already subscribed to. My first thought about the movie as it begins is that it has the look and sound of a Taylor Sheridan film, which is not a bad thing, as I found many episodes of Yellowstone riveting. The leads in HOHW, (Chris Pine and Ben Foster), playing brothers with very different personalities, perform well enough, with credible western accents and the obligatory good-natured insulting of each other. You also see this in the exchanges between Sheriff Hamilton, played by Jeff Bridges, and his deputy, Alberto played by Yellowstone actor Gil Birmingham. Sometimes the insults are humorous; other times they seem too bigoted for my liking. Nonetheless, the scenes with Bridges and Birmingham are the only ones that make the movie enjoyable for me and are the only reason I am giving this film a rating higher than 3. In the scene where the sheriff is investigating the robbery of one of the banks, he amusingly walks through a gaping hole in the wall where the windows were shot out. There was a missed opportunity for Bridges to make a humorous wisecrack here. The biggest problem with this movie is the far-fetched plot. It challenges credulity to accept that the brothers would go on a Bonnie&Clyde-style bank-robbing spree to avenge the foreclosing of their mother's ranch (and thereby retain possession of it by paying off the mortgage and back taxes with money stolen from the bank), rather than, as another wise reviewer pointed out, simply hire a competent estate attorney to resolve the matter. That shouldn't be difficult, especially since the property in question contains valuable crude oil reserves. I get that the crazy ex-con brother might be up to the insane plan just for the thrill, but why would the more even-tempered brother want to do it? Even more difficult to understand is that it was the quiet brother's idea in the first place-the one with two sons who he hopes will have better lives than those of their loser father and uncle. Theft and murder do not seem like promising ways to ensure a bright future for your young'uns. Makes no sense. To top it all off, there is an obvious attempt to make the two brothers sympathetic characters. And notwithstanding the final scene with Pine and Bridges, where the sheriff points out that Toby is as guilty as Tanner, this attempt to make the ""evil bank"" a justification for robbery and murder rubbed me the wrong way. A nice soundtrack and titillating western vistas are pluses. A final thought: you can always recognize Taylor Sheridan in a cameo--he is the guy who rides a horse well but can't act a lick. LOL. A final, final thought: I wonder if the writer knows that pigs do not need their sense of sight to locate truffles."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),A great third act,"This movie, about Toby who is a divorced father who's trying to make a better life, is a good crime movie! It has good actors, cinematography and score, and it's visually appealing all the way. The main drawback to me is the pace in the first and second act. Despite that the movie contains some interesting dialogues, it's extremely slow. I have never seen a movie with more scenes with characters looking at the horizon and having a chat, which feels like it escapes from the main plot, and therefore it gets a little boring and dull. However, the third act redeems most of it because of the great action, suspense and dialogues that end the movie in a great way. Despite its slow pace and extended dialogues in the first and second acts, this movie delivers an exhilarating and satisfying conclusion, redeeming its shortcomings and delivering a memorable crime drama."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),"Texas Lethal Weapon meets Dark, Gritty Butch and Sundance","Hell or High water is the perfect example of what a modern, contemporary Western should look like. It has similar tropes you want in a western as well as adding new flare and ideas of the new film to spice it up. Taylor Sheridan continues to write some of my favorite screenplays. He gets what people want to see in a film and his plots are always crazy and this one fits right in. The acting is phenomenal! You have a buddy cop duo of an old Texas ranger(Jeff Bridges) and his Native American partner(the lethal weapon similarity). You also have a buddy Robbers duo with Chris Pine and Ben Foster that reminded me a lot of Butch and Sundance if it was in modern Texas and had a dark comedy and gritty edge to them. That combo of the two duos creates the greatest game of cops and robbers ever that once you finish it is so intensely satisfying. Bridges, Pine, and Foster give an acting clinic in this and major shoutout to Bridges who even in his later age had so much swagger and BA Attitude in this Movie. Taylor Sheridan, the director, and cast did westerns and Texas a honor with this one! A must watch if Outlaw, Dark, Westerns are your thing. 9/10 one of the best of the decade."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Gorgeous movie and iconic,"Top-tier cinematography, smooth acting, tuned aesthetics and a feeling of nothing being out of place is the hallmark of an amazing team behind this production. As far as ideas go, I can't say it's the most unique setting, plot or dialogue, though it was definitely a stroke of genius to give a solid action sequence with real casualties; I am glad they didn't hold back any punches. In this case the high appraisal of this film I'd say is warranted, as they did an excellent job. While it's certainly polished, to give minor criticism I'd say it lacks a more diverse creativity, and the whole native American stigma persisting in the age of smartphones seems unlikely. But it was worth watching, and overall quite enjoyable."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Just missing some Banjo playing to make it truly appalling,"Jeff Bridges phoned in one of his worst 2-dimensional performances yet - and as Pine was little help in contributing a believable performance, this movie just limped from one predictable scene to the next. Maybe it could have worked as a TV special - restricted to southern state Cable channels only. But as entertainment to the rest of the thinking World, this was dire. It was a shame as many of the supporting cast did at least try to contribute some dedication to their Art - and obviously wanted to assist a weak script to a decent conclusion, but they were left with few chances other than pedestrian and predictable exchanges. Will give some kudos to some capable Directing - but that's about it."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),"""slow down!"" ""I ain't speeding""","This is really a study in characters and in character. We open with a small town bank robbery, but most of the film is spent learning about the two brothers who perpetrated the crime, the two rangers assigned the case, and the small towns and broke communities where the action takes place. One brother is quiet and careful, the other won't be reined in, the rangers are patient but in the dark, and the townspeople are not afraid to obstruct the law or to shoot a suspect. As the movie goes on we learn more about the backstory and the moral standpoint of the brothers. The result is a movie that keeps you guessing, and beginning to dread the inevitable climax, as you care too much about all the characters to see any of them get hurt."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),An important neo-western,"""Hell or High Water"" is an incredibly beautiful neo-western about two brothers who decide to commit several robberies in order to buy back their family ranch, where, by a happy coincidence, a source of oil had been discovered. Two old-school Texas Rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) give chase. Dusty orange landscapes, roadside diners, plaid shirts and bullet shots - welcome to the new wild west. In the era of credit cards, online loans and virtual accounts, there is no one to steal money from other than banks (especially in Texas, where everyone has a gun under their shirts). The problem is that you will have to spend it in the same bank to pay off your loans. Blue-eyed Toby (Chris Pine) decides to take an adventure in order to break the vicious cycle of poverty and provide his sons with a bright and carefree future. His brother Tanner (Ben Foster) helps purely for fun. After all, of the two of them, he is a skilled criminal with many years of experience, recently released from prison and eager for new adventures. And so begins the fascinating rat race from the loan desk to the cash desk. British director McKenzie very naturally conveys the life of the unwashed American outback. He looks at it not with nostalgia, but rather with pity. The winds of change do not reach here: cowboy hats, cow-drivers on horseback and even the sharp racist jokes from the mouth of the sheriff - all this seems like dusty relics of the past. This is a dead land, where there is no place to live, and the only working mechanisms are bank branches and pumping stations that pump oil. McKenzie turns a story that is simple at first glance into a real social drama, ideologically similar to ""Big Short"". In addition, the director creates a magnificent cinematic spectacle, adding a pinch of bromance, thriller, action and mixing everything with first-class humor. Don't forget the masterful cinematography and mind-blowing shots that look like the brightly filtered views from True Detective, and the so we have one of the best films of 2016."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Beautiful to watch even in an Endless Loop,"Endlessly watchable in an endless loop. Two brothers who rob banks in the US south. Seriously: What's not to love ? Top acting talent throughout, witty dialogues, and several odd twists. Also, if you look for a smart western but you never find them 100% convincing - then watch this hidden gem. In general, movies about financial crime are underrated and rare, because hardly any writer ever wants to explore that complex area. But really, banks put ATMs and cashiers everywhere. Because every spot seems to be policed. It's so beautiful to watch the two brothers outsmart Jeff Bridges playing a ranger."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Decent,"Okay, a little odd an entry in my high rated movies I've seen this year. Worth a watch though. A little overrated by some and underrated by others. I can fully understand why this was mostly popular by males. The accents are a little thick, sometimes getting in the way of what could have been better, the at times slow and really quite boring. Though the movie is a little cheesy all round with some basic acting other times it's very well executed acting and thrilling. Your wanting the two brothers to do well but also annoyed slightly that just because times are tough in the real world you know what they were doing was wrong. To me this is what the movie will bring, confusion in what's right and what's wrong. Victims of a modern day life victims of the system in a way, but also motivated to fulfill their goals and raise enough without hopefully paying the price of a life behind bars. The police are lacklustre here, so much so it's laughable even in the final third. There's no way had this been another area they'd have gotten away with any of this. Texas tends to be a bit backwards but even so the script was a little too thin. All in all though a really good thrilling movie if you haven't got high standards."
Hell or High Water (II) (2016),Fantastic!,"I first watched this without realising that it was another Taylor Sheridan film. 😳It was only when I watched the credits that I saw his name pop up and I immediately watched it for a second time. No spoilers here. This is the story of two brothers who face having their recently deceased mothers homestead repossessed by the bank. Chris Pine's character wants to ensure the property remains in the family for his sons to inherit (oil has recently been discovered on it) but they don't have the money to cover what the bank says they owe. Solution, Rob the same chain of banks that want to foreclose on the homestead to get the money to pay off the bank!!! Brilliant! Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham play a couple of Texas Rangers who are hot on the heels of our bank robbers! Bridges easily steals every scene he is in as expected and this is one of his best characters in years! The story unfolds at a good pace with the beautiful Texas scenery on full display. The casting is spot on and you end up rooting for the good guys - we all hate foreclosing bankers right? A great story and highly recommended. 👍"
Unforgiven (1992),"""It's a hell of a thing killing a man......""","A brilliant work, brooding and dark, with slow pacing, excellent casting and acting and superb attention to production design and detail. The film in some ways lives up to the genre of the western with rugged, characters, raw masculinity, beautiful stark cinematography of plains, mountains and the unspoilt beauty of the mid West. Gene Hackman's little Bill is a man who projects raw power and toughness, he's so macho that he even builds his own house too. A man who likes to get his hands dirty then. Unforigven though is also a deconstruction of the western genre, with it's tropes, folklore and hearsay. The character English Bob serves not only as a warning of what can happen to unwelcome visitors to the town, he's also a character whose mystery and grandeur is gradually pulled away until a more humble character is left behind. The realism extends down to the weaponry the characters use, bullets often miss their mark & guns are prone to jam. There's lots of character development but the story is almost the opposite of a redemption story. The plot isn't based around personal revenge or anything like that either for our 3 killers, they're doing it for the money and that's it. Clint Eastwood's characters instance that he'll be able to carry out his mission without reverting back to his nasty old self is very much thrown into doubt. The film in the end is about brutality and the horrific effect violence takes on the human life. On the technical side the film is superbly shot and directed. Sound design is superb and dialogue is clear and stands apart from the score. Much of the film takes place in dark interiors reflecting the reality of life back then, there were no 40 watt light bulbs in the evening. Daylight scenes are clear though and add a harsh reality to the landscape. I own the UHD Blu Ray 2160p and was really impressed with the high quality picture and sound. Only flaw is the Eastwood character suddenly developing this plot armour at the end of the movie which really spoils the realism they were going for up to that point. As others have pointed out too this is hardly the first revisionist western either."
Unforgiven (1992),Emtpy,"This movie, about Retired Old West gunslinger William Munny who reluctantly takes on one last job, is a weak western movie. The visuals, like the costumes, props and sets catch your attention, and the movie immediately gives you that western feeling. The first half was slow, but still interesting. Slowness in the first half of movies are quite common, so therefore I had a certain level of expectation for the rest of the movie. However, I got disappointed. It felt like the movie mostly contained unnecessary scenes. One scene really stood out, which was Bill's bluff, but otherwise, there was barely any engagement. The character development was also rushed and poor, and I almost didn't get stressed for one minute during the scenes that were supposed to feel stressful. The editing was weird, as well. The dialogues were sometimes okay, but also kind of boring. The characters were talking about what they were going to do, which was basically the main plot of the movie, but things barely happened. And when there was some sort of action, those scenes didn't really speak to me. So overall, the movie feels empty, to be honest. This movie, while visually appealing and initially engaging, ultimately falls short in its narrative execution. The slow first half, while expected, fails to deliver in the latter half, leaving with a sense of emptiness. The unnecessary scenes, rushed character development, and underwhelming action sequences fail to captivate the viewer, leaving the movie feeling incomplete. The dialogues, while occasionally decent, lack the depth and impact necessary to elevate the story. Overall, the movie's lack of substance and engagement makes it a forgettable Western experience."
Unforgiven (1992),Genre Deconstruction Done Right,"Through no fault of its own Unforgiven is partly responsible for the trite, ongoing trend of Hollywood deconstruction in which genre movies are presumed to be deep and subversive if they eschew morality for nihilism and turn the heroes into villains and vice-versa. Unforgiven is a good deal smarter and more nuanced than that. There are no heroes or innocents, but nor are there any real villains. The characters are self-deluded to varying degrees but they aren't nihilists. Instead the script suggests that moral righteousness is largely a matter of circumstance and perspective. Unforgiven is also a good deal more than just an exercise in deconstructing the tropes of the classic Hollywood Western. It's a tightly-scripted, deliberately-paced and entertaining movie featuring a quintet of excellent performers at the top of their respective games."
Unforgiven (1992),Eastwood has created one of the greatest westerns produced in the last 30 years.,"Without a doubt. Perhaps even a classic of this genre, already so well-stocked across the Atlantic, an edifice to which he has already contributed a lot. With its haunting and tortuous atmosphere, depicted wonderfully by dark photography which plays heavily on chiaroscuro, as well as contemplative shots of the rocky hills burned by the sun contrasting with the twilight falling on the arid plains (we also feel that the actor-director-producer learned well at the Leone school), and his characters of men who are nevertheless without fear or weakness in appearance but so tormented in their flesh, embodied wonderfully by a lineup of fabulous actors in tune (Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and of course Clint himself). Unforgiven therefore has all the criteria to be included among this. As bitter as it is captivating, this fable of the West, told like a legend in which the greatest outlaws wanted to be included at all costs, filmed with class and sobriety the quest for redemption through weapons and violence of a man who can no longer escape what he really is... So, cowboys don't always hide and cry! Fans of the genre will undoubtedly appreciate what presents itself as the best western that Eastwood has directed in his long and flamboyant filmography. As merciless as it is inescapable. 10/10."
Unforgiven (1992),"We All Have It Comin', Kid.","From the opening guitar, to the closing guitar, this movie is a masterpiece. My personal favorite Western of All Time, narrowly passing The Good The Bad and The Ugly for the best in that category in my opinion. Award worthy performances from Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Winner Gene Hackman round out this classic Western. Also with the legendary Richard Harris. Eastwood graduated into the elite ranks of directors with this one, capturing the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director in 1993. And it was well deserved. And thanks to Alberta, Canada for letting it be filmed there! 10/10."
Unforgiven (1992),Slow-Moving Revisionist Western as Eastwood Revels in the Violence of his One-Dimensional Characters,"""Unforgiven"" falls into the category of revisionist Westerns, aiming to offer a more realistic and intricate portrayal of the American West, in stark contrast to the previous romanticized and fictional depictions of the frontier. However, the revisionist approach, while attempting to reflect reality, occasionally tips the scales by overemphasizing violence and exaggerating elements for the sake of storytelling. This inclination to depict the West as excessively violent may not necessarily mirror the everyday experiences of the majority of individuals living in that time and place, where life revolved around survival, farming, ranching, and community building. In the setting of ""Unforgiven,"" the 1880 small town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, hardly harbors a virtuous soul. One-dimensional characters populate the narrative, and the only women featured are prostitutes. The plot is propelled by an incident involving these women. Two cowboys visit the brothel, and one of them gruesomely disfigures a prostitute with a knife. In an unlikely twist, the prostitutes pool their savings and put out the word that they seek a contract killer to exact revenge on the cowboys. They hire The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young braggart who claims to have killed five men, though it's questionable. He then seeks out the central character, reformed killer William Munny, played by Clint Eastwood, a man with a criminal past who miraculously remains a free man. Will Munny, however, obsessively fixates on his late wife's positive influence throughout the film, turning his reminiscing into an annoying and distracting narrative element. With his farm facing financial struggles and two young children to care for, he agrees to the Schofield Kid's offer, yet leaves his kids to fend for themselves while he embarks on this perilous journey. Munny reconnects with his former partner in crime, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), but it's somewhat puzzling that screenwriter David Webb Peoples doesn't explore racial dynamics in Ned's character, considering he's a black man in the 19th century. The film's antagonist, Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett (Gene Hackman), stands in stark contrast to Munny with his sadistic tendencies. Little Bill brutally beats the chauvinistic English Bob (Richard Harris), a troublemaker previously employed by the railroads. While Harris delivers a commendable performance, his character isn't seamlessly integrated into the plot, existing primarily to illustrate Little Bill's proclivity for violence. English Bob also serves up a source of comic relief through his hired novelist, W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), who ends up working for Little Bill and transcribing his memoirs. The unrelenting violence takes center stage, with Munny eventually confronting Little Bill after he tortures and kills Ned. It's worth mentioning that Munny fulfills the contract by killing the two cowboys, a choice that turns him into an unlikable vigilante, although screenwriter Peoples doesn't seem to see it that way. ""Unforgiven"" might not be as problematic if it weren't for its ponderous editing, which results in an exceedingly slow-paced narrative. Clint Eastwood, who also directed the film, shoulders much of the responsibility for its glacial pacing. The performances in ""Unforgiven"" are hindered by the one-dimensional characters, with Eastwood delivering a somewhat monotonous performance. Hackman fares slightly better as the unlikable, sadistic sheriff, while Harris manages to inject some charm into his character, despite being drawn into the vortex of gratuitous violence."
Unforgiven (1992),Decent film!,"Unforgiven is a decent film! What works: A story about what is called the horror's gold. Because of a violent action mixed with misdirected justice when little Bill make a finical penalty for a human crime set Little Bill too his own death. Revenge and justice is a theme in the Unforgiven. What works Eastwood portrays a violent man redeemed who is own a quest for money which turns personal. Best role of Hackman as an effective sheriff for violent time were anything can happen 13 minutes away from town. Hackman was good at using fear, and violence which was great dealing with English Bob, but finally goes one too many with the wrong guy Eastwood. Well casted directed with some old age humor with Eastwood makes a good dark movie with a few slow spots. 7 stars."
Unforgiven (1992),Unforgiven,"Clint Eastwood for me is normally the guy in Westerns that can take out 10 guys with one revolver. Here he is a shadow of that guy. He's trying to go straight, full of regret also he can't shoot straight, He struggles to ride a Horse, Gets ill easily and you think he's never going to get there and when he finally becomes the typical Clint Eastwood, he's the scariest he's ever been. A prostitute is cut up by a Cowboy and the sheriff played brilliantly by Gene Hackman sort of lets them get away with it, so the other prostitutes band together to get a reward for killing the man. It's the journey that is great."
Unforgiven (1992),"Clint Eastwood succeeds through simplicity and efficiency, create moments that deconstruct the western myths and those that make a beautiful tribute to the western genre","Conducting the narrative safely and without many flourishes, Clint Eastwood succeeds through the simplicity and efficiency of his direction, moving with elegance between the moments that deconstruct the western myths and those that make a beautiful tribute to the genre. Written by David Webb Peoples, ""Unforgivable"" presents delicious dialogues that are consistent with the universe of those characters, opening space for moments of comic relief in the conversations between Munny and Ned (highlight for Ned's curiosity to know how Munny makes up for the lack of sex after his wife's death), reinforced by Munny's difficulty mounting and Kid's aimless shooting (""You shot all creation,"" complains Ned). Obviously, the empathy between Freeman and Eastwood collaborates a lot and makes that friendship believable, as we can see, for example, in the conversation by the fire about what Ned misses, which still indicates that Kid is lying, saying, without much conviction, who has already killed 5 men (and here it is worth highlighting Woolvett's performance, conveying this feeling of insecurity through his unconvincing speech). But the main theme of the film is the deconstruction of several western clichés and myths, in addition to the constant ""flirting"" with death and the certainty that it is not easy to take someone's life. Basically, the film preaches that pulling the trigger is not for everyone, so men with the necessary coldness at this moment become legends and are rarities (something that will also be reflected in the sensational climax of the narrative). Of course, there are also legends created at random, romanticized by those who tell the story and allow themselves ""some creative freedom"", as the writer Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) says. Better than anyone else, he represents Hollywood's glamorized vision of the western that Eastwood wants to deconstruct. For Clint, life in the wild west wasn't all that pretty. Beautifully photographed by Jack N. Green, Unforgiven is, in its look, a Western with a capital F. Even deconstructing several western concepts, Eastwood does not forget to place his ""heroes"" riding in the distance, with only their silhouettes appearing. This is just one of many scenes capriciously captured by Jack N. Green's photography, which accurately captures the beautiful landscapes, with many scenes under the sunset and even under the rain (which reinforces the melancholy of the narrative). . In addition, the various night scenes, always lit with candles and lamps, have a beautiful look, quite dark and consistent with the bitterness of those characters. Also worthy of praise is the art direction team, which builds an impeccable Old West town through the precise architecture of the town of ""Big Whiskey"", reinforced by Janice Blackie-Goodine's costumes, which follow the western pattern with the boots, leather and hats (with emphasis on the striking Eastwood hat, which harks back to the spaghetti western days). The beautiful soundtrack by Lennie Niehaus is unforgettable, with its delicate and nostalgic theme song undergoing some variations that illustrate the feelings of the characters, such as when William, after being beaten by Bill, thinks he is going to die and shows regret for everything he has done (and in both scenes, the look carried by the shadows conveys the character's distress). The good sound work is noticeable not only in the remarkable shots and thunder, but also through subtle noises, such as the sound of the trigger being pulled or the crickets in the field, and the delicious rhythm of the feature is a merit of Joel Cox's editing, which intersperses contemplative moments in front of beautiful landscapes and moments of high tension. In addition, it makes elegant transitions, such as when Munny wakes up and discovers that he has been sick for 3 days or when a prostitute says that ""the rain is coming"", also announcing the arrival of Munny, Ned and Kid, who were galloping in the rain minutes before. All this excellent technical work serves as support for the excellent cast of ""Unforgiven"" to build, under the direction of the competent Eastwood, bitter and complex characters. Starting with one of the legends of the west, played by the always charismatic Richard Harris. Closely accompanied by the curious writer Beauchamp, Bob ""English"" is the typical outlaw who made fame in the West, but the way things happen deconstructs this image of the ""myth"" before the writer and the spectator, especially when Bill tells the true story of Corky's murder ""Two Guns"". The legends are being created based on exaggerations, as when Kid says that the man cut off the eyes, ears and breasts of the prostitute, which leads the Kid himself to doubt that Munny could be beaten by Bill, claiming that his gun ""probably "" it locked. Gene Hackman, on the other hand, composes a cruel and ruthless Little Bill, capable of kicking a dangerous thug out of the city, delivering a loaded gun into the hands of a prisoner and beating a captured killer to death. On the other hand, he shows pity when he catches the man who cut up a prostitute (""They're just cowboys who screwed up"") and at various times he seems to just want to live in peace in his new home - and Hackman is very competent in oscillating between moments of fury and the character's moments of serenity accurately. It is also worth mentioning his exceptional performance in the tense conversation he has with Beauchamp and Bob in prison, when he talks about the necessary coldness to kill someone (something that will have a direct reflection in the third act of the narrative, when only he and Munny fit into this situation). The duo Harris and Hackman still live one of the great moments of the feature, when Bill interrogates and searches Bob, then assaulting him under the incredulous gaze of the entire city, in an attempt to maintain control of the situation and, at the same time, send a message. Message to all the murderers in the region (""No one will come"", says one of the worried prostitutes). Unfortunately for Bill, the message never reached William Munny. Always firm, Eastwood convinces in the role of the veteran who returns to active duty only to get enough money to raise his children with more dignity. Your William Munny carries the weight of the past in his sad face and the weight of age is also evident, for example, in his difficulty to mount his horse. After a dark past, Munny is now a careful father, who avoids talking about the past in front of the children and even corrects his son when he hears a bad word (""Be careful how he says it""). His wife Claudia really changed his life, as he makes clear in phrases like ""It was the whiskey that made me that way. My wife cured me of drunkenness and wickedness."" He is no longer a murderer, has stopped drinking whiskey and now cares about his reputation, something that is evident every time someone mentions his past (""I'm not like that anymore"") and when he turns down a prostitute, in a touching and touching scene. Beautiful (""I admire you for being faithful to your wife""). But Claudia was no longer present and now he was back in that life, even if he didn't admit it, as his disapproving look indicates when he hears from his friend Ned that ""if Claudia were alive, he wouldn't be doing that"". But unlike in the past, now William immediately feels the weight of what he did after killing a man, and Eastwood demonstrates the character's discomfort well, playing with a pebble while looking down sadly and shouting for water to the dying boy, like this like Freeman also illustrates Ned's discomfort through his suffering countenance. Upon discovering that Ned was beaten to death by Bill, William Munny's old killer instinct comes to the fore, something illustrated in a small gesture of the character, who picks up the whiskey bottle and takes many sips. The empty bottle, lying in the mud in the rain, indicates that the old killer is back and the sensational ending of ""Unforgiven"" begins when his rifle interrupts the celebrations of Little Bill and his friends at the bar. The dialogue that precedes the shooting is a great tribute to the genre that made Eastwood famous, filled with striking phrases like ""I've killed women and children. I've already killed everything that walks and crawls and I'm here to kill you Little Bill for what you did to Ned"" (notice the glint in Beauchamp's eyes when he heard the phrase and realized that he was facing a true legend). This type of catchphrase was traditional in the western. The shooting that follows is a synthesis of everything the film preaches, showing that it is not easy to pick up a gun and shoot a man. For this reason, while Munny lands practically all of his shots, the others shoot in any direction, without direction, or run away, afraid of a real killer. The anthological finale, with Munny and Bill scheduling to meet each other in hell is fabulous. And all the glories of this film were deserved, as it managed to give a dignified end to a genre that was in its last breaths, which would probably end up being forgotten. Eastwood merits, star of the genre, who with this film paid homage to the western, and, consciously, also made the will of the same. As well illustrated by the simple sentence that closes ""The Unforgivable"", even a cruel killer can change his behavior next to a person who is worth it. If nothing explained to Mrs. Feathers why her daughter married a violent and merciless man, the feature explains how a man marked by violent roles can, over the years, display such sensitivity and deliver us works as mature as this excellent one"" Unforgiven""."
Unforgiven (1992),A scathing review of the brutality of the west,"TL; DR Good Movie go watch it. Unforgiven is not only a Movie but a brilliant representation of the glorification and justification of violence in the media. The film does not shy away from the savagery of the abuse received by the character of English Bob. The character, though useless, is the representation of the belief of romance and whimsy of the old west. The scribe of English bob, W. W Beachamp, follows this belief until the brutality is truly revealed to him. However, the morbid curiosity of man leads to W. W Beachamp following the character of Little Bill Daggett, The cruel and barbaric sheriff of the town. This man is a representation of the cold-blooded nature of the old west. The main character in this film is William Munny, an ex-outlaw who has regret for his actions. The character of the Scoville kid serves as a newcomer into the violence of the old west. A man who has always been tempted by the idea of the romance of tracking down outlaws. However, as he learns later in the movie, taking another's life is hardly romantic, more tragic. The movie shares multiple similarities with Homer's Iliad with the character William Munny being the character of Achilles. Both suffer the death of their best male friend, neither wanting to kill but after suffering the death of their best friend, both extract revenge by killing those responsible ignoring the morals that brought them there in the first place, however a key difference between Homer's Iliad and Unforgiven is Achilles was fated to die at the end of the trojan war whereas Clint Eastwoods character escapes, seemingly escaping his fate. This film contrasts the cockiness and extroverted nature of much of his
previous roles, here he seems tired and done with life, a show of how the life of an actor has affected him. The film seems like a personal story to him like birdman for Michael Keaton or elemental for that other guy."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),Operatic,"This might be the best spaghetti western I've seen. It opens with all the things we've now grown to expect from them 3 men and their ugly, sweaty, bearded weathered faces, with greasy hair and the sweat shinning off them, this is not a romantic west at all, but a dirty and violent place but one with great style and flair too. The cinematography is really great in this film, it lends it an operatic quality as does the music, the camera is able to glide through and above the characters. The Blu Ray transfer is excellent, it's a widescreen movie and one that avoids lots of bold primary colours in favour of a more worn out look. It still has a few flaws, the obvious dubbing, the cartoony sound effects when people are punched but generally this is a really stylish film, the humour if there is any is very subtle, all the characters have a certain mystery to them, we don't know them and they don't really know each other. Character introductions are handled really well, they really announce themselves, one character is so mysterious we don't even know his name and neither does anyone else apparently. He just sits in the corner of the bar and plays his harmonica, the music from it and even the sound of trains breaking is mixed into the soundtrack so well. The plot is a bit convoluted and messy at times, half way through one character has to spend about 2 minutes of exposition explaining what's happening and how he saw it all in a document, they were probably aware the audience would be getting lost by that point. There's a scene early on which is simply horrific and is a complete shocker, it's a shame though it's largely forgotten about towards the end among all the characters. For me though it's still haunting and done with practically no music. As ever the source of all the hurt and suffering and death is greed, greed over money, greed over land, the country wasn't build by purely noble spirits the film seems to be telling us. The ending though really works, it goes on but I found all of that last bit very satisfying. There's still a little bit of the old romantic left in the spaghetti western too, and this film has it. Directed by an Italian and filmed in the USA it's almost like an opera, it's that personal and epic. The film does borrow from others but it does it in it's own unique style. Thoroughly entertaining and thrilling."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),Wish Fulfillment Boy's Movie with Lots of Sexism,"Wish fulfillment fantasy for boys who wanna be tough, in control, brutal, dominant, evil or heroic, etc. Very sexist representation of the central female character, but, after all, this is a boy's fantasy. Couldn't get past Cardinale's weird dubbed voice and massive fake eyelashes. Pretty scenery, comic book plot. Amazing that anyone considers this shallow, trite, pseudo-deep, pretentious series of facial closeups a masterpiece. I'll just add that it's really sad that truly great cinema from Italy has only a small percentage of the reviews that this film has. But those are films that make you think, that challenge you, that are intelligent, that cause you to feel things deeply. But given the almost complete takeover of American cinema by comic book characters, it's not surprising that a Western version is so popular."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),an American saga made in Europe,"Sergio Leone directed seven feature films throughout his career. Seven films out of which six, grouped in two trilogies, are enough for his name to be considered today among the most important directors of the 20th century. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968) is the first film of the second trilogy. In the previous years he had made the three spaghetti western films which are today considered a revolution in the history of the western genre and perhaps the films that saved this genre and demonstrated its vitality, ensuring it a future. The first films were made with the modest financial means typical of European films. In 1968, for 'Once Upon a Time in the West', Leone obtained financing from one of the major American studios, Paramount. With their money he afforded a lavish production and he was able to approach first rank Hollywood stars for casting. Henri Fonda responded, and his inclusion in the cast is a nice homage to classic American westerns. Asa reward, Leone cast him in the first big 'bad guy' role of his career and gave him the opportunity to play for the first time ... in a bedroom scene. He filmed lavishly, with many extras and super production sets. Some scenes are filmed in the American state of Utah, in the desert area where the story of the film takes place. However, most of the filming was again done in Spain, as in the previous films, and the studio scenes at Cinecittà. After changing the destiny of westerns, Sergio Leone inaugurates with this film the 'Once Upon a Time ...' trilogy and opens a new perspective to the genre of the great American epics. The original script is signed by Leone together with Sergio Donati, but Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento also took part in the writing of the story on which it is based. We are in a dusty town on the edge of the desert, on America's moving frontier. Construction of the railroad that will cross the continent to the Pacific is nearing. If there are laws, they aren't really followed, and everyone kind of makes their own law, often with the help of guns and gunmen gangs. Jill McBain is a beautiful woman from New Orleans who arrives in the city to meet her future husband. However, she finds herself in the situation of a widow, because the man she had married by correspondence had just been assassinated along with his three children. The reason and the stake is the land in his property, through which the railway line is to pass, land which the tycoon Morgan wants to seize with the help of the gunmen gang led by a bad fellow named Frank. Jill decides to stay to fight for the inherited property and to make her husband's dream of building a prosperous city around a future train station a reality. She will be helped by other characters always on the edge of the law and by a mysterious man who plays the harmonica and seems interested in Frank's person. They all wield their guns with dexterity, and these don't stay unused too long time throughout the story. Sergio Leone narrates as if he and his audience have all the time in the world. A scene can last ten or fifteen minutes, culminating in a gunfight lasting a few seconds. Each scene, however, is a story in itself, with characters that we know to the whites of their eyes and a setting in which we seem to be absorbed. Today a duration of more than two and a half hours for a film is something common, but in the 60s it was an exception. Sergio Leone actually sets a kind of standard in terms of running time for films depicting great American stories. To accommodate the format of American screenings, producers and distributors created shorter versions, and this also happened here and with other of his films. Each of the actors is given plenty of time to develop their character, and this happens even with the supporting roles, and there are many memorable ones in 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. The big roles cast is outstanding. Sergio Leone chooses first-rate actors, but counter-casts them in roles different than the usual in their careers up to that point, which reinforces the freshness feeling that we get while watching the film. Henry Fonda abandons the character of a man of justice and good causes and crosses over to the other side of the law. Charles Bronson on the other hand gives one of the best roles of his career as a positive character in the role of the mysterious man with a harmonica, proving what a good actor he was in addition to his acting talent in action films. Claudia Cardinale develops with charm and charisma the role of the widow, a role that was originally written for Sophia Loren. Ennio Morricone's music is organically integrated into the complete visual and emotional experience this film provides. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a timeless masterpiece."

Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),Sergio Leone's gloomest movies,"(1968) Once Upon a Time in the West
WESTERN One of director Sergio Leone's most darkest film involving total retribution and a railroad line! The film Eastwood was supposed to star in but refused since he wanted to do other things and other projects. The film stars Leone's all time favorite actor by the name of Henry Fonda whose memorable as Frank as the most ruthless and the most sadistic villain in movie Western history! Charles Bronson plays Harmonica whose set out to kill him leaving viewers speculating what the connection is going to be! The problem, the Henry Fonda character whose totally an unlikable character screen presence especially in terms of it's running time overshadows the person viewers is supposed to root for which is Harmonica, the Charles Bronson character! Bronson's role is almost as absent as the rest of the cast by comparison with Henry Fonda's! And as usual excellent photography and musical score by Ennio Morricone but somewhat depressing and not fun to look at compared with Leone's other efforts."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),Emperor's New Clothes,"The most overrated movie of all time. Starts with a ludicrous gunfight at the station (with a badly dubbed harmonica playing). Slow to the point of ponderous? No. Slow to the point of boring. Main characters stand and stand and stand, then speak a few words - this is repeated interminably. Leone obviously decided the ponderous approach had worked well in the Clint Eastwood trilogy, so he thought he'd extend - and extend he did - scenes in this tedious, self indulgent piece. The buildings all look like the movie sets that they are. Fonda is a great actor with a tendency to be a little wooden when he's off form. Leone exploits this wooden aspect to the full. If you like watching people stare and do things very slowly, this is for you. Movie could be better if it was cut to 75 minutes instead of the elongated bore-fest it is."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),Iconic Sergio Leone,"Sergio Leone needs little introduction; the man who basically reinvented the western and crime drama genres with his several masterpieces. And Once upon a time in the west, like the majority of his ever impressive filmography, is undoubtely a grand masterpiece within the genre, as well as within film history overall. The conventions of the genre are well established and utilized, yet doesn't delve into cliché, and tells a very profound and indepth, engaging story that sets it apart from the genre. The actors all do an incredible job, as one would expect from such a great cast, all of them legendary names. The cinematography, cutting and editing is flawless - in typical Leone fashion. And Ennio Morricone's ever beautiful score is not to be missed. Overall, truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and a must see for every lover of film!"
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),"GREAT GREAT MOVIE, BUT...","If the protagonist had been Clint Eastwood, the film would have been much better. Sergio Leone's shooting is nothing short of amazing. The strong point of this film, for me, are the scenes where we can listen to the melodies of the Maestro Ennio Morricone. But all in all I am of the opinion that with the protagonist of Leone's first 3 westerns, this film would have been much better. Because it is clear that the first choice was Clint, we can see it from how Charles Bronson behaves. Another thing that amazed me is the twist when it turns out that ""Harmonica"" wants revenge for the killing of his brother."
Once Upon a Time in the West (1968),I Choo-Choo Choose You,"Sergio Leone's double-down ""more-western than any western because it's bolted together from a thousand westerns"" western is intoxicatingly atmospheric. When I first viewed it I compared it unfavourably to Good, Bad, Ugly because I had loved the more humorous and characterful vibe of that - but seeing this in isolation it just washes over you. That haunting music, all those gnarly sweaty faces, and the sheer scale of it. It's both quite dated (the powerpoint presentation titles that sidle around the screen, and the characteristically inconsistent dubbing) and strangely timeless. It feels vividly real. As an achievement it is totemic."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),A fantastic classic.,"It develops its characters very well, showcasing their personalities and idiosyncrasies without the need for expositional dialogue. Additionally, the dynamic that arises among them is perfect. Although the soundtrack is very good and memorable, it pales in comparison to that of other classic westerns. While it draws from the premise of Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' (which is quite evident), it makes a couple of changes that subvert the expectations of those who have seen Kurosawa's work. As a weak point, the somewhat hasty deaths of some of the main characters can be mentioned, and perhaps the worst is the villain and his group, who, against all logic, decide at a certain point in the movie to squander their advantage. The performances are good, at least in the 9 or 10 characters who have more screen time, but the other supporting characters don't even seem to be trying. In conclusion, highly recommended."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),Classic western.,"The film has lots of positive things about it, the cinematography and locations all look marvellous (shoot in Mexico), the film has a nice pace to it, there are slower more reflective moments too, mixed in between the action, something which has become standard today. The tone is fun and light, there is lots of violence but little gore, children should be fine watching it. The introduction of the seven gun slingers was really well done. The film is very easy to follow and has a simple theme of right v wrong, good v evil. The colour palate is well thought through, the white costumes of the villagers help the cowboys stand out against them. All of the acting is top notch and the director gets great performances out of all the cast. The score is maybe the best thing about the film, it's just terrific and really adds extra energy to each scene it's used in. Yul Brynner is also really good in his role as the leader while Eli Wallach plays a top villain. The soundtrack is also utterly iconic and memorable. On the negative side the story is a little thin, the characters are slightly 1 dimensional stereotypes of various kinds, some of the dialogue seems very much like it's been ADR. There's also a love story subplot shoe horned in which could have been left out."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),Steve McQueen was cool.,"'The Magnificent Seven' is a 1960 American Western film directed by John Sturges. The screenplay is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese film 'Seven Samurai'. The cast includes Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson. The first time I saw Steve McQueen was in a TV drama. It was 'Wanted Dead or Alive,' which aired on CBS in the U. S. from September 1958 to March 1961. I was fascinated by his coolness and became a big fan. 'The Magnificent Seven' was the first time McQueen appeared on the screen in a leading role. The action scenes were so cool that I watched all his major films after that. I recently read a biography of McQueen. ""Steve McQueen: The Salvation of an American Icon"" by Greg Laurie. It is a true portrait of McQueen. His father was an aerobatic stunt pilot. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and his biological father disappeared, never to be seen again. His mother remarried and he had a difficult relationship with his stepfather, leading to delinquency and a stint in a juvenile reformatory. After his discharge from the Marine Corps, he began his career as an actor. He was greedy for film roles. Known as ""The King of Cool"", he became one of the top stars of the 1960s. Then, at the age of 50, he succumbed to cancer. He gave his last interview before his death and answered, ""Height 176cm - Blonde hair - Specialty: Car driving- What I want: My own father."" A lifetime of loneliness in the heart of a great star. Deeply moving."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),"I hope the 2016 movie lives up to its predecessor, that's all I'm saying","I've never watched the original ""Seven Samurai"" that this movie is based on, but from what I've seen, if this is an American-stylized remake, I cannot imagine how good the original is. The cast and acting bodes well to the time it was made, which threw me for a loop when I heard when it was made. This movie has so many new age contemporary western elements, I thought it was filmed succeeding the era of Wayne and Eastwood, but actually came before. The direction and writing and pacing of this movie is fully fleshed out; you wouldn't be able to tell it was two hours unless you were actively watching the timebar. While I may not be as knowledgeable of the filmography of Steve McQueen as, say, my grandfather would be, it was still enjoyable and the ending was impactful nevertheless. Overall, a great movie; will be watching the 2016 reboot soon."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),Magnificent western reimagining,"The pun in the headline is somewhat unintended, but speaks rather true indeed for the success of this great classic. Inspired by and adapted from the master of western and samurai films himself, Kurosawa - there could be no one better, of course, than the great John Sturges, to make his own unique interpretation of it all. And it is indeed a remarkable western, one of the standouts, to say the least, and one that utilizes the greatness of the original, whilst providing its own mark and tone; as it should. The actors all do an incredible job, as one would expect from such a legendary cast, and the script is stellar as ever. The cinematography, cutting and editing is great, very much in line with Sturge's style, for sure. Very beautifully put together. Very exciting, great overall. Definitely a standout and highly recommended film, that every lover of film should watch!"
The Magnificent Seven (1960),"A classic in its day, but looks dated now","This movie was a big hit when it first came out in 1960, and quickly came to be regarded as a classic. Some of its themes became cultural memes in their own right - such as the snazzy all-black gunslinger's outfit sported by Yul Brynner (which he later reprised in ""Westworld"") and the music, which went on to become the signature theme of a leading cigarette company for many years, and was emulated in other contexts. Other than the cultural influences though, it's a movie that hasn't aged particularly well. It was made shortly before the avalanche of filmic experimentation - including the rise of the antihero - that became known as the ""New Hollywood"", and consequently looks somewhat dated from a modern perspective. Indeed, apart from one or two mild innovations, it could almost have been made in the 1940s. Much of the film's early drama revolves around the antics of the young wannabe-gunslinger referred to as ""the kid"", played by Horst Buchholz. It is therefore very important that these scenes work, but in my opinion, they don't, and this represents perhaps the movie's major failing. To begin with, Buchholz simply looks too old for the part - he was in his late twenties when cast, and could probably have passed for thirty. That is hardly young enough to be considered a kid, particularly in a role that seems written for a teenager. Also, Buchholz was a German actor, and although his English is flawless, he has an oddly stilted way of delivering his lines that just doesn't sound American, either in accent or idiom. The result is that rather than being endearingly gauche, he comes across more as dangerously unstable. The warmth the other characters express toward him thereby seems inappropriate, reducing the viewer's sense of identification with them. To be fair to Buchholz, the script itself is perhaps not all that well crafted in these early scenes - and he does do better later on. But damage done early to viewer immersion is hard to undo. The main strengths of the movie come relatively late. The first of these are the scenes of regret and self-doubt expressed by the gunslingers. This degree of introspection represented something of a break from earlier Westerns, where the heroes were typically unambiguously tough guys, epitomized by the likes of John Wayne. If it does represent a break from earlier Westerns though, it's a relatively timid one compared to what Hollywood would be doing a few years later. The second late element in the movie that works surprisingly well is a budding romance, which rather than looking gratuitous, serves to highlight the comparatively lonely and arduous lives of the gunslingers, which in turn underscores the elements of sacrifice and redemption implicit in their defence of the villagers. I see that some other reviewers at IMDB have criticized the final shootout as anticlimactic. From a modern perspective, it probably is, but in its day it was considered epic. Audience expectations have changed. Buchholz's early scenes notwithstanding, the cast generally delivers good performances. Not all were well known at the time, but a number later became stars in their own right. The screen presences not only of Brynner and McQueen, but also of Robert Vaughan, James Coburn and Charles Bronson - even given their relatively small roles - are palpable. A couple of minor observations. Brynner was reportedly upset with McQueen during the shoot, as he felt the latter was constantly trying to scene-steal. If so, he had nothing to worry about. With his dignified bearing and deep, sonorous voice (not to mention the aforementioned stylish outfit) Brynner dominates almost every scene in which he appears. The exceptions are perhaps when McQueen is handling a gun; a former marine, his confident ease with firearms has perhaps never been surpassed onscreen (see, for example, ""The Getaway""). One final oddity - the Mexican peasants are all dressed in immaculate white outfits, which look very odd considering their line of work. The movie was shot partly in Mexico and apparently the authorities insisted on this detail. To summarize: the movie might be worth a look, if only for the cultural interest and to enjoy some early performances from a bevy of future stars, but from a modern perspective it is less than ""magnificent""."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),Doesn't age well,"It's a Western set primarily in a small Mexican town. It follows seven gunmen a small town hired to protect it from a gang that frequently pillaged it. Calvera (Eli Wallach) leads a bandit gang against a defenseless town where the inhabitants have no guns and live in great fear. Three of them go to South Texas to buy weapons, but end up hiring seven men to protect them. Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) becomes the leader of the group. Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen) helps him settle a dispute in Texas and comes along. Chico (Horst Buchholz) is a young Mexican who wants to make a reputation as a gunfighter. Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is broke and needs another gunfighting gig. Lee (Robert Vaughan) is a noted gunfighter who has lost his nerve. Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) thinks there must be a fortune to be made. Britt (James Coburn) is quick with a knife and a gun. ""The Magnificent Seven"" sets the storyline, then spends time as Chris assembles the group that eventually heads to Mexico. The film then follows the early encounters with the villagers, the first skirmishes with Calvera's men, the first major battle, the trickery that finds the Seven outfoxed and sent on their way, and the final encounter. The movie contains some clever humor but does not age well in depicting race or female autonomy. Given the profile and visibility of the Magnificent Seven actors, it's a case of American gunslingers saving the day for docile Mexicans. The original ""Seven Samurai."" may have class problems but not racial issues. I hope to see it in the not-too-distant future. The musical score is well-known, and the actors do well with the transplanted and shorter script. But ""The Magnificent Seven"" is not a classic."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),A classic western worthy of a re-watch,"I re-watched ""The Magnificent Seven"" last night. A classic western with a great cast - Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, and Horst Buchholz as the seven. And Eli Wallach is great as the evil leader of the bandits. Filmed in Panavision, it is a feast for the eyes to view in HD (I haven't bought the 4k version yet!). It is well-acted by all, and direction is fine. The last 1/3 of the movie drags a bit, it could be edited better. But still a classic film worthy of a re-watch. 8/10. A side note: Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen were reportedly feuding with each other, with McQueen trying to upstage Brynner at every opportunity, but both have denied it."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),An average western with a great cast. Enjoy.,"The plot is fairly simple. Basically a Mexican village is being plundered by an evil Mexican crime lord Calvarez. The villagers don't have the physical means as yet to defend themselves so seek help from American gunslingers formed by Yul Brynner as a character called Chris. The cast are like a who's who of early sixties cinema and it is no surprise to see the director of the film is John Sturges who would go on to direct The Great Escape, another all-star vehicle some three years later. Listen out for another rousing score from Elmer Bernstein permeates the film and is still featured in other productions over sixty years later. The opening credits reveal the film to be itself a remake of an even older Japanese classic The Seven Sumarai (1954). The film has massive shoot outs that got me thinking afterwards, I have watched several 'revisionist' Westerns from director Sam Peckinpah recently that are far more gritty and violent in the process. Perhaps that approach would have been better in this film? I suppose Hollywood Western cinema wasn't quite ready for that yet and the arrival of such films and the spaghetti westerns was nearly a decade away. The shoot out's despite their length and the great time that went into their production do look tame by the standards of later Westerns is my point I suppose."
The Magnificent Seven (1960),Outstanding Western. Great movie.,"Even if one doesn't particularly like Westerns, the Magnificent Seven is requisite viewing. It deserves to be on everyone's Top 25 Movies You Must See. And it has perhaps the best theme song written for any movie. Be sure to watch the DVD extras. The background and analysis definitely enhance appreciate for this quintessential Western. I loved this ever since I saw it in a Drive-In soon after its release. As my ability to comprehend the subtleties developed, my appreciation grew. The collection of stars. ""Clap your hands."" The camera following the horses leaping the walls. Steve McQueen story-telling ""so far, so good"" and ""seemed like a good idea at the time."" The dialogue between the mortician and the traveling salesman about getting old Joe buried on Boot Hill. Stop the DVD, back it up and replay it to catch ever word. The economy of dialogue belies how richly nuanced each word is. Eli Wallach is superb. Not a dud in the lot. (I did get teary-eyed as several beloved actors' characters were killed. But I was ten then.)"
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),meaningless movie,"Not really sure what people see in this, just a bunch of short stories, meaningless, pointless and nothing more. I guess the C Bros have enough credibility to make people watch whatever they do and ""like"" it. Unless you have a very shallow personality and ADHD then this is gonna be a big waste of your time. A waste of cast and money to be honest. Cowboys and shootings and weird story after weird story with zero connection to each other and zero meaning. I kept watching just to see if im missing some important twist or point but in the end i didnt miss any point cause there was no point to the whole thing."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),An experimental Western anthology for the Coen Brothers,"Following the release of Hail, Caesar! In 2016, the Coen Brothers decided on a somewhat different approach for their next film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Firstly, it's an anthology film consisting of six short stories linked only - at first glance - by the fact that they are all Westerns; secondly, it's their first digital film, a format they had not previously experimented with; and thirdly, in a major departure likely to annoy anyone unwilling to pay subscription fees, it was released exclusively on the streaming television service Netflix. The involvement of Netflix and the use of digital technology are, ultimately, largely irrelevant; it is the film's structure - thus far unique in the Coen Brothers' filmography - that makes it really interesting. Of the four short stories, four are original tales penned by the brothers, whilst two are based - if only loosely - on existing short stories by other writers (Jack London and Stewart Edward White, both long-deceased American novelists). As noted, all six are set in the Wild West, but are quite varied in tone and content; all have the quirky characters and in some cases characteristic absurdity of previous Coen Brothers films, not to mention the often pitch-black humour. The first story is 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs', which may seem to set the tone for the rest of the anthology, but actually doesn't: it's an absurd and very funny tale of the eponymous cowboy (played by Tim Blake Nelson), a jovial but stone-cold killer who sings and plays the guitar and breaks the fourth wall in the very first scene. By contrast, 'Near Algodones' is a bone-dry black comedy starring James Franco as a young cowboy who robs and bank and is sentenced by a literal lynch-mob to be hanged -he ultimately is, but not quite as quickly as planned thanks to an deliberately deus ex machina plot development at a critical moment. 'Meal Ticket' stars Liam Neeson as an aging impresario, and it's the darkest and most macabre of the lot with almost Grand Guignol-like overtones, as he finds that a chicken capable of arithmetic is more useful than the quadruple amputee who has previously been central to his show and who suddenly becomes surplus to requirement. 'All Gold Canyon' is a two-hander, starring Tom Waits as a Prospector and Sam Dillon as the Young Man who tries to murder and rob him; Dillon's role is entirely non-speaking and Waits spends the oddly charming episode muttering to himself. 'The Gal Who Got Rattled' is a bizarre and witty tragedy that stars Zoe Kazan as Alice Longabaugh, who seemingly finds a way out of her tribulations thanks to a handsome cowboy (Bill Heck's Billy Knapp) and looks all set for a happy ending until a twist of fate sees her cut down by her own hand in a moment of misunderstanding. Finally, 'The Mortal Remains' is a blackly comic tale of five travellers sharing a stagecoach on route to a hotel, only for three of them to become deeply unsettled when two of them - Thigpen and Clarence, played by Jonjo O'Neill and the great Brendan Gleeson - eventually turn out to be bounty hunters, whose favourite technique to distract their victims with conversation before killing them; it's very heavily dialogue and character-based and it's gleefully witty. It isn't just the Western setting - or the Coen Brothers' sense of humour - that unites these six stories; all of them provide object lessons in the fickle nature of fate, as random events and chance encounters change or end people's lives. At the same time, the film is both a celebration of the freedom and natural beauty of the Western frontier, whilst at the same time reminding the viewer that living in it was difficult, dangerous, and often nightmarish. The former is reflected in the glorious and extensive location filming, rendered painterly by the cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel, who proves able to make the Wild West look variously beautiful, menacing, and strangely oppressive. There's a great scene in 'All Gold Canyon' when the Prospector climbs a tree to steal an owl's eggs for his meal; when he catches the owl silently staring at him, he reluctantly returns all but one of them to the nest, a scene which is both beautifully shot and which also illustrates the difficult and compromised relationship between man and nature. As usual, the Coen Brothers idiosyncratic directing style complements their scriptwriting. There are numerous stylistic flourishes, notably the fact that the film is framed by its opening and end titles as a book of tales of the frontier, complete with ""color plates"", which are used to introduce each tale. Some of the segments aim for realism, with understandably unfashionable clashes between settlers and hostile Native Americans, whilst others eschew this for the sake of dramatic effect: 'Meal Ticket' is self-consciously theatrical in its visuals (reflecting the subject matter), whilst 'The Mortal Remains' takes place almost entirely within a stagecoach and briefly within a deliberately gothic looking hotel, reflecting the claustrophobia that Mrs. Betjemen, René and the Trapper undoubtedly experience when they realise that their fellow travellers are hired killers. Absurdly, 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' ends with the recently deceased titular character singing a duet with his killer as he flies up to heaven on angel wings. As usual for the Coen Brothers, music is important throughout, with Scruggs riding along singing and playing a guitar at the very start of the film. The large ensemble cast is exceptional, with even the bit parts occupied by actors of the calibre of Clancy Brown and Ralph Ineson. Nobody gives a bad performance, be it Stephen Root in a small but great comic performance as the eccentric Teller, Harry Melling as limbless orator Harrison (Harrison's orations aside, there's very little dialogue in 'Meal Ticket', with Melling and Neeson conveying much through facial acting), or Grainger Hines as the taciturn Mr Arthur. There is arguably no such thing as a typical Coen Brothers film: they have embraced numerous genres both dramatic and comic (or a combination of the two), and although their films are immediately recognisable as their work, each has a distinctive identity all of its own. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs continues that trend, proving that despite their already formidable body of cinematic works, Joel and Ethan still have plenty of new frontiers left to explore."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),Watching this movie was like reading a book in a good way,"Watching this movie was like reading a book in a good way. Jack London comes to mind. I did not really like the first 3 stories, but finally I got drawn in by the plight of old prospector. Well, by all means Cohen brothers have created a gem of a homage to the Western genre. This is a cinematic delight and feels like a movie made back in the 70s-80s before Hollywood turned art of cinema into an amusement park kind of offering with never ending stream of cliches, tired platitudes, chases, CGI effects and green screens. Superb acting, costumes, sets, camera work. Stories are kind of simple, dialogs/monologues are sparse, making it feel very real. I am not even a fun of Westerns, but I thoroughly enjoyed this offering by Cohen bros."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),A Wild West Whimsy: Galloping Through 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"Hold onto your ten-gallon hats, cinephiles! The Coen Brothers are back in the saddle with ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" a rollicking anthology that takes us on a wild ride through the Old West, one tall tale at a time. From the hilariously self-aware gunslinger Buster Scruggs (who serenades us with as much gusto as he shoots) to the poignant tale of a limbless orator, this film is a smorgasbord of emotions, served with a side of classic Coen quirk. It's as if the Wild West decided to throw a carnival, and every attraction is a blend of the bizarre, the tragic, and the downright hilarious. Each segment of this anthology feels like unwrapping a peculiar present, never quite knowing what you'll get, but always delighted by the surprise. The Coens, with their signature blend of dark humor and profound insight, have crafted a film that's both a love letter to Westerns and a playful poke at their tropes. ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a cinematic campfire around which we gather, captivated by the Coens' storytelling prowess, chuckling one moment and choked up the next. So, saddle up, partner, and let's gallop through this whimsical West where the Coens are the sheriffs, and we're all just along for the ride!"
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),The Netflix trailers make this look like a comedy. Is not most certainly not.,"I understand why people would like this. It's well acted, well shot and technically it is a very good film. I have no desire to watch it ever again because after the first story, everything is tragedy after tragedy that stack up. I was completely unprepared for such a film because the trailers focus so much on Tim Blake Nelson and the light-hearted tone of the first story. The story with Liam Nelson and Harry Melling was the toughest for me. I almost turned the film off after that one. I've rated this film a 5 because I can see some of the technical brilliance of the Coen Brothers in every story and it reminds me of their better films that I will re-watch for years to come. But for anyone going into this one thinking that the whole film is going to be like the trailers and promos, you will want to think twice."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),Name and Trailer are misleading,"In the end its a fun anthology movie of comedic western plot lines. Though I remain largely disappointed as the name of the movie and the trailer I saw for it implied that the whole movie would be centered around Buster Scruggs, a character I wanted to continue following more so than see the other stories Ultimately it was fun movie in which the stories when down in quality as it continued. Buster Scruggs is best and is the movie I wanted, fun to see where those James Franco hanging memes come from, but his plot was pretty meh, and it only gets more meh from there. The gold digger plot was predictable, the widow (?) maybe sister of a dead man ( I wasn't entirely sure on this plot point as it went on...I think sister though) was long and not very interesting. The final one was kind of interesting in a thriller sort of way....and I'm forgetting at least one plot which means it was boring. (P. S. yes I was so mad that i made an account to talk about it even if its still a meh movie :P)"
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),Disconnected stories,"You will watch 5 distinct short films happening in post civil war era in wild west. The Ballad of Buster Scruggsis a sharp shooter which ""rises to fames of being a sharp shooter then falls in the same realm"". This was a fun and upbeat short story. Near Algodones this is about a bank robber that is successful at robbing the bank but the smart bank teller knocks him out wearing pots and pans and knocks him out with his rifle, as he is about to get hung he is saved by a cattle thieve which scapes and then the rubber is hung for stealing the cattle. So we can say ""even if you scape fate is going to catchup on you"" Meal Ticket the story seems about a mobile one person theatrical show. At first he seems to be kind person helping a person with no arms and legs do a vocal show. As their show can't attract enough visitors he figures out that a chicken can do fun tricks to get a large gathering. He then dumps the cripple in water and move on with the chicken to continue his show business. So there you go, ""he wasn't kind after all. The cripple was serving his interest."" All Gold Canyon an old man finds his luck in the middle of nowhere, as he is about to harvest his effort a bystander tries to kill him and take the loot. But you feel like the universe is rewarding the old man to survive and ""reap the fruit of his efforts"" and gets to go and sell his gold. In part you could tell it might have been because he was fair and didn't eat all the eggs of the owl. -The Gal Who Got Rattled this one was so all over the place you can't tell how the story unfolds and can't tell why it ends the way it ended. ""The girl was naive and couldn't survive the complexity of life"". The Mortal Remains this one was about five passengers that share a ride but I couldn't figure out what bounty hunters had to do with the other three passengers and why the story ended the way it ended. Over all the cinematography was good but the story line was hard to follow in majority of the film. It was so disparate."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),A well made composition of short stories.,"This film is very brilliantly and thoughtfully written. The lines fit the characters perfectly. Composed of 6 short stories, this movie contains scenes featuring beautiful cinematography and A-class acting from each actor. With some stories better than others, this movie never lacks genius dialogue and blatantly entertaining stories. It may take a few watches to fully admire the way the Coen Brothers wrote and directed this, but in my personal opinion it is a very well made and entertaining film. Some may find themselves bored during some of the stories, as did I the first or second watch. But especially the first and third story are absolute masterpieces that deserve much more recognition."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),The filmmaking is of top class,"This anthology film is the result of six American frontier stories that the Coen brothers had written over the years. The stories all share a Western theme, but differ in just about every other respect, ranging from the giddy title story via the otherworldly ""Meal Ticket"" to the cheerful ""All Gold Canyon"" and the poignant ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"". The filmmaking is of top class all along, and the stories all leave their mark in some way or other, , but the most idiosyncratic one is arguably the title segment. My favourite of many fine performances here, however, belongs to Tom Waits (who is not alien to anthology films) as an infectiously optimistic prospector."
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018),Amazing scenery and storytelling,"These 6 short stories take viewers to a post civil war west of the USA. Well-written stories make these 2 hours pass by almost instantly. 1. ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" - 7. 2.""Near Algodones"" - 7. 3.""Meal Ticket"" - 6. 4.""All Gold Canyon"" - 8. 5.""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" - 9. 6.""The Mortal Remains"" - 8. Overall 8. I can recommend to watch, if u like westerns and short, entertaining stories. Some moments of the movie are stuck in my memory. For example, the landscapes of Colorado in the story about the gold digger. Or the look of James Franco from the gallows at the young lady in the crowd. Or there's just a beautiful Indian shootout scene at the end of the fifth story, filled with such inner tension that it's immediately clear that the Coens were filming."
El Camino Christmas (2017),An uneven mess!,El Camino Christmas has a star studded cast but sad to say it is very flat with an uneven story. The movie doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or more of a dark drama/comedy. The end result comes out to be a less enjoyable experience by the viewer. This movie won't even make it onto my Holiday list of movies even though it has Christmas in the title. Dax Shepard and Tim Allen try their best to keep the movie afloat but they can only do so much. I honestly feel if they would have focused making this film more of a drama compared to a comedy that it would have turned out a lot better. El Camino Christmas gets a low 4 stars out of 10 from me:
El Camino Christmas (2017),Beautiful film,"Beautiful film. Anamorphic. Creative. If you a fan of film, you will love this movie. Simplistic beauty, very well made, an obvious stepping stone for someone destined to be a great. The ensemble of actors I thought was perfect, especially the Mexican guy, love that guy. And Jin Yang?! Yes. If you love anamorphic, check this film out and learn from it. You do not need a big Hollywood budget to make a great film that captures your attention for an hour and a half. This, to me, was much better than most of the Hollywood ""blockbusters"" that just suck these days. Bravo to the visionary and cast and crew. 8/10."
El Camino Christmas (2017),The Title is Misleading,"My wife and I wanted to watch a light Christmas movie and with Tim Allen in it we thought that is exactly what we would see, Instead it was , actually not sure, maybe a serious movie or a dark comedy, not sure, when it looked like a serious scene in the movie, Christmas music played in the background which was very confusing for us, my wife ended up watching most of it before she give up, I managed only about 45 minutes before I realized that this was not a Christmas movie or a light movie that we where looking for. Tim Allan was excellent as far as playing his character, but i could not figure out the alcohol cop, weather he was suppose to be funny or serious."
El Camino Christmas (2017),Boring,"This is easily one of the worst (if not the worst - and I've seen a lot of Christmas movies) Christmas films I've ever seen. It was incredibly boring. That's the most succinct review I can give. It was boring. The cast was quite good and they did what they could with the material they were given (was actually surprised by Tim Allen's performance, I've never seen him in a role like this and given a better script, he could really do something cool!) - that's probably why I gave it three stars instead of zero. But still, an actor can only do so much when they are handed a steaming pile of you-know-what to work with. This one is definitely a ""skip"" - you won't be missing anything."
El Camino Christmas (2017),A Christmas hostage movie that actually works,"A possibly misleading review title , but it does work even though it's a somewhat offbeat hostage movie. Eric Roth (Luke Grimes) arrives in town looking for his father, who left his family years earlier. No longer has he arrived when he gets involved with the local Police, who don't trust him. One of the officers is Carl Hooker (Vincent D'onofrio) who is a bit of a dodgy cop, he also meets Larry (Tim Allen), who turns up to be his father. Eric is detained by the police on drugs charges but escapes to the local diner, chased by the cops a hostage situation occurs (mainly because of Hooker). Hooker and Eric plus six hostages are in the diner when police, feds and a news crew (including a pregnant Jessica Alba) arrive and shooting starts. It's an enjoyable film with likeable performances from Grimes, Allen and Michelle Mylett as Eric's love interest. One of the better Netflix efforts."
El Camino Christmas (2017),Pretty Average Christmas,"For a pretty good cast El Camino Christmas is a surprisingly average film. No awards for this one! Filled with low light after low light the movie meanders its way to a very obvious conclusion and only the charm of Tim Allen (if you find him charming) really gives the film something to hang its hat on. It feels a little cheap and a bit nasty, because it is. If you are fans of the stars then I guess you will get something from it. For the others its really a miscible movie, part of a long line of such films that come out these days. From Netflix. So Yabba Dabba Do :) That's probably some kind of copyright infringement!"
El Camino Christmas (2017),"There is some real comedy genius here, but then it kind of falls apart at the end.","I love Dax Shepard, he is just naturally funny, but the real scene stealer in this film is the actor Luke Grimes, who underplays his character, Eric Norris. Eric Norris comes to the tiny Nevada town of El Camino looking for the father he has never met. He finds a drunk played by Tim Allen at the address. He also encounters two corrupt members of the local sheriff's office. He gets illegally apprehended, beat up and held in the county jail until the next morning when the junior deputy Calhoun, played by Dax Shepard, leaves him the keys and the door open while he goes to the bathroom. Unfortunately, Eric doesn't quite make it out of town before the other deputy, Carl Hooker, catches up to him and chases him into the local convenience store while opening fire on him. Inside the convenience store happens to be Tim Allen's character, Larry Roth, who happens to be a Vietnam vet who instinctively fires back at the deputy, shooting him in the leg. This creates a ""hostage-like"" situation that brings deputies and a local reporter to the scene. Lots of great actors and great acting in this film...great comedy, but as previously mentioned it kind of fizzes out at the end making this a watch and delete for me. There is one hilarious Christmas song and some sad Christmas decorations, but otherwise not really a ""Christmas movie"" in the standard sense. Lightweight and breezy, I recommend this to anyone who wants something light for Christmas."
El Camino Christmas (2017),Drama w/Comic Relief at best,"I thought, ""oh with Tim Allen, Red from That 70s Show, and Dax Shepherd this outta be hilarious.""... But this is not a comedy unless you have a pretty messed up sense of humor. Neither is it a family movie. It's not even a feel-good Christmas movie. There is some comic relief. But don't expect the Tim Allen we've seen in his other Christmas movies, comedies, and Last Man Standing. El Camino Christmas proves Tim can do serious stuff. Impressive. I feel all the acting is pretty good. Vincent D'Onofrio once again proves his diverse talent as well. I give this a 7 rating, because it is a good drama. Ordinarily I would find this movie ...entertaining? If that's what you can call a rather dark drama. It's just not the kind of movie I look for in the week before Christmas."
El Camino Christmas (2017),Average movie until the second half. Fun to watch.,"Tim Allen's best movie. The other performers did real well, and the story came together. The humor was black and rare in the beginning, but got much better as it went along. My favorite came at the end with the stuck-in-the-mud sheriff is getting mystical treatment for smoking cigarettes! The mute child finding his voice at the end was unnecessary. The father/son revelation was predictable, but, in the end, satisfyingly understated. Hilarious when two lawmen are shooting-at each other-through the building yelling ""Taking fire!"" D-Onofrio gives a performance every bit as good as Brian Dennehy used to do. Good movie."
El Camino Christmas (2017),Deserves a much better rating,"What a surprise! I saw this on Netflix and assumed it was a new release, but come to find out it's from 2017. As stated in the title, this film deserves a much better rating than it currently has. Everyone involved does a nice job in their roles. It's a simple story and premise but delivers in every way. Surprisingly, Tim Allen was fantastic. I can't believe I just wrote that. I've always found him to play sort of the same role all the time. With different variations of his Home Imorovement character. But he actually seems to dig in here and gives a great performance. Check this movie out, you'll be surprised."
Dances with Wolves (1990),A magnificent looking fellow,"To put it simply this is just the greatest movie I've ever seen! Kevin Costner excels here both in directing and acting not just recreating the great characters from Micheal Blake's book but clearly giving us the atmosphere and feel of it too! His performance is just great and the way his character develops is just a treat to watch
Everything about the movie is perfect! It all fits together like a jigsaw puzzle with John Barry's music like a fabulous cherry on top. You can just feel the characters as if you know them! And the sadness cuts deeps and highs feel great! It's just so damn good! Every damn shot is like a painting! And as an artist I love to paint em In all a piece of perfection
Not a damn thing you could do to make it any better! Kevin is a hero the world of cinema."
Dances with Wolves (1990),"A superb, sensitive beautiful film","A superbly directed film here from Kevin Costner, who probably was at the peak of his career with this film. Costner here plays another clean cut hero, the story is actually quite easy to follow which again I think is another credit to him. It has some really good cinematography and creative use of interesting camera angles, right from the opening of two armies facing off against each other. The use of the landscape is also very impressive, you truly feel the vastness of the earth, the sky, the details are also very well done on the uniforms of the soldiers, the dirty faces, the long beards, the dusty boots, the colours also look nice and natural. Costner narrates the film too and I wasn't sure that he needed to, it might have been more interesting to figure out for ourselves what the character was thinking and feeling. The story that develops is one of at first reluctant and then later great friendship and trust between the Costner character as a lonely solider manning an outpost and the local Indian tribe nearby. The film takes great care to show us the culture and individual attributes and traits of the characters in the tribe and you really come to like many of them, you also like the Costner character a very resourceful and plucky guy. The film never gets too sweet and mushy though, there's a great deal of patience to it, communication and building trust takes time and it's not always easy, misunderstandings and mishaps can be common. There is a trilling scene showing a buffalo hunt which is perhaps the standout of the movie, it's one of great spectacle. The film doesn't show all native Americans as simply peaceful and wise, another tribe in flashbacks and the present commits attacks and atrocities and you know there's going to be a big showdown at the end. By this point you've totally forgotten it's not the late 19th century, it's so real, the art direction and costumes are excellent, everything has a worn used look to it. Over time our hero also become the hero in the eyes of the Indians he's befriended and gets a new name and goes so far as to become almost native. There's lovely scenes of camp fires late into the night where characters exchange stories and reminisce. We also have a gentle inquisitive wolf in the story and it was great to see a time when real animals were still used in movies and not CGI birds and bears. There's romance too with Costner falling for a white woman taken in by the tribe when after she became an orphan. Where the film starts not to work is where after a superb scene that gently hints at the decline of the natives with Costner telling them more white people will come than there are stars in the sky and the reminder of the Spanish conquest of the land centuries earlier. The film really should end here but it goes on instead for another 30 minutes. Costner returns to his base only to find if full of petty, bigoted, jingoistic men, crude and uneducated. All the subtle distinctions given to the natives is not applied here. There's a sort of rescue mission though, the natives flee to the mountains, in a scene I couldn't believe the rest of the army then sets off after Costner, I really doubt he'd be their top priority at that time. Overall though a very good film, spoiled by that final 30 minutes."
Dances with Wolves (1990),A Beautiful Tale Set on the Western Frontier in Post Civil War America,"First Lieutenant John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) has his leg injured during the Civil War in 1863. Choosing suicide over losing his leg, Dunbar, grabs a steer (Cisco) and rides toward the Confederate front lines, serving as a distraction in the process. Dunbar's supposed heroics are awarded with medical care and an option to be stationed elsewhere. John chooses to be stationed as far into the American frontier as possible. Awaiting John is an abandoned fort where his only company (so it seems) is his horse, Cisco & a wolf he named Two Socks. Weeks turn to months as John begins to earn the trust of a nearby Sioux tribe. This truly is a beautiful tale of the western frontier in 1860s America. 9/10 would highly recommend."
Dances with Wolves (1990),Sympathetic View of Native American Culture Occasionally Veers into Hagiographical and Anachronistic Territory,"""Dances with Wolves"" has garnered acclaim for its endeavor to present a more sympathetic view of Native American culture within the Western genre. Nevertheless, criticisms abound, with some asserting that the film veers into idealization and hagiography, simplifying the complexities of Native American cultures and histories into noble stereotypes. Kevin Costner's character, John Dunbar, further draws scrutiny as a potential ""white savior"" figure, eclipsing the opportunity for a Sioux character to assume the primary perspective. The film, a significant cultural production challenging prevailing stereotypes, underscores the ongoing need for accurate and nuanced representations of Indigenous peoples in media. A notable flaw in the film lies in its oversight of accurately representing gender differences in dialogue. Russell Means, a prominent Native American activist during that period, found amusement in Kevin Costner's portrayal, as he observed the actor speaking in a manner that inadvertently incorporated a feminine dialect. This oversight became a source of unintended humor for Means, highlighting a noteworthy inaccuracy in the film's linguistic portrayal of Native American characters. The character of John Dunbar in ""Dances with Wolves"" has been subject to discussions regarding whether he can be seen as an anachronistic representation, projecting contemporary white guilt about the mistreatment of Native Americans onto a historical character. Some argue that Dunbar's sympathetic and idealized portrayal reflects modern sensibilities more than the attitudes of the time in which the film is set. His rapid integration into the Lakota Sioux community and the central role he plays in their lives raise questions about the believability of his character within the context of the film's historical setting. The ensemble of Sioux characters, including Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), Ten Bears (Floyd Red Crow Westerman), and Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell), contributes to the film's richness. Each character offers insights into different facets of Sioux culture, presenting a mosaic that reflects the challenges faced by Native American communities during the era of westward expansion. Stands With a Fist's role as a translator and eventual love interest for Dunbar adds a unique perspective to the cultural clashes depicted. ""Dances with Wolves"" has been criticized for its portrayal of the Pawnee as antagonists, as it perpetuates a simplistic and often negative stereotype of this Native American tribe. While the film depicts conflicts between the Sioux and the Pawnee, it's important to note that historical relationships between Native American tribes were complex, and no single narrative can accurately capture the diverse interactions and dynamics. In historical reality, intertribal conflicts were common among Native American groups. The Pawnee did face challenges from various neighboring tribes, including the Sioux, but it's an oversimplification to label one tribe as solely victims or villains. These interactions were shaped by factors such as competition for resources, territorial disputes, and cultural differences. The portrayal of the Pawnee as aggressors in ""Dances with Wolves"" reflects the film's adherence to certain Western genre conventions, where conflict and tension are often framed in clear-cut terms of heroes and villains. However, historical accuracy and nuance are often sacrificed for the sake of cinematic storytelling. The film's depiction of the Sioux as victims reflects a deliberate narrative choice, spotlighting the detrimental impact of westward expansion on Native American communities. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexity of historical events, such as the Dakota War of 1862, which, although not directly part of the film's narrative, adds layers to the discussion. The conflict involved some Dakota Sioux, frustrated by broken treaties, unfair treatment, and starvation, engaged in violent uprisings against white settlers and U. S. government authorities, underscoring the multifaceted nature of historical intertribal dynamics. While ""Dances with Wolves"" is often praised for its attempt to offer a more sympathetic portrayal of Native American characters, discussions about its representation of white characters, particularly soldiers, highlight the need for more nuanced and balanced portrayals in historical storytelling. In ""Dances with Wolves,"" Kevin Costner delivers a performance that adheres to the Hollywood hero mold, embodying the transformational journey of a protagonist caught between cultures during a pivotal period in American history. While his portrayal may not deviate significantly from traditional hero archetypes, the film's enduring impact is buoyed by its remarkable cinematography and a captivating musical score."
Dances with Wolves (1990),A surprisingly good film,"I had never previously watched this film although it has been out for over 30 years at this point. However, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the film greatly. There's not many dramatic moments in the film, however it is a touching story about a man that finds his place in the world. If you are looking for action and excitement, this might not be for you. I would compare the style of film to those that came later such as 'Brooklyn' where the focus is the subtleties of life, it is reminiscent of a 'coming of age' story. I think the scenery is eye-catching and the relationships explored between animals and humans is thought-provoking. Would recommend."
Dances with Wolves (1990),Boring but pretty,"Kevin Costner's directorial debut, Dances with Wolves, is the exact kind of sweeping epic that Hollywood wasn't really making all that much anymore. A throwback to another time when the Western was king, it's a revisionist text that takes Michael Blake's source novel (from a screenplay he wrote), and makes the West...immensely boring. I was reminded of a lot while watching this, from Terrence Malick's Badlands to John Ford's The Searchers to Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, but it mostly reminded me of simplistic moral fables one tells to children dressed up in grown up clothes and stretched out to four hours. Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) gets injured in a Civil War battle in Tennessee, decides that he'd rather die in a blaze of glory than have his leg cut off, miraculously survives being shot at by Confederate troops, and provides the right kind of distraction for the Union army to take advantage and win the small skirmish. As a reward for his bravery, the general ensures that Dunbar's leg will get fixed up and that he'll get his choice of assignment. His choice ends up being as far West as he's allowed to go into the Plains of the American countryside. Now, I should note that I haven't seen this film in years, and I ended up watching the extended cut which is almost an hour longer than the theatrical cut. I went through the differences at the end of the film as listed online in order to get a grasp of where my problems originated and if they would have been endemic to the theatrical cut, and there's a moment here, when John gets his assignment from Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin) where the commanding officer comes off like this complete loon and ends up shooting himself. It's so brief, incidental to the actual action, and so overdone that it threw me, and I saw that it was added in the extended cut. Keep that sucker on the cutting room floor, Costner. I think it's supposed to show the strain of living out there, but the performance by Chaykin is so self-consciously crazy that it feels out of place. Anyway, Dunbar gets to his assignment of Fort Sedgwick, abandoned and rundown, and he sets out to rebuild it while reestablishing the base. This is, of course, where the Indian tribes begin to get introduced. The first is actually a small group of Pawnee, their leader (Wes Studi), killing the man who drove Dunbar to the fort. It creates this sense of danger in the beginning that Dunbar doesn't understand where he is, heightened by the moment (in the extended cut) where Dunbar takes a group of rotting deer and burns it, creating this stack of smoke that's supposed to be a dangerous sign to someone like the Pawnee, and the editing is confusing implying that the Pawnee see it. However, they only end up attacking the guide, never approaching Dunbar and Fort Sedgwick, and the Pawnee disappear for more than two hours. He's soon visited by a Sioux medicine man, Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), and they begin a very limited communication since neither of them speak each other's language. Kicking Bird convinces his tribe to let him try this communication, and it's these scenes of two cultures meeting that first reminded me of the later The New World before steadily recalling Terrence Malick's long history of using Eden as a motif in his stories. It's kind of cute, but it all gets cut short when Kicking Bird convinces the white woman who's been living with them since she was a child, Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell), and the whole communication thing becomes more of a curio to the story instead of an actual hurdle. He learns Sioux, she relearns English, and you have a romance! But, actually communicating ideas is no longer a challenge. The bulk of the film is this idyllic portrait of Sioux life on the plains, and the extended cut has one moment that I really like that the rest of the film forgets because it was easily excised and interfered with the overall love-fest of the Sioux. An early plot point is that the Sioux are waiting for the buffalo that are late in the season. First of all, why do they care? I would imagine the buffalo are a main source of food and clothing for them, but there's never a sign of starvation or even hunger. It's just a generalized desire to have the buffalo around as presented in the film. Secondly, they take it really badly when they see the discarded corpses of several dozen buffalo on the plains which Dunbar helps them find. They're so mad that, in the reconstituted scene, they scalp the white men who did it and celebrate the kills as Dunbar has his voiceover about how there's still this distance between them. It ends up the only scene that remotely puts the Sioux in a bad light...and it was cut from the theatrical version. This overly idyllic portrait ends up becoming excessively boring, though. That's the main problem. There is no drama. No one is starving. There's no danger from war (though the warriors go off to fight it twice, first against the Utes and second against the Pawnee), but the life of the people left behind are never inconvenienced. It's like a vacation. Their lives are perfect, and perfection ends up kind of boring after a while, and it's all in service of the romance between Dunbar, who gains the name Dances with Wolves when he's observed dancing with a wolf around his fire at Fort Sedgwick, and Stands with a Fist. It's only very late in the film when the Pawnee attack the village itself, but Dunbar is able to get rifles without much trouble, making the fight one-sided and simple. Really, this is a story for children. And it's made all the worse when the Army finally decides to show up at Fort Sedgwick. This is where Costner and Blake go full stereotype and caricature to the point where one unnamed soldier uses the page from Dunbar's journal where he says that he loves Stands with a Fist as toilet paper. That's just ham-fisted right there. Ultimately, my problem with the film is that it's too simplistic a take on the life of the Sioux to be interesting for four hours. There's precious little conflict through large stretches, and when the conflict does come it's either too easily dispatched or too cartoonish to take seriously. Also, Kevin Costner's performance is wooden, his voiceover is stilted, and there's often little contrasts between what he's describing in the voiceover and his performance on screen, talking about big emotions but Costner is just kind of looking around, making it obvious that the voiceover was necessary to tell the story because Costner couldn't carry the emotional realities necessary for the performance on his own. I will say this, though, Costner made a great choice of simply filming outside. It's something I wish more filmmakers would do because it becomes easy to get a pleasant frame by just putting a character in the foreground and the epic sight of the American countryside in the background. It's consistently pretty, and the music by John Barry has some nice themes to it. I didn't hate it. It's pretty. The performances from almost everyone else, especially McDonnell, are pretty good, making Costner's plank of wood reactions to everything slightly less of an issue, and it's got a decent score. I like the idea of the look at the life of the Sioux, even if it doesn't feel terribly realistic, and, again, it looks pretty good. Beating Goodfellas, though? I'm convinced that the actors were just throwing their weight around, happy to award any of their troupe that directed movies that got enough producer attention to get a nomination."
Dances with Wolves (1990),Amazing movie,"Directed and Lead by Kevin Costner. I expected any of those usual movie where Indians adopt a white man and he then becomes the root of their extinction. Or in the end showcasing some brutality or lack of civility. This was nothing like that. A civil war hero, adopting life of a Sioux Indian tribe. Falling in love, living life of a tribal man. Until accidentally coming upon his troops. A war erupts and siding with the red Indians, he assures a victory. The woman who was half white escapes with him to further away, for the sake of the tribes. The white woman falling in love with the whole l white man seemed like a cliche at first, but kinda goes okay with the story."
Dances with Wolves (1990),BEAUTIFUL WESTERN ELEVATED TO MYTHIC STATURE,I watched this again last night after many years. My fourth time including opening night at a packed theater. This viewing was just as fulfilling. A great film that takes great pains for historical accuracy while simultaneously displaying many strong subplots. A love story. A coming of age of a disenchanted combat veteran. The inevitable march of Manifest Destiny and it's tragic results on almost childlike natives. Filmed beautifully with a great score and thrilling action scenes I never consider it's three hour length as excessive. In fact I would gladly watch any ten part mini-series about the daily struggle of this proud group of Sioux in the 1860s. A few things that used to bother me before I realized this is the American film western being presented as myth. The Civil War standoff scene where a Christlike Costner rides back and forth before Rebel sharpshooters without getting a scratch? Maybe the director was establishing that his destiny is to be gained without injury against incredible danger. A metaphor for Manifest Destiny? The scene where the Sioux encircle the Pawnee Chief and simultaneously shoot without bullets hitting anyone on the other side of the circle? Shot from above maybe the circle represents the tribes unique interdependence that makes possible it's survival against nature and even mankind itself? Nobody on the other side of the circle is shot because of that metaphor? Anyway you look at it a great movie and one of my favorite westerns.
Dances with Wolves (1990),"""Nothing I have been told about these people is correct.""","In his directorial debut, Kevin Costner directs a historical landmark, for which Michael Blake wrote both the screenplay and the novel. A speculative screenplay from the early 1980s, which remained unsold. Kevin Costner then encouraged Michael Blake to turn it into a novel to improve its chances of becoming a film. He also purchased the rights, but he and Blake struggled to find a studio and producers before finally striking a deal with Orion Pictures. Kevin Costner and Mary McDonnell then learned the Sioux language for their roles from Doris Leader Charge - Professor of Lakota Language at Sinte Gleska University - who is also part of the cast. The genius of Kevin Costner shines through every shot and line of dialogue, which pays homage to magnificent natural settings and their history, as well as to people of good faith. All those who have opened their heart and mind to learn from each other, with respect for Mother Earth and under the guidance of the Great Spirit. An artistic genius extended to the entire cast and crew who all shone in their exceptional and historic performances. Dean Semler's superb cinematography and the performances mentioned above inspired John Barry to compose one of the most epic compositions in his rich filmography. The performances, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography and production values were praised, and 'Dances with Wolves' also became a box office success, the biggest success in the history of Orion Pictures. A pure artistic genius who was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director for Kevin Costner, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score and for Best Sound Mixing. Other numerous accolades around the world also include the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Film. 'Dances With Wolves' is considered a major influence in the revitalization of the Western film genre. And it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" in 2007."
Dances with Wolves (1990),Kevin Costner masterpiece,"Personally this movie was good and bad. It had very good and eye-catching moments while others were a snooze fest. My least favorite part was when he was taken by the Americans, and they shot Two Socks. The best part was when the Indians attacked the Americans to recuse John Dunbar. Even John Dunbar fought and it was a very intense battle. From him almost dying, to Smiles a lot putting a ax in the opponents heart. At the end John finds love with Stands With a Fist, and Two Socks return. Overall I enjoyed this because it was hooking towards the end. Kevin Costner also deserves a Oscar for that,"
Legends of the Fall (1994),Superbly acted and handsome looking but it feels like watching a hack Mills & Boons novel having been brought to life,"In the early half of the Twentieth Century, in Montana, Colonel William Ludlow raises his three sons, Tristan, Alfred, and Samuel. Samuel. Who is the youngest and is engaged to marry Sussanah who he brings to meet his family on their farm. When World War I takes hold of the globe, Samuel sets out to fight in the conflict, with his ever-protective brothers following him into combat. When Samuel is killed, Samuel and Tristan return home after completing their tours of duty. However, on returning both men themselves fall in love with Susannah, and the conflict that arises threatens to tear their family apart. An American period drama very much in the vein of some of the classic melodramas of the golden age of cinema. Legends of the Fall has that old-fashioned tonal feel that invites comparisons with movies like East of Eden, as well as Gone with the Wind. Directed by Edward Zwick, who let's be fair has had an overall patchy career with The Last Samurai arguably being his closest work to reaching classic status. Comprising of an overall decent cast that includes veteran Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, Henery Thomas, and Julia Ormond who at the time was practically unknown, and who has unfortunately dwindled into practical obscurity. It's headed by Brad Pitt, who although not a terrible actor has been nothing more than an acceptable leading man and screen presence. Albeit at least a charismatic one. The plot which is to be charitable is irrevocably contrived and relies on us swallowing the conceit that all three of the brothers of the story, played by Pitt, Quinn, and Thomas fall for the same woman. An unlikely setup for sure, but it's one that writers Susan Shilliday, William D. Wittliff, and Jim Harrison ask us are determined to sell to the audience. The character of One Stab, a Native American who is Colonel Ludlow's most loyal and trusted friend whom he employs on his farm, acts as the narrator for the movie. Imparting the events in Ludlow's life that have forced him to raise his three boys without the presence of their mother who has parted company with him. He describes the contrasting personalities of each with Alfred being the level-headed one, with a maturity beyond his years. Tristan is the more, free-spirited impetuous one while Samuel's is more unassuming, idealistic, and naive. Within this dynamic, we see despite their differing natures, the closeness and solidarity the brothers have which as the story unfolds, makes the tragedy of its plot all the more poignant and tragic. Hopkins crusty, seasoned old Colonel who makes no bones about his disapproval of Samuel's idealism, and his resolve to go to war is ultimately left helpless as his sons leave for the trenches of France. Forced to play host to his figurative baby son's fiance who is ultimately left behind to pick up some of the pieces of her would-be husband's demise. It's no exaggeration to say that Legends of the Fall is a handsomely laid-out movie, with gorgeous production values and stunning cinematography. From the picturesque rural backdrop of the Ludlow homestead to the war-torn, mud-drenched trenches and No Man's Land the period detail is startingly brought to life. It can't completely compensate for an overly sensationalized tonality, despite the best efforts of its cast to reign things in. Hopkins as the patriarch and figurehead of the Ludlow family is a casting choice that is perfectly on the nose, with his commanding authority belying a softer center under his tough exterior. Pitt as I've said before although not the worst of actors, although far from the best is on strong form here in a role that plays to his strengths as a charismatic leading man while Aidan Quinn is a bold contrast as Tristan's more level headed, prudent and more reserved brother Alfred. Ormond who up until this point was more unknown, at least outside of the UK delivers the goods in what might have at the time been her career making role. However, for all the handsome cinematography, solid turns for it's decent cast and superb production fans, I couldn't help but feel I was watching a hack Mills & Boons novel being brought to life. The plot after all does stretch credulity to some degree, while it lapses into histrionics. The plot twist of Pitt marrying the considerably younger daughter of One Stab, who Alfred quite rightly describes as inappropriate considering she had been like a younger sister to the three male siblings growing up just doesn't quite ring true. Although this may be coming from a position of resentment and jealousy from Alfred, who bitter at the favoritism his father and youngest brother Samuel have shown toward Tristan. He nevertheless has a point. The Legends of the Fall is overall forgettable fodder from director Zwick, who for all the sheen and polish he gives the movie, can't compensate for its narrative shorting comings and its penchant for melodrama. On a technical level its consummately crafted but the heavy handedness of its storytelling leaves something to be desired and it's thanks in no small part ot its cast, that they managed to be the glue that holds the movie together as well as Zwicks assured direction. At over two hours in length it passes the time and just manages to not out say it's welcome. But not long after it has ended you'll be hard pressed to remember it."
Legends of the Fall (1994),the fall from an imaginary paradise,"On the occasion of watching 'Legends of the Fall' (1994) directed by Edward Zwick, I found out an interesting piece of trivia related to the title of the film. 'Fall' in the title refers to the fall from Paradise. However in several versions in other languages (including French and Romanian) 'Fall' has been translated as autumn. Wrong, because this film it's not about autumn at all. It rather tells one of those great American stories that takes place on a ranch at America's frontier, a story of the fall from a Paradise that may not have existed ever except in the romanticized image of the pioneers of the West to the harsh realities of the American society in the first half of the 20th century. It is also a story about family, about fathers who disown their sons and brothers who come to hate each other, and of course it all starts and revolves around a mesmerizingly beautiful woman. All the makings of a great movie, but... The Ludlow family. Colonel William Ludlow knew America's wars of the late 19th century: the Civil War and the Indian Wars. Disgusted by the actions of the army and the government towards the Indians, he throws down his sword (literally, in a scene that is meant to be symbolic), retires from the army and settles on a huge ranch somewhere in the West with a faithful servant and with a Cree Indian friend and his family. The colonel has three sons who are very different between them: Albert who is respectful of the laws and integrates well within the system, Tristan the handsome, rebellious and wild one, and Samuel the idealist. The colonel's wife cannot stand the harsh life and climate of the West and leaves for the East Coast. Samuel brings home from his studies a young orphan girl of captivating beauty named Susannah to whom he becomes engaged. All four men, each in his own way, will fall under her spell. The First World War breaks out, the idealistic Samuel and the careerist Albert decide to volunteer for the front in the Canadian army (the United States had not yet entered the war). Tristan is not as enthusiastic, but he also enlists to defend Sam, the younger brother. When Sam falls on the front, the two surviving brothers will become rivals for the girl remained alone. Their rivalry tears apart the family and the father's heart and will last for decades. The story is told in flashbacks by One Stab, the family's devoted Indian friend who will outlive them all. A bit too much off-screen voiceover for my taste, especially since the visuals are suggestive enough themselves. John Toll even won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1995, the only Academy Award won by the film. The story spans the historical periods from the turn of the century to the Prohibition era and has all the elements of a historical saga, but with too much emphasis on melodrama. There is no lack of emotional elements, but they are a little too obvious. The drama does, however, provide the opportunity for some solid acting creations. Anthony Hopkins pulls off another one of those formidable roles where he manages to create yet another distinct and memorable character while still being himself (with nobility and verticality). Julia Ormond here gives one of the best roles of a career that, while not yet over, seems to have had its peak in that period of her youth. Finally, Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt - a lavish role, in which he can display all his charm and talent, but in which he still seemed a bit monotonous to me, without changing much in the two decades full of dramatic or even tragic events that his hero goes through. The conflict between Colonel Lundlow and Tristan on the one side and the rest of the characters and society on the other side alludes to an anti-government libertarianism that sounded better in 1995 than it does today. ""Legends of the Fall"" is closer to the classic westerns than to the films that look more critically at the American history of those times. Because of this idealistic approach, the film not only looks a little dated today, but I think it has looked aged since the time when it was released."
Legends of the Fall (1994),One of the greatest movies of all time,"This is a truly wonderful movie from start to finish, and I cannot recommend this movie enough to everyone I meet. I loved the tension between the three brothers, the love stories intertwined, the performances that Hopkins and Pitt turn in, the score, the cinematography, the horses, the war scenes - it's all literally so great that I consider it to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It's easy to see how Pitt became a worldwide sensation after this movie. Hopkins is just awesome! I love it when he shouts screw the government and tells the government that it's business is supposed to be public. Again, I'd you're thinking about watching this movie, grab the popcorn and dial in. You won't be disappointed."
Legends of the Fall (1994),A Terrible Movie Full Of Terrible People,"I watched this the first time as a kid and was like ""meh"". Watched it again as an adult and it was even worse. I normally adore Anthony Hopkins but he was bland and colorless in this film. Anachronisms abound and I spent the entire 2+ hours either bored or mad. The acting was unengaging with the exception of Gordon Tootoosis' One Stab - I thought he was great and did the best he could with what the writers gave him. For the most part the characters were all horrible people and deserved what they got, except for poor Isabel II, who didn't know any better than to love an unlovable man. Her death was the only one that saddened me. If you're looking for a historical drama there are so many others that are fantastic. This movie was snubbed for acting Oscars for a reason. I will say the cinematography was fantastic and deserving of the movie's sole Oscar win."
Legends of the Fall (1994),Purely awesome,"One of the greatest role for Brad Pitt, even now in 2023. He literally robs the show with this borderline character, war vet suffering of post war traumatic disorder; it's impossible not to be attracted by him, to feel empathy for him, a so poignant and lost in advance character. One terrific, outstanding family drama that could have given a mini series, or a series with several seasons, why not? One of the best film from director Edward Zwick. Great photography, scenery, outdoor settings, splendid landscapes. It is a jaw dropping and gloomy, sad tale but no depressing though. An important family drama masterpiece as powerful as GIANT. And Brad Pitt dies the same way Leonardo Di Caprio in THE REVENANT."
Legends of the Fall (1994),2nd BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"It's baffles me that I got to find this movie out today after hitting the age of 34!! Such a good story telling, so much so that I'd consider it the second best movie Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt each ever did. And probably the best movie the rest of the cast ever did in their whole damn career. Mind you, I can't give it 10/10 because of the following:
 Director Edward Zwick has a knack of bringing in tragedy to make a great film, which isn't always true. As we've seen in this movie, many unneeded death and despair we portrayed and it tends to stray away from the main storyline at times. The revolving reasons and plots could've been written better as seen in the director's later movie after this masterpiece. The rough and tough hero haven't been showcased enough to show what he actually got or capabled of. It would've been more enjoyable to close the movie on a lighter note after all the painful events we experienced and endured through. The end scene deserves an elated moment instead of closing with one sorrow after the other."
Legends of the Fall (1994),"""Legends of the Fall"" is an epic that continues to captivate audiences with its visual beauty, stunning performances and emotional depth","""Legends of the Fall"" is a film set in the north of the United States, in mountainous Montana, which begins in 1900 and ends exactly in 1963. Therefore, we immediately realize what we are in for: a long-running epic, which spans six decades in life of the Ludlow family, but also the history of the country itself. This cinematic epic, set in the vast landscapes of Montana, is a story of love, war and tragedy that captivated audiences with its stunning images, moving performances and gripping narrative. In the plot, we meet the Ludlows. The father is Colonel William Ludlow (great Anthony Hopkins, as always, even when he has a heart attack and abuses his grimaces and fake limps), a decorated officer who leaves the army disenchanted with the institution and builds a ranch in Montana with the help from his faithful Native American friend, Pet (Tantoo Cardinal) - it is precisely he who will be the narrator of this story. The woman, little accustomed to the harsh weather of Montana, decides to return to the city and Ludlow is the one who raises the three children: Tristan (Brad Pitt), a free spirit who grows up almost like an Indian and who fights with a bear in an episode that will mark the rest of your life; Alfred (Aidan Quinn), the responsible middle child; and Samuel (Henry Thomas), the youngest and, therefore, the family's protege. When bringing back to their father's (Anthony Hopkins) ranch a beautiful young woman (Julia Ormond), Samuel's fiancée, the brothers fall in love with her and begin a conflict of passions that could end in tragedy for their family. In the midst of this dilemma, the brothers end up becoming rivals, having to live in the best way possible, with the eternal blood ties that unite them, discovering that because of him, they would never be able to stop loving each other, regardless of any situation that may arise. Occur to them. However, we cannot say that it is exactly a very imaginative argument. It's just that ""Legends of the Fall"" doesn't ask for permission to abuse coincidences to advance an argument, which uses melodrama and shameful tragedy as fuel. It's more of a serial than an epic, at times, in which director Edward Zwick likes to highlight the melodramatic parts. He never gets to the knife or bowl, but he is close by often. Be that as it may, it is of this grandeur that these enormous frescoes of America signed by Hollywood are made. It's only surprising that one hasn't appeared since Cold Mountain, as it has always been a very specific tradition in North American cinema. The plot will go to the First World War, in the trenches of France, as the three brothers will enlist in the British army after a patriotic outburst (and where Brad Pitt will transform into a bloodthirsty hero, killing everyone with a knife) ; Brad Pitt will also have the opportunity to travel the world, on an anthropological adventure; it will also explore the alcohol prohibition that marked a period in the country; and he will still have political touches, although always on a high, very high level, when Alfred enters the race for Congress. However, none of this is more interesting than the relationships between the brothers and Susannah and between Tristan and the other characters. After all, Tristan is the main character of the film and the central figure around whom all the others revolve. What drives the film is the desire for the strange city woman, all refined, with a different perspective from that experienced in the countryside. When faced with the unusual situation and the beauty of Julia Ormond, all the brothers are enchanted, and no wonder. The greed of all the brothers comes to the surface exactly at this moment, and it is a greed that does not stop. What is the limit of a desire? As much as the woman loves Samuel, her uncontrollable desire for the wild Tristan, a mysterious man with an unexpected and different life for the lady of civilization, never ends. Sometimes true love can give way to quick desire, the difference is the amount of happiness it can offer you or it can give you an illusion to provide. When desiring love from others, there is no more guilt, no more shame. Betrayal is an easy barrier to break if the will is not fulfilled quickly, while desire boils in the bowels. It's a dangerous thing that can turn lifelong relationships into a cruel feud in the blink of an eye. Tristan is simply the most enigmatic of the three, as well as the best crafted. His wild atmosphere makes him indomitable in his personality. As much as a desire is mutual, he was not born to be a tamed man from a maiden, he was born to be a wild man from nature. This wild characteristic that gives strength to the character of a Brad Pitt who delivers a great performance. He is an unpredictable character. We see the strength of the bond Tristan has with his family from the film. As he was always raised with his wild vision of the countryside and not something courteous in the city, he begins to dislike what comes from her early on. His absent mother is an uninteresting figure in this brave heart's life, because she gave up the world that Tristan cherishes so much. His brother's girlfriend is an interesting woman, but the best thing is to preserve family ties rather than surrender because of a betrayal of the family. And when he begins to see himself with a reserved future, in a city, he runs away to avoid facing a reality he never wanted to face: finding himself trapped, even if he is trapped in a relationship. Susannah, played with strength by an exceptional Julia Ormond, is the film's point of contradiction. Again, as in one of the first chapters of the best-selling book in the world, the woman who brought chaos to the earth in her treacherous and seductive form. But this time it is not the female form that brings misfortune to a family, it is the origin of it. The city corrupted the countryside with its distinct vision. For Susannah, Tristan is what she most covets, her extreme opposite, her inner challenge. There is no grace for her in the man that Alfred is, a man who is actually so similar to her that he even denies her name so that he can live in love and be happy with him. But is happiness mutual? Susannah's desire leaves consequences. Even though Tristan is far away, her consolation is waiting for him in a field, the closest to him that can be. But this desire was more consuming her happiness and drowning her with sorrows than amusing her and giving her pleasure inside. How can you wait for something that won't arrive? Alfred then proposes to be happy, but can she be happy without loving, without living with an already accomplished desire that only grows with each passing day due to the lack of its daily fulfillment? The family appears increasingly important in this passionate impasse that reveals itself in the plot. Samuel is like a link between the two brothers. Even though he is the youngest, both Tristan and Albert come together in the only common interest they have: the protective instinct towards the youngest in the family. The death of this family connection brings death in the family. Albert finally reveals himself to be a politician, something his father despises with all his might since his wartime days. Only Tristan insists on maintaining a love for his family, even if it means abandoning pleasure. The troubled relationship between Aidan Quinn and Anthony Hopkins' characters, both with effective and surprising performances, makes for some good moments in the film. For the rest, he sticks with the script that holds its pace by placing a rivalry between country and city, between love and passion, between family and pleasure, between relationships and instincts. There is also John Toll's photography, which earned the film a deserved Oscar, a magnificent and omnipresent soundtrack by the master James Horner - who three years later would win an Oscar for ""Titanic"" -, and also Edward Zwick's direction. The great strength of ""Legends of the Fall"" lies in its ability to transport us to a world of stunning landscapes and complex characters. The film's photography, which captures the vast plains of Montana in all its colors and seasons, is one of its greatest assets. The beauty of the images serves as a backdrop for the story of love and tragedy that unfolds. The film also touches on deep themes such as family loyalty, loss and the impact of time on people's lives. It's a story about how the choices we make can shape our destinies and how love can be both the source of joy and suffering. However, ""Legends of the Fall"" is not a light film. It deals with heavy and often dark themes, and tragedy is a significant part of the narrative. So prepare yourself for an emotional rollercoaster when watching this film. For all these reasons, ""Legends of the Fall"" is a film that passes quickly, despite its long duration, as it has something for all tastes, awakening different types of emotions and feelings. That doesn't mean it doesn't abuse melodrama and often gets lost unreasonably. However, the solid performances of its cast, a solid period reconstruction and a firm and correct direction create one of the last great Hollywood epics. Having received 3 Oscar nominations at the time, the film was also considered a box office success during its release. The film only had a budget of US$30 million, but it raised around US$160 million at the time. ""Some people listen to their own inner voices and live by what they hear... these people become crazy people or legends"". ""Legends of the Fall"" is an epic that continues to captivate audiences with its visual beauty, stunning performances and emotional depth. It is a story of love, family and tragedy that remains one of the cinematic jewels of the 1990s and is a cinematic experience worth experiencing."
Legends of the Fall (1994),Amazing drama,"Legends of the Fall, a sweeping epic of love and loss, is a cinematic triumph that skillfully blends stunning cinematography, powerhouse acting, and a hauntingly beautiful score. Its strength lies in the raw, emotionally charged performances of its cast, with Brad Pitt's portrayal as Tristan, in particular, leaving an indelible mark. The picturesque landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in cinematography transport viewers to the rugged Montana wilderness, enhancing the storytelling. While it may feel slightly melodramatic at times and suffers from moments of predictability, Legends of the Fall secures an 8/10 for its ability to weave a poignant narrative filled with passion and familial bonds, leaving a lasting emotional impact that resonates long after the credits roll."
Legends of the Fall (1994),Susannah had no business there...,"It's been years since my last watch of this movie, but I can say that I've generally been a fan of it in my younger years. My latest viewing has left me infinitely annoyed by Susannah's presence. Susannah hadn't even made it to the house before she was giving the brothers the eye. When Samuel died, there was literally no reason for her to still be living with his family. She should've been on the first train smoking. The way she carried on, I wonder how she really would've been had she married Samuel. The scene where she visits Tristan in jail is brutal. I can't find it in me to feel bad for what happened between them. Aside from that annoyance, I still love the movie. 90's Pitt is always a plus, and I also enjoyed Hopkins and Quinn."
Legends of the Fall (1994),Sodom and Gomorrah in the beautiful Montana,"It's no wonder Hollywood, the modern day's Sodom and Gomorrah, injected its perversion into the breathtaking scenery of Montana set to glorious music. That's how they condition people to accept this is how things are. One of the 3 brothers shows up with a fiancee and the other two start lusting after her (and she, after one of them). No decency, no respect, no nothing. This is supposed to be set in the early 20th century... and there's an implied an*l sex scene between the woman and her fiance's brother!... I understand now why these movies never sat right with me. Friendly warning: you better start noticing the way Hollywood movies are used to make degeneracy OK."
Blazing Saddles (1974),"Blazing Saddles (1975): A Wild, Irreverent Comedy That Pushes Boundaries - A Classic Mel Brooks Masterpiece!","Blazing Saddles, directed by Mel Brooks, is a comedic tour de force that fearlessly pushes boundaries and challenges societal norms. With its irreverent humor, memorable characters, and razor-sharp satire, this film has rightfully earned its place as a classic in the comedy genre. The headline ""A Wild, Irreverent Comedy That Pushes Boundaries - A Classic Mel Brooks Masterpiece!"" perfectly encapsulates the essence of Blazing Saddles. From its opening scenes, this film sets out to break convention and defy expectations. Brooks fearlessly tackles topics of racism, stereotypes, and political correctness, using satire and absurdity to expose societal flaws and ignite laughter. The film's premise revolves around the corrupt politicians of Rock Ridge, who devise a plan to drive the townspeople away by appointing a black sheriff, Bart, played brilliantly by Cleavon Little. Little's performance is a standout, bringing charm, wit, and a sense of resilience to the role. His chemistry with the quick-witted and eccentric Jim, played by Gene Wilder, adds an extra layer of comedic brilliance to the film. Blazing Saddles is known for its rapid-fire jokes, puns, and innuendos that leave no stone unturned. The humor can be crude, controversial, and even offensive at times, but it serves a greater purpose - to expose the absurdity of prejudice and challenge societal norms. The film's ability to make us laugh while tackling serious subjects is a testament to Brooks' genius as a comedic storyteller. The ensemble cast of Blazing Saddles is a true delight, with memorable performances from Harvey Korman as the bumbling and conniving politician Hedley Lamarr, Madeline Kahn as the seductive and clueless Lili Von Shtupp, and Slim Pickens as the loyal and dim-witted Taggart. Their comedic timing and commitment to their roles elevate the film and deliver laugh-out-loud moments throughout. Mel Brooks' direction is bold and unapologetic. He seamlessly blends various comedic styles, from slapstick and physical comedy to satirical wordplay, creating a unique and dynamic experience. The film's iconic scenes, such as the bean-eating contest and the unforgettable campfire scene, have become legendary in comedy history. While Blazing Saddles may not be for everyone due to its edgy humor and controversial subject matter, it remains a landmark film that paved the way for future comedies to challenge societal norms and push boundaries. Its impact on the genre cannot be understated, as it continues to inspire filmmakers and comedians to take risks and tackle sensitive issues through humor. With its clever writing, memorable characters, and fearless approach to satire, Blazing Saddles has stood the test of time. Its ability to make audiences laugh while addressing serious social issues is a testament to its brilliance. While some jokes may feel dated or offensive to a modern audience, it is important to view them within the context of the film's satirical intentions. In conclusion, Blazing Saddles is a wild, irreverent comedy that pushes boundaries and challenges societal norms. With Mel Brooks at the helm and a stellar ensemble cast, the film delivers laughs, thought-provoking moments, and a unique blend of satire and absurdity. While not without its flaws, it remains a classic Mel Brooks masterpiece that continues to entertain and spark important conversations. A must-watch for fans of comedy that pushes the limits and dares to be different."
Blazing Saddles (1974),An absolute comedy classic: A must watch.,"Blazing Saddles is easily one of the greatest comedy films ever made, and many of the jokes still hold up 50 years later. The acting is brilliant from all, Mel Brooks proves in this film that he's a talented comic actor as well as a brilliant comic filmmaker. The script and story are inventive and well-done, especially for a comedy film. Nothing feels like it drags on for too long, the pacing is great throughout. The whole ending which is one huge fourth wall break always gets an enormous amount laughs out of me. It's a good satire of racism and western films and their various cliches. Hard to fault, so it's a 10 out of 10 from me."
Blazing Saddles (1974),One of the funniest films ever made,"Blazing Saddles is not only the finest Mel Brooks film, it's one of the finest comedies of all time. However it's not for the easily offended, this film was released in 1974 and contains attitudes of the time. Looking past all that it's a great comedy with a broad range of humour and interesting characters. I rewatched it 3 days ago and was surprised how well it held up. It's pacing is comparatively quite slow compared to modern comedies, but it's far better than them so it doesn't affect your experience. The acting is great too. It also still looks pretty good visually. If you love old-school humour, you can't go wrong with this film."
Blazing Saddles (1974),A Hilarious and Irreverent Western Spoof,"Blazing Saddles is not only a comedy, but also a satire that exposes the hypocrisy and bigotry of society. The movie shows how Bart, as a black sheriff, faces discrimination and hostility from both the townspeople and the villains. He uses his intelligence and wit to overcome the obstacles and win their respect. The movie also mocks the stereotypes and clichés of the western genre, such as the noble hero, the damsel in distress, the ruthless villain, and the epic showdown. The movie subverts these tropes and makes fun of them in clever ways. This is a movie that will make you laugh out loud and think at the same time. It is a masterpiece of comedy that has stood the test of time and remains relevant today. It is one of Mel Brooks' best works and one of the funniest movies ever made. If you have not seen it yet, you are missing out on a great experience. Blazing Saddles is a movie that you will never forget."
Blazing Saddles (1974),Brilliant,"When a railroad needs to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge, crooked Hedley Lamarr seeks to pressure the population to leave so that he can buy their land cheap. He does this by sending a black sheriff to the deeply racist town. How times have changed. At the time, all the attention for this film focussed on the farting scene. Half a century later, the very frequent use of the n-word is downright shocking. But it remains brilliant observational satire, well ahead of its time. And this film is just very, very funny, with a fantastic script and great performances from all the principal cast members. It has worn well, and is as clever and funny as it always was."
Blazing Saddles (1974),Enjoy the Ride,"Way back in the 1970's a man called Mel made a movie about the law, racism, governmental corruption, sexism, animal cruelty and inappropriate table manners. It was friggin hilarious. We used to be able to laugh at these things, I thinks most of us with any sense still do . We understand the concept of humor. We understand that by making fun of the things we find repugnant we lessen their importance
Brooks understood this. He was a master at tearing into our darker impulses and making them look petty and foolish , all the while making us laugh
This his masterpiece. Sit back, grab your favorite snack and enjoy the ride Blazing Saddles is a gem."
Blazing Saddles (1974),Painfully dated and not very funny anymore.,"This is a film that I now find painful to watch. I used to love this film but after watching today it really has dated so badly. The padding is so obvious. Mel Brookes parts always weren't good. His ego couldn't allow him not to be in his films. Unfortunately his talents were off screen rather than on. The parts Richard Pryor wrote are obvious and still funny. There's a schism between the Pryor parts and Brookes. They've always been there but even more obvious today. It's not the vocabulary that makes the film dated, it's just about everything. Yes there are some very funny parts. But they makes less than 20% of the film. It was always a weakness to only have Gene in the film for less than an hour. He carries the film when he's on screen. When he isn't then it's interminable. I feel such a traitor by saying these things. Sadly this is a film that just isn't that funny anymore."
Blazing Saddles (1974),Doesn't work as well nearly 50 years later,"I am going to be greatly in the minority here. I sheepishly admit to having seen this in 1974 and not once since until last night. I had very high expectations and remembered some funny things about it, but the funny things that I remembered are nearly all that still seem humorous to me. This was bold and brave, politically incorrect and outrageous 49 years ago, but many of the jokes Are very dated and almost not a bit of it is particularly outrageous today. It has a well known cast of comedians from that era and they are all doing their familiar shtick that is now more nostalgic than funny, though I did smile a lot for a while. This is a comedy classic, but for me, it no longer works all that well. Mel Brooks is a funny guy and made some very good movies, particularly young Frankenstein, put much of the humor here is from the Catskills days. It certainly had its moment in time, but sad to say, the sun has set on this somewhat."
Blazing Saddles (1974),A comedy classic that is problematic today,"Many people say you couldn't make this movie today, and you are right. They can't. The gratuitously use of racial slurs (even though the movie had it right on racism), the use of ""rape"" as a punchline for several jokes, all of this simply would not fly today. But other problems abound. First, the thing that it is parodying would be lost on modern audiences that never really got to see the ""Clean, wholesome western"" that predominated the movie scene between the 1930's and the 1950's. By the time ""Saddles"" came out, they were largely superseded by the gritty ""Spaghetti Westerns"" or similar movies that questioned our relationships with western expansion. There's one joke where Sheriff Bart says, ""You'd do it for Randolph Scott"", but does anyone today remember who Randolph Scott even was? Much the same with the jokes around the name of Harvey Korman's villain. Similarly, some gags don't work because in the years since, they've been done to death. I give you the campfire scene. This was probably the first movie that even acknowledged the existence of flatulence. But now Fart Jokes are considered a cheap laugh. So is it still funny? Yes, in parts. But I think it's overrated in some ways."
Blazing Saddles (1974),It couldn't be made today...,"... and that's a crying shame. This film stands as a timeless classic that fearlessly tackles sensitive subjects with wit, audacity, and an unapologetic sense of humor that would never allow it to be made today. Cleavon Little shines as Bart, a black railroad worker who finds himself appointed as the first black sheriff in a racist town. Alongside the brilliant Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid, Bart navigates a web of absurdity, delivering one-liners and slapstick moments with impeccable comedic timing. The film's strength lies in its fearless approach to taboo subjects. From racial jokes to lampooning Hollywood conventions, ""Blazing Saddles"" breaks through social barriers to expose and mock the absurdity of prejudice and intolerance. By pushing the boundaries of what's considered acceptable comedy, the film forces viewers to confront their own biases and laugh at the absurdity of prejudice. The script, co-written by Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor, is a masterclass in comedy writing. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and laden with clever wordplay and innuendos. It ultimately attacks racism and racists by making both appear to be what they are - stupid."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),The man with no name is back.,"This is a film about two bounty hunters whose paths cross one day way back in the old west. The film holds onto a few features of it's previous one, the grainy look, the bad dubbing, the frayed and worn costumes, the low and interesting camera angles, another great introduction to Eastwood's character who this time enters a saloon on a rainy night to retrieve his prize, he's a cold and detached character who doesn't mind blowing a few men away to get rich. The punch effects are still over the top like someone breaking a table in half or something, the film retains though a real rough unpolished look which combines well with it's stylish music and action. The music is good in this one again and there's even a little organ music too which surprised me. The film is still low budget but I loved the costumes, the landscape and the dry humour in the film. The picture is widescreen and the blu ray comes with good picture and sound quality. Eastwood continues to fascinate as this tall handsome strange man with no past. This is not a gory film, in fact some characters are shot dead at point blank range with no blood. Eastwood sort of takes a bit of a backseat in this film though, Lee Van Cleef is really great in his role and the one they end up going after together is a real villain. There is one scene though that's really poor where a woman who's being attacked by a man in bed shoots herself when she could quite easily have killed him instead which you think might have been more likely but there you go. I have go give this film a lot of praise though for it's music, costumes, characters, landscapes, production design and direction. All in all very satisfying and an improvement over the first one."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),For real this time,"Ok then. I have seen this movie before, but I don't remember when. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I can't dislike the dollars trilogy. I just can't. I still think The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the best of them. Fistful is not bad, it's a 6/10. Same as for example Bad Taste, Army Of Darkness, Evil Dead 2, Terminator 2, original Robocop and Predator. All people cannot love, and are allowed to, not love the exact same films. I do know however when my opinion of this and that comes from inside. I do believe that when I saw Once Upon A Time In The West, I like it better. I guess maybe italian spaghetti westerns just isn't for everyone. I doubt without the music anyone would even remember them. It's a matter of personal thinking. Personal taste."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),An instant classic who felt Westerns did not have enough action,"(1965) For A Few Dollars More/ Per qualche dollaro in più
DUBBED
WESTERN/ ACTION/ COMEDY After the success of ""A Fistful of Dollars"", director Leone received more money for this second effort and the experience is somewhat of a masterpiece! Like director John Woo making films in Hong Kong, Leone watches other films and borrows specific scenes from other films and makes them better, in this case some came from ""High Noon"", ""Vera Cruz"" and ""The Bravados"" and at the same time makes those scenes as his own turning the whole experience as original as they come! Simplistic story about two bounty hunters going after a ruthless gang! With a little mystery leaving no clues until the final! Leone's trademark is plastered throughout topping the film of course with Ennio Morricone's brilliant musical score! Footnote: Excellent scene by scene analysis from 'film Historian' Sir Christopher Frayling from DVD."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),Make it again and spend a Few Dollars More.,"For A Few Dollars More (2?) (1965) - In a fight my money was on Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer. He was definitely the better character in this film, although I did like the interactions between him and Clint Eastwood as Monco. I would have liked to have seen more scuffles and action in it though. It all seemed to be saved up for the end, which caused it to drag a bit, especially for someone who wouldn't choose a western as their first genre to watch, although with that said, I have been surprised by a number of them lately and I actually thought that this one had the better story and delivery over 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' (1966), which is the one that tends to appear on more of the top film lists. Some of the supporting characters were a bit corny and badly dubbed, which let things down somewhat, but Gian Maria Volontè was quite sexy in his role of El Indio. His stoned out weirdness was really hard to deal with however and didn't necessarily add to his part. It took a long time to really get in to things with the story. By the time Clint and Lee met and decided to work together and then went after their bounty, I felt that it had been a whole film already, not for the content, but for the length of the set up. I was glad that there wasn't a larger romantic element though, because I find that can ruin a good cowboy film. I did wish that there had been more action and less of the ""Drama"" however, because the two lead characters would have lent themselves more to that sort of gunslinging and body count type of film, rather than the buddy picture that this almost turned in to. Finally I would say that some of the background music was absolutely awful and went right through me. It was incredibly piercing at times and not really that necessary at all. It wasn't a bad film of its type and I preferred Clint here than in some of his others. When 'Magnificent Seven' (1960) was remade in 2016, I wondered if we would see a plethora of western revival's and I certainly felt that this story would be worth a revisit, just with a slight polish and a modern look at delivering it as something artistic and thoughtful instead of something churned out for box office figures. 617.89/1000."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),Sensational Morricone score,"Ennio Morricone's score is enthralling:- an angelic, soaring ethereal female chorus accompanied by silver triangles and deep bassoon. His ''Ecstasy of Gold'' in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1968) is equally as inspiring. Another Italian maestro- Piero Piccioni also composed a thrilling 'hairs-stand-on-the-back-of-your-neck' opening score for the adventure film, The Light at the Edge of the World (1971) starring Kirk Douglas, Fernando Rey and Yul Brynner, showing just how talented those Italian composers in the '60s/70s were. London's Time Out Film Guide refers to Clint Eastwood's '..super-cool, taciturn gun-slinger' and '.... Morricone's terrific score'. When interviewed by the B. B. C. In 1989 relating to a tribute programme dedicated to Leone and Lee Van Cleef, English film expert, Christopher Grayling explained that Leone wanted to conjure a kind of 'flamboyant rhetoric' to transcend the traditional Hollywood oater. And that he had originally wanted that most rhythmic of US actors - lanky, silver-haired, toothy, James Coburn - as the character played by Eastwood."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),Sergio Leone getting more experience in making Spaghetti Westerns,"After reviewing ""A fistfull of dollars"" (1964, Sergio Leone) it is hard to write something new about ""For a few dollars more"" (1965, Sergio Leone), the second episode of the ""Dollar -"" or ""Man with no name"" trilogy. The same characteristics (much violence, frequent close ups, shootouts drawn out in long takes) are present. Because Leone had somewhat more experience the story is somewhat more complex and longer. In effect every episode of the trilogy lasted approximately half an hour longer (""A fistfull of dollars"" 99 minutes, ""For a few dollars more"" 132 minutes and finally ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" 161 minutes. The major innovation of this film is introducing a second lead character in the form of Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef). Lee van Cleef had ample experience in classic (not spaghetti) Westerns like ""High Noon"" (1952, Fred Zinnemann) and ""The man who shot Liberty Valance"" (1962, John Ford). Lee van Cleef would return in ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966). In ""A fistfull of dollars"" there is one bounty hunter dealing with two gangs. In ""For a few dollars more"" there are two bounty hunter dealing with one gang. ""A few dollars more"" is a darker movie than his predecessor. Became the man with no name in ""A fistfull of dollars "" only halfway the movie the good guy (because of a woman), in ""For a few dollars more"" he remains an opportunist until the very end. Only in the final episode ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966) the man with no name is good from the beginning onwards."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),Legendary Spaghetti Western,"For a Few Dollars More from 1965 by Sergio Leone is probably the best, most solid ""blueprint"" Spaghetti western there is. The corner stone of the story is two introverted and mysterious lone bounty hunters hunting for criminals. Very interesting about the film is the relationship between Clint Eastwood's character Monco and Lee van Cleef's character Col. Mortimer. They start out as potential rivals both hunting the same criminals and having had the same anticipation of their behaviour and plan of robbing the bank in El Paso. When the decide to work together it get something of a mentor-student element since Mortimer has much more experience. But Monco and him also don't completelly trust each other and Monco wants to go his own way at some point, while the Colonel wants to keep working together. At that moment Monco probably wanted to go alone because he didn't want to share the bounty, but at the end of the film it is revealed Mortimer's motive was vengeance for his sister. In beginning of the film the bounty hunters come over as mainly egocentrical in their motive. But later in the film they turn in the morally good ones. This is on one hand by Indio's extreme cruelty. On the other hand by revealing of the Colonel's motive being vengeance for his sister and him letting Monco keep all the money and Monco in turn offering the Colonel his part. The acting in the film is very good, Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef have the perfect looks and manner for this kind of film. Also the wife of the hotel owner who likes Monco is perfectly cast. The cinematography is excellent. The quietness and rawness in Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone Spaghetti westerns is unique and really an experience to watch."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),For a Few Dollars More,"The story begins with a scene in which Colonel Cole Douglas Mortimer appears carrying the Bible while the train man tries to check the passengers' tickets, referring the film director & writer of the story by that to the journey of life and the role of divine justice. Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monaco (Clint Eastwood) are bounty hunters. They both after (Gian Maria Volonté) Indio, a criminal and bank robber for his bounty. They decide to join forces againt Indio and his gang. The character of Eindo embodies the thirst for blood, treachery, envy, cunning, stealing and vanity, which are characteristics that represent the evil in human nature. At the beginning of the film, it seems to us that Colonel Mortimer and Monko are after Indio for money, only because they are both bounty hunters, but the events of the film prove the opposite. Indio's motives for murder and theft are still unknown, which makes him the most mysterious and complex character in the movie. Despite this, the actor succeeded in playing this difficult role, embodying the various emotions and psychological ills of the character. In contrast to the Joker, the evil man, who, despite this, enjoys wide sympathy from the public, the character of Indio remains an outcast who represents evil in its worst form."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),"Twice done, twice the charm","Sergio Leone returns a year later with yet another western epic, again starring Clint Eastwood as the titular ""man with no name"" character, and again utilizing lots of actors from the first film. Is it quite as good as Fistfull of Dollars? I would have to say no, in fact, it is probably the weaker installment in the entire Dollar trilogy - but that is a very high bar, and doesn't take away from how much of a masterpiece this film is. Leone, accompined by the legendary Ennio Morricone's score, once again builds a memorable and incredible tale of the rough life in the west, utilizing lots of great cutting and editing and many of the long shot techniques that have since become standard for the genre. Overall, truly an incredible western that should definitely be experienced by any lover of film."
For a Few Dollars More (1965),Just Wears You Out,"Sergio Leone, certainly in this film, and in general save The Good the Bad and the Ugly, is at his best with a scene. Meaning, over the course of his excessively drawn out films there's a few flashes of his creativity that work while most of it just grinds you down with tedium. Its certainly a style, and I suppose you can give points for care because there doesn't appear to be a frame that isn't given the utmost intention; Leone treats each one like it's the most important shot in the movie. But theres so many great, precious scenes we're drowning in them. Even if you try and give yourself to it and soak it in I think you will eventually be worn out. Somewhere buried in this film is a more concise, energetic movie that frankly would be more watchable. However, how it stands Morricone is almost like a second director with his score, Clint Eastwood is of course by far the best thing going for it and he has a particularly good chemistry with Lee Van Cleef."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Existential,"I rated Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997) 8/10. The doc that started the ""competition"" genre of documentary. It's amazing how existential it is just trying to win a truck."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),GREAT movie,"You'll see a bit of everything in this crazy story and it's all human. So many characters, so much drama, so much insanity. You won't believe it's real, but it is and it's glorious."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Great watch,"Saw this on Facebook! I like odd shows, this had me pulled rite in! Def worth the watch!"
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Uniquely and Surprisingly Satisfying,"I don't recall what drew me to this documentary about a contest in Texas to win a pick-up truck, but whatever it was I'm grateful for it. The film opens with all of the contestant introducing themselves solo on camera. Some of them didn't have front teeth, and others seemed like such backwoods stereotypes that I thought I'd had all of the participants, and the film all figured out within the first 15 minutes. I kind of felt sorry for the participants because it seemed like the director was making fun of them in a back-handed kind of way. It wasn't long before the surprises starting coming, and those surprises didn't stop till the movie did. This is a beautiful and heartfelt film which wonderfully and naturally captures the diversity and uniqueness of the people of this country. It's kind of special that way and I highly suggest you check it out for yourself."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Find documentaries boring? This is a rare exception.,"Hands On A Hard Body is a documentary about a contest where a handful of people compete to win a truck by standing for as long as they can. They must have at least one hand one the truck at all times and are not allowed to lean or bend over. The last one left after all others have given up wins the truck. These contests can last for several hours, some even going for days, and are one of the greatest tests of someone's patience, endurance, and willpower. To be honest, I didn't expect much going into Hands On A Hard Body; in fact I expected to be bored out of my mind. As the film opened and the first few shots came across the screen I was fully prepared for a potentially mind-numbing 98 minutes. What I didn't prepare for was that I might have a great time watching it. As the film rolled on and I started to learn about the contestants I was surprised to see that I was actually rooting for some of them, and then I realized something I could have never prepared myself for: I was actually enjoying the movie. I'm not usually a fan of documentaries because they depict real-world events and, to be completely honest, I don't enjoy reality. I like watching movies with original stories because I am given the opportunity to escape the dullness of everyday life and be taken to another, more exciting world. I especially enjoy a movie with an engaging story that absorbs me into its world and lets me get to know the characters because their struggles become my own, taking me away from my boring reality and drawing me into a more interesting one. Because documentaries are a depiction of reality I prefer to avoid them and watch the latest blockbuster instead. Hands On A Hard Body, however, is a rare documentary. From when the first contestants started dropping out to when the final few were fighting with all of their might I was on the edge of my seat, as if I were watching a blockbuster rather than a documentary. You got to know each contestant, decide which ones you liked or disliked, and then rooted for the ones that won you over, sharing in their struggles as you saw them strive and suffer to win that truck. There was one contestant in particular that I really identified with. As the film went on I was so absorbed into the story that I wanted to see this contestant win more than anything but was ultimately disappointed when they were not victorious. However, despite their loss I enjoyed every minute I spent with them. I wish there were more documentaries like Hands On A Hard Body, but not just because I want to be entertained; I want to be reminded that life is not always as dull as I think it is. Hands On A Hard Body showed me that there are moments when life is free of all stress and responsibilities, feeling less like a documentary and more like a summer blockbuster."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Great Plot,"I originally saw this movie in Austin and almost fell out of my seat on several occasions from laughing so hard. Truly Texas. You can't miss this one! I was so surprised when I watched this movie. It has a great plot and the end is a real surprise. The human emotion and drama that unfolds as these contestants try and win a pickup truck is unbelievable not to mention hilarious. ""Cars don't make money, Trucks make money."" I believe that this film very much shows how good documentaries are made. Even though the filmmakers don't interfere so much in the film it is still interesting. Others film made in this style tend to be really boring - This is an incredible slice of Americana. Invaluable to anyone interested in East Texas culture and the diversity of peoples in this country. A masterpiece in its genre."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Find it and Enjoy it. It's real all the way through!,"would you like to make US$6k a day for 3 days? do you need to make US$6K a day for 3 days? 13 people say a definite YES to the first question, and I'm guessing 2/3 of those qualify for a YES on the second (me 2 for what it's worth!). these are real southern people in the real America, and this film shows they have some real heart and dreams, and compassion as well. i saw it in the theater in Atlanta in '97, and just found it on the Internet and watched it again tonight. as good as I remember, maybe better. i am going to twist some arms of non-Americans here in Brasil to watch and enjoy this movie, because it has heart and is universal. Find it and Enjoy it!"
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),Eye-opening doc about a simple competition.,"If you've ever wondered what it's like to be in one of those contests where you have to keep one hand on a car for as long as possible, this movie will definitely fill you in on what will go down. Like many other people, if I ever had the chance to participate in a contest like this, I'd probably jump at the chance. Well, after seeing this, maybe not. Depends how nice the car/truck is. Because after watching all the personalities fade away either physically or mentally, it's really an eye-opening experience, that no person should take lightly. You've got people from all walks of life participating. From country bumpkin folk who just desperately want to win, to past winners, to Jesus-freaks who believe the power of the one above will push them to the ultimate goal, to even waitresses and ex-marines. All are entertaining in their own right, but a few select characters, like my favorite, the black dude, who should have taken up stand-up comedy as a means of living, rule the day. Usually this appears to be some sort of fun, play around type contest, but the thing is, it's anything but. Backs, ankles, feet begin to hurt and eventually if you're up for over 30 hours or so, the mind begins to fade. You always knew that these types of things would occur, but to watch them is a totally different story. And I must admit, it's pretty damn funny. Watching one dude say he'll be here for a while, and then fast forward a couple hours and he appears to be on death's door. Hands on a Hard Body, isn't a contest for body-builders (though they may do well, if their mind is strong), but for everyday, hard-working people who want to win their hand at a brand new truck and some well-deserved respect along the way.  If you're ever given the chance to enter one, research it a little bit because this movie definitely shows the viewer these contests aren't as easy as they appear."
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),A funny visit to the extremes of the human condition,"An unexpected look at an apparently simple contest. This movie has tension, humor, insight, and heart. For so many Americans the divide between making it and failing is a working car. In a small town we see what some people will do to win a fully-loaded new pick-up truck. One person here commented that the film exploits the poor people in the contest. I disagree. The people are presented as rounded individuals and the film includes interviews with the main characters, showing their viewpoints and not in a condescending way. The audience will find them amusing, but the tension comes from taking the contest seriously, and therefore, we take the contestants seriously too. We laugh at the human condition. It's a shame this DVD is out of print. We still need this film!"
Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary (1997),awesome - hysterical - hilarious!,"i bought this DVD on impulse based on all the ravingly positive user comments at amazon.com. ever skeptical i figured nothing could be that funny, but it was under $10 and so i thought what the hell, something with so many raves has to be at least worth a smile right? wrong!! its hysterical, rolling on the floor laughing your ass off funny. rarely have i watched something that made me laugh and laugh and laugh so hard. a whole bunch of rednecks going through some insane communal sleep deprivation exercise. and what a bunch of characters! i swear they will live with me forever. the smiley-happy black dude, his shoes and his snicker bars - just classic. it also has an ending/climax that couldn't have been better if an Oscar winning scriptwriter created it. the video quality is something awful, but in this case content rules! you really have to see this movie...really!"
Million Dollar Razzle Dazzle (2022),Compassionate Story,"If you like the 80's and a story about compassion, then this is for you. The lead character Dwayne has a friend who is seriously ill and cannot afford the treatments for his disease. Dwayne figures if he could get himself on a popular game show in LA, he might just win enough money so that he can get his friend the treatment he desperately needs. This is the story about true friendship and the obstacles Dwayne has to overcome in his journey. But it's not all serious as there are some comical scenes such as between the game show host and his wife., when he's accused of cheating. It's full of nostalgia of 80's game shows where you can take a look back at some memorable items that you may remember from the past."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Yet another effort that will not move the needle,"The video is upfront in what it is: it's stories about people trying to escape North Korea. And that's my main problem: it's completely anecdotal, there's nothing new compared to, for example, the works of Yeonmi Park, or that documentary on the murder of the brother in that airport. Interesting questions are not asked. Given that our world is remarkably simple in that following the money usually tells you all you need to know, who is this status quo benefiting? Why don't we have South Korean fortunes funding escapes? Why is the West so clearly indifferent? Why not talk about the abject racism between Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, and even how South Koreans despise North Korean defectors? I think that questions that ""hurt"" would be a lot more worth of screen time. World's tough, people die all the time, North Korea is a hell hole. We know that. What next is a question worth asking, and isn't addressed here. I found it quite telling that you have to rely on religion to find heroes. Not an NGO, not a government, not a corporate, not a rich patron, not a community, but a church."
Beyond Utopia (2023),"Sad, uplifting and hard to ignore","Ever since seeing ""Beyond Utopia"" I've been thinking about what makes a top-class documentary. It doesn't need to be entertaining, since that's the job of fiction, but it must be compelling and almost more than real. Maybe that's the trick? To show you an aspect of the world that you'd dismiss as unbelievable if you didn't know it to be true. That's exactly what you get here. I knew, vaguely, that North Korea was this bizarre puppet state founded by Kim Il Sung and propped up by Russia. I also knew that his dynasty inculcated an almost religious aura around themselves as the father, mother and spirit of the country. What I didn't know, or consider, was just how these so-called leaders managed to persist in the face of economic collapse, famine and prosperity elsewhere. What they've managed to combine is nationwide brain-washing and a totalitarian state of control that would make Stalin proud. And yet that still doesn't get to the heart of the darkness. To control the population everyone is spying on everyone else. If you step out of line then you're sent to a reeducation camp. If you really step out of line (by trying to flee the country perhaps) then you wind up in the gulag and no one comes back from the gulag. But before then you'll be beaten, tortured and crushed with your family being forcibly relocated to another part of the country. Despite this the poor North Korean people in ""Beyond Utopia"" still love their nation and why shouldn't they. It's where they belong and where their culture resides. The problem is that the communist state forces them to leave and to leave everything behind. It's just horrific on all counts. The film pulls absolutely no punches in following the perilous journey undertaken by the refugees being tracked. There really isn't much of a happy ending for anyone when you dig into the meat of the story and there aren't any winners. Just victims of a murderous regime. That said it's a must watch if you want to be educated."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Extraordinary,"Beyond Utopia is not a journey into the ""hermit kingdom"" (as other documentaries have attempted over the decades) but a journey out, for those lucky enough to get the opportunity. As Pastor Kim - the film's de facto hero - says, the hard part is not crossing the North Korea/China border, but navigating to safety from China, all the way to South Korea via Thailand. A fraught and treacherous journey indeed, one that is becoming more difficult all the time. One of the most extraordinary elements of this film is that we, the audience, are privileged to accompany a family of defectors (they were actually banished but I won't go into that) all the way through this exhausting endurance test, and hopefully to safety. Said family is certainly not one you would wish to put through such hardship, consisting as it does of two girls around 6-8 years old, their parents and their grandma of 80 years. An unlikely group of survivors - but these are North Koreans, a people whose hardiness and determination are showcased with extraordinary vividness throughout this film. The mere act of capturing unauthorised footage in the country is highly dangerous, and yet there is plenty to see here (including some distressing footage of public executions and secret beatings). But the focus is always on the people, their stories, their feelings, their worldview. The filmmakers intentionally make the things about NK we always see on the news (Kim Jong Un, the nukes, the palace intrigue) only background to the realities of everyday life. But the most extraordinary element of all is Pastor Kim himself, a tirelessly heroic champion who coordinates the journey of the family via the many anonymous brokers who lead, drive and accommodate them on their long journey south. Remarkably, he personally escorts them through much of the journey despite a number of personal injuries and medical complaints, just as he has with hundreds of others before (and hopefully hundreds more in the future). This is an incredibly emotional journey that is impossible not to feel on the deepest level. A more powerful and intimate documentary about this strange and terrifying country and its people is hard to imagine. By shining such a bright light on the struggles of some of the world's most oppressed citizens, this is a hugely important film that will inspire sympathy across the world, and hopefully even some positive change for North Koreans."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Exceptional documentary,"This film is outstanding. One of the things about North Korean coverage in general is the tendency for major news brands to craft a somewhat sanitized story about the personality cult of Kim Jong-Un (a fat, spoilt dictator) and his powerful sister (creepy, bloodless, etc). The issue here is that it evades the real issue with North Korea, namely the suffering public that have endured famine followed further food shortages, public executions and lived in undeveloped squalor amid the sham of fascist indoctrination and state powers that prolong the poverty and repressive nature of the place but require utmost respect from the citizenry. Throughout the film, without spoiling details, we see the complexities, danger and, at times, heroism of real people escaping the ruins of the Kim dynasty, including rarely seen footage of the state that, not surprisingly, is kept from public view. The family in much of the narrative leaves in unison, meaning that young children and grandparents also must cross rivers, mountainous terrain and deal with possibly deceptive fixers (or ""brokers"") that can arrange the network of vans and safe-houses allowing North Koreans to travel thousands of kilometers across Asia to find land where they can be classified as defectors. At the viewing I attended, audiences were obviously moved by the repressiveness and deprivation of North Korean lives and the relatable humanity of it's victims. In this particular feature documentary, a South Korean pastor who'd long ago left the North is able to assist with their travels. Having lost a family member in an earlier personal tragedy, Pastor Sengeun Kim risks life and limb helping other family members to improve their lives. It's not well understood (or perhaps believed) how repressive the North's rules are - defectors risk being shot or may receive severe physical beatings, at worst they may die in the nation's gulag system. Others leave only to be sold into sex trafficking or other exploitative schemes. Some defectors wish to get family members out but are unable to, as the information ban and threat level from the state severely complicates freedom of movement and basic human rights. Something lasting about seeing this item is that it's human qualities are moving, and authentic. As mentioned, much of the ""coverage"" we receive of North Korea is factual but also fabricated from motion graphics, recycled news footage, alternately tourists are sometimes allowed by rail from China for brief stage-managed visits of the brighter buildings of Pyongyang where visitors are led to well-maintained memorial statues of their permanent head of state and his offspring. Beyond Utopia actually examines the predicament of lives being lived in North Korea."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Ever so important testament to human strength,"My favorite movies are the ones that shatter my heart into a million pieces, and this documentary shook me to the core. ""Beyond Utopia"" is a powerful testament to human strength, skillfully crafted through brave filmmaking that takes us deep into the lives of families striving to escape North Korean oppression. The film's eye-opening portrayal of their journey exposes a world hidden from most of us, serving as a poignant reminder of the lengths people will go to for freedom. In today's world, where social cinema holds immense importance, this documentary stands as a prime example of its significance. However, be prepared for a very tough watch as it showcases the unfiltered reality these families endure."
Beyond Utopia (2023),A document of mutual guarantee,"This is a brave and important human document like no other. The fact that any of us can go on with our lives after watching this movie is a shocking point to think about. This film should be shown in every educational system in the world, as a document of mutual guarantee. The film is made with human wisdom and human love. The illustration that completes the places where the camera did not collect evidence is a subtle and smart presence. There is no doubt that I will carry this film inside me for many days to come. Social cinema is an activity that we should all embrace with love. There are cases like in this case, that the film is all that can be done and therefore its distribution is so important. Our world is undergoing an alarming change, and by watching such a film, we leave our consciousness compassionate, aware and alert."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Tough Lives and Brave Hearts of North Korean Defectors,"""Beyond Utopia"" is a film that really hits home. It takes us right into the lives of North Korean defectors, showing the hard truth of life back in their home country and their daring run for freedom. But this movie isn't just about a thrilling escape. It's about the big ideas of freedom and democracy, and what happens when people don't have them. It makes you think about how much these rights matter, and how far people would go to get them. The people who made ""Beyond Utopia"" did a great job of telling this difficult story. It all feels real, from the plot to the characters, and that makes the struggle of the defectors all the more moving. What's really interesting about ""Beyond Utopia"" is how it makes you think about freedom and democracy. It shows you the importance of these things, and what life is like without them. It's a good reminder to value our rights and understand the lengths some go to gain them. The look of the film is also pretty cool. Every scene is shot well, adding to the story and making you feel even more connected to what's happening on screen. To wrap up, ""Beyond Utopia"" isn't just a movie. It's a close look at a world we don't know much about, and a story about some real brave people fighting for a better life. It's the kind of movie that stays with you and makes you think, and it's definitely worth a watch."
Beyond Utopia (2023),The most important movie you can see,"It is easy to think we are already aware that North Korea is ""bad"", and that its citizens are ""oppressed"". But can we really imagine what this means every day for the human beings living there? The importance of this film can be overstated. It transcends being ""just"" a film and becomes a cry for help that all of the free world must heed. Many people literally risked their lives for these stories to be told, and the least we can do to honor them is to hear their stories first hand. Nazi comparisons today are often thrown around carelessly, however, what is happening in North Korea is truly worthy of the comparison without a hint of hyperbole. But there are some amazing individuals doing their part to make a difference, and it is inspiring to learn more about them in this film. As of this writing, there is no US distribution for ""Beyond Utopia"". It seems no one (yet) has the backbone to release this to all Americans. It's likely that echoes of what happened to Sony Pictures with the release of ""The Interview"" still lingers for some executives. But that risk is so superficial compared to what North Korean citizens are facing every minute. The actions of North Korea deserve to be uncloaked, and this film is a giant step in that direction."
Beyond Utopia (2023),Thrilling,"Amazing film with rarely seen footage that documents what is really going on in North Korea. Film kept you on the edge of your seat as you follow the lives of actual people attempting to escape North Korea. Film is intermixed with lots of good and shocking commentary of what daily life is really like in North Korea. Hard to believe that a country like that can still exist in the 21st century. Overall, film does an excellent job of both having action and plot twists similar to a typical film while at the same time providing amazing smuggled in camera footage of what the real day to day life(nightmare) is like in North Korea."
Beyond Utopia (2023),A GROUNDBREAKING DOCUMETARY,"This is a groundbreaking documentary about a place none of us can ever visit and probably will never be able to visit. I was beyond moved watching a story about an important topic that I knew so little about. It's critical for people to see as it's a real eye-opener to something we don't see or hear much about here in the US. While I have friends in the US who did escape with their parents as small children-- they've never shared their personal stories, and now I understand why. It's an intense, harrowing, and emotional documentary that needs to be seen by all. It brings something we've only heard about to actual life."
While We Watched (2022),Lies & Propaganda,"This documentary is trying to show that 1.4 billion people of India are fools and this self-proclaimed journalist is a beacon of truth. He is nothing but a liar, hate mongerer and the leader of left wing cabal. He was subservient to previous government and was enjoying all the perks of being close to the power. Now those perks and proximity with power has gone, he has gone rogue with the nation. All he is doing is not for any national interest, but his personal interest. So that when government changes, he can enjoy his lifestyle again and proximity with power. He is now looking for a job in various news portal with salary expectations of Rs 2 crors and all the left wing news channels denied him. He's not worth anything. His only viewers and followers are from the so called ""Peacful Community""."
While We Watched (2022),Canary in the Coal Mine,"A remarkable, fly on the wall documentary about one man's and one TV network's attempt to push back against the forces of fascism in their country. India is a warning sign to all democratic countries who are facing right wing, populist, anti-democratic political movements. Our democracies will not survive unless we fight back strenuously. India is ahead of many countries in this regard but they are not as far advanced as Hungary, Turkey and Brazil. If you care about the future of democracy in your own country, please watch this documentary and then get involved in supporting the survival of democracy at home. Thank you."

Huge props to Vinay Shukla for shedding light on the whole corporatization of Indian media scene and how they're using money and muscle to drive their agendas and stifle dissenting voices. Seriously, this movie should be mandatory for all budding journalists out there. It really gives you a reality check on what's happening in the Indian media landscape. And let's not even get started on the state of the Indian state - it's eye-opening how the so-called ""watchdog"" media has gone the other way and actively contributed to creating divisions among the people. As Ravish says, "" Scared journalist produces a dead citizen."" This movie is a wake-up call, for sure! 🎥👏"

While We Watched (2022),Banned in India,"The movie has been banned in India for a clear reason-it presents an unvarnished depiction of the eroding state of democracy in the country. Rather than glorifying Ravish Kumar, it portrays him as an ordinary journalist bravely fighting against formidable odds to uphold genuine journalism in India. The film shines a light on how the media in India has, regrettably, become an instrument of the government, perpetuating falsehoods and propaganda. Instead of addressing crucial issues, many news channels in India now peddle senseless content under the guise of nationalism. Anyone who dares to speak out against corruption involving figures like Modi and Adani is unfairly branded as anti-national. It's noteworthy that NDTV, where Ravish Kumar once worked, is now under the ownership of Modi's associate, Adani. Consequently, the landscape of independent news channels in India has been significantly altered."
While We Watched (2022),Reality of Indian situation on democracy,"A very good documentary, which shows how a journalist goes through his struggle because he ""asks questions"" in his candid and real form. At the same time, it has also been shown in a better way that how the present Indian journalism has worked to poison the people and has changed the mental state of the people in such a way that by brainwashing them, they have made them a weapon for politics. Being used in. If I talk about cenemtography, it seems absolutely real as if you are seeing a real story from above. However, it is also true that every second shown in the film is 100% true. Ravish Kumar is the best journalist as he is now."
While We Watched (2022),Must watch for Every Indian,"Sad reality of India and story of the great man, who didn't win but was on the battlefield. This movie is not about Ravish, who no doubt is heart and soul of the movie. It is about India, and the journalism in India. It should be watched by each and every India, and not only Indians, but the people who want democracy to be the driving force of the international politics
This movie shows the communal anchors, who are not journalists but vile hate filled propagandists. There should be wide audience and reception for this movie so that other vinay shuklas have to courage to dedicate their time and money to speak for the people This movie is by the people to the people and for the people."
While We Watched (2022),One of The Most Important Documentaries of Our Time,"Journalism has evolved more than any industry in the world today. Today, journalism isn't about just reporting the news, in today's capitalist world, the word ""news"" itself has a totally different definition. News channels do not care about reporting what is true, their channel survives on revenue from advertisements and other vested interests. This is true everywhere but it's ugliest face can be seen in today's India and most particularly North Indian/Hindi news channels. Ravish Kumar, the face of this documentary is a popular prime time news reporter, whose rapport has grown over the years for being a sane voice in the midst of madness. His unapologetic criticism of today's media landscape and the current ruling party is unrelenting. He doesn't bow down to threats and never compromises his principles even when sorrounded by a lynch mob. While the documentary, solely focuses on his struggle to be a principled journalist in ""New India"", it also shows the tidal wave of hate that has destroyed Northern India's civil society. Gone are the days when news channels in India reported on actual issues like climate change, unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, etc. Over the last 10 years, their focus has shifted to promoting chest-thumping toxic nationalism and mainstreaming islamphobic conspiracies. Ravish Kumar tells us how words in studios lead to actual violence against India's religious minorities, especially Muslims. This documentary is a tribute to the 1000s of journalists who to this day, report actual facts and not dumb down a nation of billion people in these dark uncertain times where democracy dies every day."
While We Watched (2022),Not all battles are fought for victory. Some are fought simply to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield - Ravish Kumar,"Through the years and times yet to come we will need to determine where do we stand as individuals, society, family and a nation. Why have we failed to support democracy which entirely lie in our hands? Why don't we at least now navigate this very essential problem? What we have been taught? What education is supposed to mean? These are very natural questions we have no choice but to ask ourselves. The biggest act of patriotism is to question one's government, Right now there is nothing more rational than to ask ourselves, the people around us, the politicians and most of all the journalists, what is the india they envision?"
Before the Flood (2016),We have to consider about climate change,"As an environmentalist, Leonardo DiCaprio toured around the world and stated the current situation about climate change. This is a documentary of his interview with some experts. I often hear that changing your behavior has the effect of improving the earth's situation. But actually most people are indifferent. I also thought about it, and realized once again to focus only on things that are convenient to me. I learned about decreasing 80% greenhouse gas by switching your diet from beef to chicken. As the movie recommends, I'd like to try to choose the next action such as what I buy, what I eat, and stuff like that. I thought this movie was relatively easy to solve the current earth situation even if you have not been interested in climate change."
Before the Flood (2016),We all should think about climate change,"Before the flood is about climate change. In this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio, who is designated as a messenger of the United Nations, goes around the world, looks at the real situation of climate change and hears about the situation from top scientists and political leaders. Until I watched it, I had hardly thought of climate change, but after watching it, I got interested in climate change. The most impressive part for me is the explanation about the amount of melted ice in Greenland. I didn't know global warming was so serious. If you watch this movie, you can know the seriousness of climate change. I recommend this to people who are not interested in environmental problems yet. I gave this movie 7 points because it is thought-provoking. Actually, I got to think about climate change in various situations of life, like taking a shower, turning lights on etc."
Before the Flood (2016),Before the Flood,"Today,There are a lot of environmental issues on the earth. Leonardo DiCaprio went to a different place and met people to learn about environmental issues in the movie. And He complains about the necessity of action to solve them. I got a lot of new views on environmental issues from this movie. I hadn't had much information about environmental issues,so It was a good experience for me. It's very difficult to solve the environmental issues for us. But I thought we have to keep trying to solve the problem so the world is getting better. I wanna try to do something I can do to solve environmental issues,if it'll be hard for me."
Before the Flood (2016),Warning about climate change from Leonardo DiCaprio and people around the world,"In this movie, DiCaprio went around the world and he was heard some talkings about the reality of climate change from people who are suffering from it or people who have knowledge about it. Then, DiCaprio noticed the seriousness of climate change and tried to change people's minds and actions by movies or campaigns. I saw this video and I was surprised and shocked by the reality of climate change, something like melting ice or mining and using fossil fuels. At the same time, by watching this movie, I think it's important to change our minds and actions to stop climate change, but also it's more and more difficult to change our lives to save our planet than I thought because our rich and happy lives are based on using a lot of energy. Therefore, I recommend this movie to everyone because people can recognize the reality of climate change and the importance of changing our lives. So, I rate this movie as nine."
Before the Flood (2016),It is a great movie to learn about environment,"That movie is a necessary thing that people should watch. The movie tells the story of the future of the planet due to global warming and tells the realistic current situation. Before I watched this movie, I didn't think much of the environmental issue and handed it over to the next generation. But I realized this issue is our thing, and we should do something for the next generation. People should watch this movie and realize our reality. In addition, we must think together about the expected human-made results and practice what individuals can do first. I'll give this movie 9 stars. I think it could have escaped the pessimistic movie if they had told each other something that we could practice in our life."
Before the Flood (2016),Before the Flood,"Before the Flood is a powerful documentary released in 2016, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the narrator and environmental advocate. DiCaprio travels the world, meeting with scientists, activists, and world leaders to address the environmental challenges our planet faces. The movie combines scientific information with personal narratives, making a compelling case for immediate action to combat climate change. It provides a comprehensive overview of the causes and consequences of global warming. Before the Flood is visually stunning and emotionally impactful, encouraging viewers to reflect on the environmental impact of human activities for that I really recommend watching this movie."
Before the Flood (2016),we have to change our mind,"We have to think about envioroment. Electoric car or changing to electoric is the best way?? I don't think so. My opinion, electoric made of thermal power generation.so I don't know goverment and some car campany telling change the fuel to electoric. But in this movie i have a lot of learn about envioroment issue. Easpecially, i did't know about palm oil. You know the palm oil issue. If you don't know palm oil effect to envioroment. You have to watch the movie. DiCaprio is good at interviwer. He has many knowlege about envioroment issue. His question is very cleary. So i can understand easily. If you never think about envioroment issue. You have to learn start to this movie. It's easy for you. I hope."
Before the Flood (2016),Mesmerizing ! to open our eyes.,"It's a great film ! Mesmerizing ! The documentary successfully communicates the dire status of the earth and what can be done to prevent further harm, such as eating chicken instead of beef and voting for propositions that prevent climate change. The most thought-provoking person is Leonardo DiCaprio who traveled the world for two years talking with scientists, NASA experts and politicians about the causes and effects of climate change. This film is for those who are really interested in the planet and how it can affect the next generations and their development. The documentary brings attention to climate change and calls for action. I really recommend you watch the film !"
Before the Flood (2016),Save our planet the Earth,"After a long journey around the world, Leonard di Caprio who was the ambassador of peace in 2015 made a movie that was a warning, a call to our governements to make crucial decisions for the future of our planet due to the global warming. This documentary must be seen by each of us as it helps to find out how fare we have gone and what we have to do to stop it. Obama is maybe the most thought provoking person
explaining not only environment but security of the nation might be in danger. If politicians do what the people want them to do we must vote for the right person
Obama is optimist and think that if we keep pushing there is no reason why we can t solve this problem."
Before the Flood (2016),The world in our power,"""Before the Flood"" is a powerful and thought-provoking documentary that paints a vivid picture of the urgency of climate change. With Leonardo DiCaprio as a passionate and well-informed guide, the film effectively communicates the scale of the environmental crisis through stunning visuals and compelling interviews. In an age where climate change is an ever more pressing concern, ""Before the Flood"" is a crucial educational tool and a call to action. Its emotional resonance and well-structured narrative make it a must-watch for individuals, policymakers, and corporations alike, inspiring a sense of responsibility for our planet and driving home the message that the time to address climate change is now."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Review for Resource Use Class (stirring film for sure),"The film Food, Inc. (2008) is an acclaimed expose into the world of factory farms and processed foods. Watching this film, many Americans will see, for the first time, just what goes on behind the scenes that brings their food to the shelves and drive throughs at shopping and fast-food chains like Walmart and Burger King. The film brought attention to the horrors of the slaughterhouse industry as well as the human rights violations utilized by meat packing companies to lower costs. It also shows the polar opposite of these factory farming operations, featuring several organic and sustainable farms run by independent local farmers and sent to smaller markets. These smaller farmers, however, must compete with the giant firms like Perdue and Tyson to get their products to consumers, and given the lack of nutrition education among many Americans, the consumer often chooses the hormone enriched and water injected meats of the factory farming companies. The issue with improving the standard of eating in this country is that the corporations behind GMO meats and processed and fast foods are interlinked with our government. The same executives at these companies, like Donald Rumsfeld and others, work as extremely important politicians in the halls of congress, often doing internal lobbying for these firms and helping to keep them on top of competitors and in front of consumers. They purposely use policy and biased regulations to drive out the little man in the food production world, independent agriculture. The in depth look at these processes in Food, Inc. Is given added shock value as the filmmakers enter into the factory farms themselves, showing the atrocious conditions in which the animals eaten in America often live. There is much imagery of pigs being crushed and electrocuted in mass, chicken-houses where dead fowl litter the floors and others where the chickens spend their entire lives in cages before they are slaughtered and eaten. The film then juxtapositions this imagery alongside that of the farmers at small independent farms, where care is taken for the livestock, and they are dispatched quickly and humanely. The impact these scenes have on the viewer emotionally is instinctual and natural, requiring no critical thinking to assess that factory farming and industrialized meat production is wrong and disgusting. The film does not only rely on this shock value, however, to get its point across. The film provides detailed empirical and anecdotal evidence of the sever health detriments that processed and fast foods have on the population, with the rise in obesity and heart disease paralleling the rise in widespread commercialized food. Additionally, the filmmakers go above and beyond by displaying the human rights violations faced by migrant workers forced into meatpacking jobs, as they are hired with the intent to fire them if they ever complain about their illegally low wages. All in all, Food, Inc. Is an incredibly effective expose piece that engages the viewer with imagery and interviews throughout while also provoking discussion and thought about one's own eating habits and those of our country. If you are curious or passionate about food production, government regulations on industry, nutrition, animal rights, or many more related topics, this film is a must watch. By Tom Eskew."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Only a tad better than a Michael Moore exposé,"Food comes from gulags for animals. Even plant life does not escape scrutiny. The thing that I did not expect was the push to tell you that the FDA has no teeth in the matter. It is defiantly a different FDA that I dealt with in the medical device industry; they carried guns and badges. A lot of the film was tearjerker stories. Deaths and poor people eating while driving. We get to watch animals getting dispatched. Not sure where they are going with the small section in the center of the film about Wal-Mart going organic. There is a Monsanto police story catching farmers saving seeds; it is sort of a mini McCarthy film. The rest of the film is an updated version of the Russian film ""Earth"" (1930) where the nasty government made the proletariat use tractors to pull their plows. The bottom line is everyone has a choice. Exposés only sell films. There is nothing revolutionary to justify wasting time viewing."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Healthy products are essential for a healthy life.,"It tries to explain that organic and sustainable farming is healthier for humans and other living things. At times boring, but interesting. Healthy products are essential for a healthy life."

"Food, Inc. (2008)",One of my personal favorites! Recommend everyone see this at least once,"The film I watched was Food Inc. By Robert Kenner. This by far is one of my favorite documentaries, I will be recommending this for years to come. Food Inc focused on factory farming meat production, GMO's focusing on corn and soybeans as they hold a lot of stock within the agriculture industry. The film concludes on litigation between the giant agricultural corporations and the farmers that are trapped within the system. It opens one's eyes to the intricacies and sometimes horrors of big agriculture like key players; Monsanto, Smithfield, and Tyson to name a few. The focus for sustainability came across in the first half mainly, as it focused on the effects of factory farming within America's meat industry, and it focused on how much water and grains were used in the production of factory farming as well as the carbon emissions into the environment from this method. The use of visually striking graphics helped drive this anti-factory farming message home as well as shed light on how much of the food industry we do not know about. Watching this documentary as a newcomer not knowing the ins and outs of how our food is made. It struck a chord with me how much land was needed to produce the space for these animals to live indoors for essentially the entirety of their lives. That space could be better used for better animal welfare as they would have more room to grow and thrive naturally rather than be cramped into metal boxes and pumped with fillers. The farmers specifically the chicken farmers within the documentary were not able to have the open-air open land concept that many traditionally associate with free-range chickens as many were in binding legal constraints with Tyson and Perdue. On top of the ever-present threat of litigation, many chicken farmers were sick due to bacteria and the ammonia within the chicken's excrement and the close contact the farmers experience on a day-to-day basis. If the wider spaces were used efficiently and sustainably for the meat industry and these animals rather than them being cramped right next to each other maybe our overall health as one of the top eating meat nations would improve as well as a reduction in total emission if a diet change from grains to more traditional foods was implemented as well as a free-range aspect. Finally, I think this documentary was well made and allowed an insight into the underworld of how our food is made and can open people's eyes to some of the horrors and health adverse decisions that mega-corporations are making to meet a bottom line. I believe everyone should see this film at least once, whether you want to make an environmental/health change or are just curious how the sausage gets made!"
"Food, Inc. (2008)",intro to western food politics,"I felt divided a lot about this movie. On one end, it showed up really well how the food industry was incorporated into the politician system, and how the economics of it worked, in the american context. On the other hand, a lot of it was dealing with animal as products, and I'm not falling for reformist politics on that one. I'm not falling either for wal-mart shelving organic stuff and rebrandinc itself as ""sustainability"". For the animal thing, a consummer/food advocate were lobbying the FDA about more control, which essentially was based on ""terminating"" the cattle if deceases were found... mhh. The Monsanto, and GM/patent on life part was interesting, especially by explaining how tied the people were, including non-disclosure agreements during pre-court settlements. Also, the movie challenged classist and more radical opinions by explaining the way the subsidized agriculture, due to lobbying was making junk&processed food cheaper than traditional food, and how much this food made cheaper in a large scale was messing up more traditional agriculture systems, which were not, and are then conceived as non-competitive enough. Some good and some bad..."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Great movie and not all dark!,"I learned a lot from watching this movie for my Human Nutrition college class. It exposes the bad parts of where we get our food. I like that it also exposes some progress that we've made, to improve our quality of food. From watching the movie this seems like a regression, but I'm glad they showed some positives, by showing a retailer that wanted to sell organic."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Food Engineering Review,"I gave this movie a 6/10 after watching it through a Food science and engineering lens. It was interesting to see how food engineering ties in with the business side of industrial farming. I did not know the difference between organic and inorganic food before watching. The quality of the movie was good because it explained many disadvantages of industrial farming and had interviews with real farmers as evidence. However, I believe the movie belittled food engineering and could have used it in a more positive way to depict how it has helped farmers bring better quality food to people's plates. Food science and engineering is extremely important in the production of food and ensuring that people are getting edible and tasteful products. I did not like how the movie focused on how food engineering supported industrial farming because it is so much more than that. Although inhumane industrial farming is terrible, it does not overpower how much food engineering has benefited our world. For example, the movie explained that corn is one of the most common harvested crops because the demand for it is so high. A food investigator looked deeper into this and found that there is corn in an immense amount of products, such as soda, ketchup, mayo, pudding, yogurt, and much more. This was only possible because food scientists were able to come up with a use for the surplus of corn in the United States. They were able to make products cheaper for Americans by creating substitutes with corn (corn oil, cornmeal, corn syrup). Another example of food engineering explained in the movie that was depicted as a bad thing was the cleaning process of meat. Cow meat often has E. coli due to their diet that is high in corn. Food scientists were able to come up with a cleaning process where they douse the meat in ammonia to kill the E. coli. This process has allowed farmers to keep feeding their cows cheap food while also keeping Americans safe from E. coli. I don't understand why these things were depicted as bad! I agree, organic food is better for you, but the only way may food products are possible are through food engineering! I wish this movie showed food science and engineering in a better light."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Loved this movie!,"When a movie makes you change your diet or take any action, you know it's a great movie! Fantastic work by the team."
"Food, Inc. (2008)",Very informative,Exposes incredible information on the food industry - shameful unethical industry
A Storm Foretold (2023),Rare inside view into January 6 and the minds of Trump's orbit,"The documentation provides a rare inside view into January 6 and the mind of a central member of Trump's orbit - Roger Stone, a 40-year long supporter and enabler of Trump(ism). Stone allowed the director to get a close inside view of his activities, and his thinking up to and during the events of January 6, 2021. A portrait of narcicism and vanity. The director includes part of his personal efforts and health issues during the making, which is understandable due to the obvious relation to his work. At the screening in Zurich's ZFF the viewers were stunned over most part of the movie, leaving one shocked and amazed. Brilliant!"
A Storm Foretold (2023),Essential viewing,"I always wondered what it's like in the lives of Trump allies, and this film gives the answer to one of them. It teaches you more than you would learn from Trump himself, about how difficult he can be, even at points empathizing with the key characters - Stone and the film's director himself. It is a peek into the people who believe reality is something to be challenged, and it's fascinating to see them try. The anger near the end is truly felt as the man who played the Jiminy Cricket of the former President's life is suddenly kept out of the occasion he has worked for the most. Essential viewing for all."
A Sexplanation (2021),Fun,"A Sexplanation is just your typical queer, Asian American, comedic sex education documentary about the universal search for love, connection and family acceptance. It's also the story of 36-year-old health reporter Alex Liu and his quest to uncover the naked truths, hard facts and no small amount of awkward moments. As he makes conversation with psychologists, sex researchers and even a Jesuit priest, Alex explores why sex has always caused him - and so much of America - so much shame. After all, he learned that only abstinence would make him a good person, which suppressed his sexuality and made the fact that he was gay very troubling for him. As he learns that comprehensive sex education is the answer, he also finds out that it's finally time to have the talk with his parents. Liu, who directed and co-wrote this movie with Leonardo Neri, said ""A Sexplanation follows my quest to confront my sex education - by finally getting a real one. Growing up, sex felt shameful. My parents never brought it up. School focused on disease, pregnancy, and abstinence. By my 30s, I was surprised by how much shame I still carried. After talking with friends, I realized I wasn't alone. The film documents my attempt to strip away this shame, no matter how awkward it might get - even masturbating in an MRI machine (for science!). Through honest conversations with scientists, educators, and even my parents, I try to uncover some naked truths and hard facts that will get us to a healthier, sexier future."" Alex is a funny guy and he takes what should be a subject that makes people blush at best and upset at worst and treats it with kindness and humor. This documentary moves so quickly and gets across some great information. It could even be a weekly show and I'd watch every episode. The graphics and editing highlight the main points of the movie too."
A Sexplanation (2021),A worthwhile documentary advocating for sex education,"A 30-something out gay man explores sex, sexuality, silence, and shame in North American culture. Attempting to demystify the subject, he travels around North America, meeting educators, researchers, and naysayers. The film is bookended with interviews with his parents. The thrust of this film is to encourage more information and non- judgemental discussion with children about sex, by parents and educators, rather than shame and prohibition that commonly occurs. The director mentions his favorite band Salt-N-Pepa, though not directly their song ""Let's Talk About Sex""."
Ukraine Is Not a Brothel (2013),Women led by a man,"I read Victor Malarek's excellent book, ""The Natasha's"" this morning and followed it up with this film which covers some of the same material. ""Natasha's"" are prostitutes who are predominantly from Russia and Ukraine and in this documentary we are shown protesters who use their states of undress to deliver a message against patriarchy. Say what!!! The founder of the Femen movement is a Charles Manson type who organized the rallies and even came up with the slogans displayed on the women's bodies. Victor is interviewed and he says that women are not capable of leading their own movement. The women agree that he has controlled them and one of them compares it to the ""Stockholm Syndrome.""
I found it all rather silly although I was captivated by many of the beautiful Ukranian women. Victor has great taste."
Ukraine Is Not a Brothel (2013),Filler,"It's naive to expect anything but propaganda from this documentary, but the ideological part of it is all over the place, proving that not even the scripts writers are women in this movement. The activists that degrade themselves for attention, come as damaged as the sexual exploration victims they pretend to fight for, and ironically it proves that regardless where you stand politically, the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us are always the most abused and exploited. Another irony is that they oppose the church that offered some structure and protection to women, even if antiquated, with an revolutionary ideology that offers nothing, whose only purpose is to destroy and create a void."
Ukraine Is Not a Brothel (2013),Interesting but feels a little stretched out,"This has been something I've wanted to watch for ages, but only finally found. Kitty Green's a very interesting filmmaker/documentarian, but her other films (Casting JonBenet and The Assistant) are definitely better than this one, which was her first feature. It's a very interesting topic, and has only become more topical in recent years. I think it explores the basic idea behind the protests well, and the way it looks at some of their shortcomings as well as accomplishments makes it more neutral and thought-provoking than it would be if the message was clear and more one-sided. I just don't know if there's enough here to warrant a feature length documentary. It runs out of steam quite a while before it ends, but much of what comes before it starts to get repetitive is very interesting - I think it could have been a great short documentary."
Ukraine Is Not a Brothel (2013),"Despotism, but in a new form, orthodoxy without the church","The message Femen send is very muddy. In the end only the breasts remain. So Ukraine was a mix of many territories and ethnic groups before the concept of modern countries reached that part of the world. And the Soviets reinforced that bringing more territories, like half of Poland, and more ethnic groups into the vast Eastern Province. Moscow leaders wanted everybody to be Russian so they have sent Russian speakers down in Ukraine. Even some of the girls come from these colonist families. The Soviet Union has died. As education was scarce, the only model available for forging a new nation is the Russian model. A totalitarian regime based on an invented nationality and culture, backed by church and a strong repressive system. The people around Femen do not like that strain of totalitarian system. Yet, their whole education is built on the same basis as the leaders of the newly invented Ukraine. In the end they are fighting the system to replace it with their own vision which is the same thing only worded a bit different. I bet on the current system which has far less conflicts. Femen are nationalists, although they fight for some inclusion given that some of them come from parents identifying as Russian. Yet nothing about the others. They have all orthodox Christian values, but without the corrupt priests. They want their breasts to be free, but they think they have a say about other women's vaginas. Although not as extreme and unpleasant, they are part of the same pro-purity, anti-corruption current as Marine LePen in France or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Sad. But, unless you are living there, boring. Later edit, after a second viewing. This is the only of quite a few documentaries that goes in deeper into the Femen movement. Compared with the made up propaganda of the French made documentaries, this one uses more personal footage and not just the girls spitting slogans at the camera. But I have my doubts the production team has more qualities than being sincere, where the other film makers tried to just ride the wave of popularity generated by Femen. In this case the production team just got lucky. The girls were finally paid enough to feel independent from Victor and talk about him, yet too soon to have built their own mythology. Inna even admits near the end how she is going to built up in France ""her"" Femen, thus morphing a backward nationalistic movement into yet another group wanting to take control of other people's bodies and hopefully their checkbooks.

Ukraine Is Not a Brothel (2013),"Come for the titties, stay for the deeper understanding of feminism: A Male Review","A no-holds-barred exploration of the ever fascinating minefield at the intersection of sex and politics, this documentary is a must-see for anyone who considers him- or herself a feminist. That is, anybody who thinks women deserve as much respect and consideration as men do. And anyone who doesn't, simply does not belong in this century.  As a red-blooded heterosexual male, I found the role of Victor Sviatsky, the male leader of Femen, especially thought-provoking. It made me acutely aware of my own complex response to these sexy feminists. How do I reconcile the animal and the human in me? Can I be both at the same time? What is the right ratio of testosterone to estrogen, to have both desire and empathy, and is there a conflict between the two? How do I maintain eye contact when breasts are on display? Eternal questions and lifelong struggles, all of these. Meanwhile the females of Femen are truly awe-inspiring. They are brave, intelligent and beautiful. Here in the West, we have popular comedians like Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer who push the envelope and bring new awareness to feminist issues, all while making us laugh and earning a living. This would not work in Ukraine, Russia, or much of the world for that matter. Not yet, anyway. There women have to get naked or get arrested, or both, to be heard.  Whether you see these women as heroes or exhibitionists, - and they could be both, - this doc deserves your attention. To say that you will never look at a naked woman the same again might be an exaggeration. We will still be animals, deep inside. But this film will certainly help you not to regard women as pieces of meat, even when they are naked and sexy, and should be a required viewing for that reason alone. As a minor criticism, the soundtrack could be more judicious. ""Kalinka"" and Boney M. don't help this film to be taken seriously.  Best wishes, love and respect go out to the filmmaker and the formidable women of Ukraine."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),documentary with heart💗,"This is a documentary with heart, big bursting heart. To watch these children living in the squalor they find themselves in - the girls wash dishes on the floor, there are no windows, they move to the next room when men come to see their mother so they only have to hear her make her living as a sex worker and not have to watch it - is heart breaking. To watch Zana Briski do what she can is heart lifting. Even in this tiny world where nobody has much if anything the boys are still given preferential treatment. Here they are at the bottom and they still buy into the myth that the boys should deserve and the girls work. The directors present this world in a way that grabs you and keeps you interested. They present the kids and their world intimately. They give the kids cameras and teach them photography and let them loose. The shots these kids take are wonderful and communicate their place in the world and their view."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),Amazing work is crown with a well crafted documentary,People forget that Zana spent 5 years of her life in the brothels to help kids. Some reviewers think she went there to make a 90 minutes film. This is a biproduct of a broader project. I am shocked how little footage she collected during this time. Zana's first intention was photographing the women but she faced resistance and shifted her focus to kids. I can only imagine how desperate you'd feel seeing your students are forced or have chosen the prostitution. The technical aspects of this documentary is very unique and combines filming and photography very well. We the audiences are lucky to see the world from the eyes of these kids.
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),There is always a way.,"Whenever I think of the city of Kolkata where chaos prevails and all contrasts come together, I dream of a warm sunlight hitting the face at sunset on a colorful street. Kolkata is a port city with a population of approximately 15 million, the city is India's second largest city. I came across this emotional and wonderful documentary while researching the state of Bengal, one of the areas I have always wondered about what's going on in back streets. I finally seen the truth of this life that I have been avoiding from seeing it for a while and I hope I can put my mixed feelings on paper. Nobody wants to be punished for all the social problems that the child will experience in line with the good education that an adult who has had a difficult life experience and has not completed his education cannot give his child. In this world where people are classified on every subject, we ignore children who are unaware of anything and are only sincere and leave them to their fate. Therefore, I think we should be conscious of self awareness which is one of the most important things in our personal development. Zana Briski is raising self awareness together, including herself with a few almost orphaned children in the back streets of Kolkata in 2004. Sometimes I think about the various thoughts that cross our minds and the fact that we can't get rid of being prejudiced. Prejudices that refer to factors such as gender, age, race, religion, physical appearance which can appear at any time in individual and social situations not be seen as a problem because they are often taken for granted. However, prejudices also threaten social cohesion. It is necessary to congratulate the director and his team who gave lessons to the audience with their approach to these beautiful children who are in the process of socialization for their wonderful work. I want to thank them for showing us the necessity of being conscious. I envy Avijit and his friends who don't extinguish the light of hope no matter what. Because, they always believed there was a way. I hope for a world where we know our responsibilities and are more aware that children are the most important beauty for our future. You must see this emotional truth."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids - An Honest and Moving Documentary Highlighting the Struggles and Strengths of Children in Poverty,"Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids is a poignant documentary that sheds light on the struggles of children living in the red-light district of Kolkata, India. Directed by Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman, the film follows the lives of several children who are born into a world of poverty, exploitation, and abuse. What sets this documentary apart is its honest portrayal of the realities of life in the red-light district. It does not shy away from showing the harsh living conditions, the physical and emotional abuse, and the hopelessness that these children face on a daily basis. However, the film is not without hope, as it also showcases the resilience, creativity, and strength of these children in the face of adversity. The filmmakers also deserve praise for their dedication and hard work in making this documentary. Briski and Kauffman lived in the red-light district for several years, gaining the trust of the children and their families, and teaching them photography skills. The children's photographs are also featured in the film, giving them a voice and a platform to tell their own stories. Overall, Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids is a moving and important documentary that highlights the need for change in the lives of children living in poverty and exploitation. It is a must-watch for anyone interested in social justice, human rights, and the power of art to make a difference."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),Such an inspiration!,"'Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids' is an inspirational and uplifting documentary, and proves there are still Good Samaritans out there trying to change people's lives. Such a Good Samaritan is Zana Briski, who went to Calcutta, India to film prostitutes in a brothel. But arriving there, she met all the children living in the brothel, and decided to do a documentary on them instead. These kids are living in dire circumstances, and are doing the cleaning and running errands - often until very late at night. Being a photographer herself, Zana decided to give the children cameras. She taught them how to use it, and the photographs they took gave her a good insight into their everyday lives - and their perception of the world. Despite their circumstances and very little opportunity, these kids dream of a better future. It truly is so sad seeing innocent kids growing up in places like this. With no help from the outside world, the girls sure are destined to become prostitutes, too. (Not sure what would become of the boys...) It was such a delight seeing the kids discovering the world outside their 'comfort zone', how they bonded, and how much fun they had 'just being kids'. Zana showcased their photographs at photography conventions in the hopes of raising money to provide for them, and to give them an education. I enjoyed watching 'Born into Brothels' very much. It shows us a very different side to life - quite frankly one we probably never care to think about, or even know exists. This was an eye-opener, and definitely thought-provoking. Well done to Zana Briski! 'Born into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids' received many accolades and won the Oscar for Best Documentary. Well deserved! Would I watch it again? Generally, I don't really give documentaries a second viewing, so I'll have to say no."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),"A very powerful, hard hitting documentary.","The reality of the streets in the Sonagchi, Calcutta brought to us by Zana Briski, seen through the eyes of the children. I set a challenge that I wanted to watch something very different, something out of my comfort zone, a friend gave me this dvd to watch, I thought it would be too upsetting, but I was surprised. Yes it's harrowing, the lives of the children, as a Brit I find it almost impossible to understand the living conditions and situation. What astonished me, the children, the happiness and attitudes of them, they were incredible. Fascinating culturally, the levels of poverty and the diabolical living conditions, this truly was an eye opener, but the one thing I took from this, was hope, the sheer hope and compassion inspired by Briski and others. The scenes with the camera, the look on their faces, I teared up. A film that really did take me out of my comfort zone, but I genuinely would recommend it. How cool would it be if they were to make a follow up, to return to the area, and see where those kids are now. 8/10."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),These Mean Streets,"While working on a film about prostitutes in Calcutta, Zana Briski noticed that many of the women had children who also lived in the brothels. To prevent them from following in their mothers' footsteps, Briski gave the kids cameras, urging them to document their life in the Red Light District. The project resulted in the documentary ""Born into Brothels"". While it's depressing to see the horrific conditions people are forced to live in, it's also a hopeful tale of children. Young girls and boys, who for the first time are given a chance to break free from a life of coercion and oppression. A final note: since the film premiered, Zana Briski has started a non-profit organization called ""Kids with Cameras"". The idea is to initiate similar projects in other countries around the world."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),Such a sad story about poverty and the class system in India.,"Not for the faint of hearted, because watching young kids in India, living in poverty and being outcasted by society because their mothers work in a brothel, is such a sad thing to see. The energy, the positivity and the many ways in which these young kids cope with their harsh surroundings is impressive and touching to see. A film about poverty, but also a film about hope of a better future, if young people are given a chance..."
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),A documentary that hard to review,This is really hard to review this documentary. Because plot of documentary is a human shame. If this movie is just about woman who forced to prostitute; most probably not get any nominee and any award at all. But considering children (really weak point of every human) it get an award. I am not completely sure that movie makers did this to easy way to get an Oscar (or award). Because when you consider cinematography it is really basic level. Most likely shoot and edited by amateurs. Therefore it is hard to review.
Born Into Brothels: Calcutta's Red Light Kids (2004),Sad and Adorable,"All over the world there are heart-rending events happening to children. In Calcutta, India Zana Briski documents the lives of about ten or so children who were born and raised in the brothels of Calcutta. There is virtually no future for these children except of poverty, and for the girls, prostitution. Zana teaches some of these kids photography just to give them some form of education, and for some it may be a way out of their predicament. She even helps some of them try to get enrolled into board schools, but everything she attempts is met with red tape and resistance. You want so much for these adorable little kids to be whisked away to a better life, but there's a part of you that knows that it would take a miracle for their lives to be any different. While sad, it is enjoyable to see these precious children with their beautiful smiles not be dragged down and depressed by their conditions."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),The Best Documentary,"This is one of the best documentarys.
Many people gave it negative reviews I don't know why?"
India's Daughter (I) (2015),The truth my country's governors denied and banned.,"India's daughter is not a film, but truth told out loud to the audience. It shows the lack of remorse the convicts had towards the heinous crime they committed.
It showed how their defense lawyers, people from a higher education background, defended rapist's actions. According to them, they did right by raping her, penetrating her using an iron rod, because an Indian girl should not roam around after 9. The lawyer said that a woman is meant to impart feelings of sex in men, and she got what she asked for.
The film is the truth about the mentality some people of my nation possess how they think of women as objects. Yes, there are these people here, and they come from the highest if educational backgrounds. They are literate, privileged, but they deserve nothing.
Probably that's why our home minister banned it. Because he knew it would tell people the truth - their incapability of bringing the poor girl to justice.
Watch India's daughter. Spread it and let the people know of what happened. Find how the police failed."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),British Broadcasting Corporation's subtle racism and condescending nature in full glory even after the end of colonialism.,"There should be another documentary which shows how the creator of the documentary blamed the BBC of selectively editing her more neutral work with global figures to purposefully show India in a bad light, this got the outrage of Indians and garnered huge social media popularity. At the end, the documentary's message is less important than the money made by producers and BBC."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),An eye-opening view into rape culture in India,"I've ticked the 'spoiler' box because I'm just going to talk about the entire documentary without worrying if I'm spoiling it for others. This was a very good documentary, but as another reviewer mentioned, it was very painful to watch. It was shocking to hear what many of the people interviewed had to say about the rape, and rapes in general - that it was mostly the woman's fault for being out and about at night without a family member as chaperone. That the men committed a brutal, life-destroying rape just to ""teach her a lesson"", so to speak. The documentary gives a little insight into the way Indian society works, at least in some areas - the rapists were mostly poor and grew up in areas of the country where brutal rapes and domestic violence against women were regularly witnessed. They grew up seeing it as just a part of life. It is perhaps no wonder that as young men they felt like it was their right to do as the men they grew up watching had done many times. It was mentioned that some of the men in prison had committed over 200 rapes. I felt very sorry for Jyoti's family, who have lost their daughter in such a horrific way. I also found the scenes of protests happening after the rape very emotional to watch. Particularly when the police ""fought back"", clearly threatened by this behaviour. Even though what happened to Jyoti is horrific, and I wish it never happened, something good has come out of it - a spotlight being put on rape culture in India, and more women (and the men who support them as well) starting to stand up for their rights and deciding not to take any more. All in all, this was a very well done but heartbreaking documentary."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),Read my review & say - None Sense documentary & 'ILL- LEGAL' movie.,"(1)Why the movie is non - sense ? -- Because, (i) It talks nothing about 'India's daughter', film spews trash & lies about life of Indian men/women & society as whole. (ii) Its moral duty of documentary producer & maker to tell a complete story! its very un-ethical to show selective/skewed clips , scripted dialogs & use anecdotes to make unfair generalizations & more over claims through this movie that - most Indian men mentality & society in general keeps women at feet & have pervert attitude towards women (which i think is absolute non-sense).How many of you male Indians (reading this review right now) share same chauvinist behaviour towards women around you ?(as shone in movie by convicts / 1 of lawyers?) film-maker  (2) Now let's talk about legality of movie, its impact on society & agenda of BBC / film-maker.  i) Impact- BBC & film maker is reflecting only 1 thing on society - 'NEGATIVITY' Film gives an international platform to rape convicts to share their sexual chauvinist views towards women & this in turn may inspire other perverts/prospective future rapists to do same. ii) Agenda- BBC & film-maker have been quite successful in selling- 1 spicy Indian rape story to earn TV rated points (TRP) for BBC channel & converting it into- money/fame by defaming Indians & fooling its audiences (Indians are only species on earth who self pity & applaud white film-maker for her criminal act, Indian mindset is full of inferiority complex. Non-stop Indian TV adverts of fairness creams are best example, whats wrong with brown skin ? stop praising white skin people for no reason, stop taking selfie photos with white foreigner tourists because they are not aliens from Jupiter! Stop applauding & giving special treatments to white skin British film- maker - everything white westerners does/says is 'NOT' gospel truth). How about making a movie on black under-age girl raped by bunch of whites in London tubes? well , that does not earn BBC 1 Billion fans nor can you manage to bring millions of Britisher's to protest on streets against 1 rape/crime activity, also you cannot make an illegal movie within U.K.itself & its quite hard to sell 1 rape story to Britisher's & claim London as rape capital of world. Inferiority complex filled Indians would never believe that story anyway. HAHA Legality -  Leslee udwin & BBC are cheaters-who broke Indian laws by making ill-legal film, went further to broadcast it without getting it certified by Indian motion pictures censor board, & thus - insulted Indian society/people & have falsely painted India as rape capital of world. Film-maker has also betrayed her Indian crew who helped her make this film, Mukesh (one of convict movie character) has filed police complaint where he claimed that he was compelled to ""speak the written script"", parents of victim also have filed police complaint because they never gave permission to show real name of their victim daughter & the graphic images in movie, Film-maker is 'WANTED' by Indian law court. she may have got away with her criminal act but no one can deny that she is a fraud & fugitive & it saddens me to see many Indians applauding her movie/criminal acts, mis-deeds. BBC needs self-introspection, because they broadcasted an ill-legal movie which was made by breaking laws of other countries."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),Not good enough.,"I was 17 when this incident happened when I was still in college. It affected me in ways I cannot explain. I remember being angry and every one I know was angry. People in my college organized prayers and vigils in the wake of the incident.We were told about the details of the this gruesome event. My own emotions went from uncontrollable rage to a feeling of powerlessness for not being able to do anything. ""Nirbhaya""(fearless) as we called her, was no different from my own sister who is also a med student. She was ambitious, affectionate and hardworking. The weeks following the incident were intense, everyone was talking about it. 2 to 3 pages on all major news papers were covering rape. I remember the older people saying it was nothing like they have ever seen. The trail was sped up and the perpetrators were sentenced to death. Rape still today is reported in the front pages of Indian newspapers. Its a real problem and there is still a very long way to go.The international media eventually took notice, and started reporting world wide. Then came the problem, people in the west have started taking notice and terms such as ""rape culture"" ""rape problem"" and ""rape capital"" started to emerge. I myself was called a rapist more than once on the internet by some one claiming to be from the west. Their intention of course(or hopefully) was that this would force the people/govt to act. This put people on the defensive, making them quote rape statistics which again made them look like they are denying the problem. I wouldn't go into details of how it is exactly hurting the feminist movement in India. Leslie udwin's movie somewhat seems to be along those lines. It was meant for an international audience hence it could have been more detailed. Some Indians saw it as demeaning and showing only a part of the country. The credit for highlighting this issue and forcing the Indian govt to change rape laws in the country goes to Indian feminist and the fight forward will be by them and them only. Not by keyboard warriors sitting in their homes in the west. Leslie udwin seems to me as nothing but an opportunistic person causing more harm than good. This film is not that well researched either. It doesn't tell the history of rape law in India or doesn't go into the details of the patriarchal mentality.It also doesn't tell the class divide in India either, where in how old and new India are clashing. To me it seems like a movie where people watching can go ""I'm glad that I wasn't born there"". No solution was presented. There was also some ""white"" lady from London describing India as if the producers can't find an Indian to do the job and do it better. ""Nirbhaya's"" ordeal is an eye opener, This country will never be the same as it was before this event. The solution to equality is long and difficult. Also, This documentary was banned in India because of the statements made by the person under death row. The first trail of these men was some what a media trail. The appeals court wants to make sure correct justice is served with out it being a media controlled event."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),Incomplete Documentary,"I had written this review on my google+ page after watching the documentary for the first time. I had just concluded watching Journalist Leslee Udwins documentary titled ""India's Daughter"". First of all I want to congratulate her for exceptional piece of journalism which bought issues of gender equality in India to the fore. There are not enough words that could convey the strong negative emotions I feel for the perpetrators of the heinous crimes, their motives and statements. Rape incidents should not be tolerated at all and the law should take its course. On the other hand I've also looked at this documentary comparatively. I was going through a wiki article that says annual rape rate in India is 2 per 100,000 people between 2008-2012 while the reported rape rate in United Kingdom, Ms. Leslee Udwin's own backyard, is 24.1 per 100,000. Moreover Rape laws in UK are not gender neutral. Im eagerly awaiting your next documentary about Rape Incidents in UK."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),"""A decent girl wouldn't roam around at 9pm...a girl is far more responsible for a rape than a boy""","India's Daughter is a very difficult film to watch. And hearing quotes like the one listed above during the course of the film is definitely unsettling. Now I am not saying you shouldn't see India's Daughter, you really should, but the film is difficult because it's about a horrible case where a young woman was gang raped and very brutally murdered. The details are very unsettling and what's more unsettling are many of the interviews--interviews which reveal a sad rape culture in which the victims are traditionally blamed for these vicious crimes. But I am glad the interviews are in this documentary because instead of a narrator talking about the incidence of rape and violence against women in India, it's the people themselves who talk--and that makes for a stronger, more impactful film. The story begins back in 2012. A medical student, Jyoti Singh, took some time from her very difficult schedule to go out with a male friend and enjoy a movie. On the bus ride back home in the early evening, the friend was beaten and Singh was gang raped by five men while their friend, the driver, drove them about town during this long and horrible ordeal. When they were finished with her, the men literally tore her to pieces and threw her and her friend from the vehicle. Miraculously, she survived several painful days--long enough to give testimony which helped authorities find the men responsible.  Fortunately, this case was not ignored or swept away. The Delhi police quickly began investigating and capturing suspects. At the same time, students from the nearby university took to the streets to protest this assault as well as to raise awareness of the prevalence of assaults in the country and the devalued role of women. In this country, the UN has estimated that there have been 50,000,000 cases of recent infanticide of females because folks often have so little regard for women. Likewise, violence against women of all types is largely condoned. As for the police, though they appropriately investigated the case, they also attempted to violently squash the protests. But, despite this, protests continued and occurred in other major cities in the country. The government was forced to do something. The story both outlines the series of events and allows many of the folks involved in the case to talk and give their side. Singh's parents, one of the perpetrators, several defense attorneys, government officials and rape activists all talked about the crime as well as the prevailing pro-rape culture...or, in some cases, made excuses to justify these rapes. In the case of Jyoti, she wasn't able to speak because of her death. One of the convicted men, however, blamed her as she was out late at night and said he and his friends were 'teaching her a lesson'! This is sick, but the lawyers were often even worse in the film, as one defense attorneys stated on two occasions that had Jyoti been a member of his family, he would have poured petrol on her and set her ablaze for being out at night...even if she was with a male escort! It's hard to watch and hear this sort of stuff and you'll likely be filled with anger as well as tears. However this is what makes this a great film--as exceptional documentaries are often great because they cause such a strong affective reaction within the viewer. You are angry and should be angry...and with anger, change is more likely to occur. A truly remarkable and important film, very well made and with an incredibly strong impact. Leslee Udwin has written and directed one of the strongest films of its type I have ever seen and even more remarkable is that this is the first time she ever directed a project!"
India's Daughter (I) (2015),Powerful Film,"This film is so powerful-- I can see why it has the support of Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn and Meryl Streep. It is hard to get it out of your head once you see it-- and you shouldn't, you should act and be part of this important movement. The editing was brilliant, the access unbelievable and the content quite horrifying. The events will hopefully move the world to change. Leslee Udwin does an fantastic job of not only telling this really difficult story. The film is just over 60 minutes but it feels like it ends at precisely the right moment-- when you want just a little more. Kudos to all involved. This could go down as one of the most important documentaries of this century and it would certainly be deserving."
India's Daughter (I) (2015),Not Sure why this is banned .,"First of all I don't know what exactly is offensive in this and whom it may offend. If we expect the accused to be respectful to women or not say offensive things towards women ( which even the defense lawyer so proudly supports), then we are bound to be disappointed. There has always been discrimination on gender basis in India , so nothing should be expected from these people.Actually not their fault most people are brought up with these values. Lady in the Documentary says education is the best way to tackle the problems India faces , but I think poor people for whom making both ends meet is a very difficult task and asking these people and their children to go for 'not so important' education' may be a difficult task. So if my opinion was to be taken it should more be about making strict laws,ensuring better law and order in the country and teaching our younger generations about equality not just on gender basis but on caste basis too . Controlling population would help too."
The Square (2013),"Shady, totally obvious propaganda movie","Watched about ten or twenty minutes. I just wasn't comfortable with the documentary. They student leaders all did not seem trustworthy. I mean, there was one guy from Britain who seemed like he was setting himself up to get some cushy position in the Egyptian government. I had serious doubts he cared about running the country properly. Basically, they were all portrayed as angels while Mubarak and others in the government were portrayed as the devil. Standard propaganda techniques are used, every shot of the student leaders shows them happy and smiling, every shot of Mubarak shows him stone faced and frowning. I really don't know that much about The Square and the result of it seven years later, but if I do some research into it, I bet I won't like what I find out about the characters from this film."
The Square (2013),I cried twice or more,"I cried twice or more I can't remember, all I remember I just saw an unusual documentary.
My heart couldn't see it any more. There is no word could explain the Jan 25, this documentary capture it from many respective and did what the best could been done"
The Square (2013),Powerful on the scene doc on The Light that Failed in Egypt in 2013,"""The Square"" of the title is Tehrir Square in Cairo, scene of all the major Egyptian protest demonstrations of the past two years. and this is a two hour long documentary on the Nightmarish 'Arab Spring' in Egypt, is an astounding personal summary of the events in Egypt from the fall of the Mubarak dictatorship in early 1991 to the rise and fall of the Moslem Brotherhood under ""legally elected"" Islamist president Morsi just a few months ago.
The intrepid female director, Jehane Noujaim, an American Egyptian filmmaker went to Cairo in January 2001 to witness the historical events taking place in her family's home town, but with no such ambitious film project yet in mind .... At the end, you may also understand it better than you did before. This fearless exercise in political reportage is also a formidable, if necessarily raw, work of political thought. Ms. Noujaim's sympathies are clearly with those who refer to themselves as ""revolutionaries"" - a word that comes to signify resistance to both the Brotherhood and the military - but she is hardly blind to their limitations. The revolutionaries are able to compel the world's attention and sympathy, and to risk life and limb in defiance of authority, but they have neither the organizational discipline nor the strategic ability to assume and exercise power. Lacking weapons or a party apparatus, they become pawns and bystanders in an increasingly lethal struggle between forces more ruthless and less principled than they. This is a tragedy, not only for Ahmed and his friends, but also, it's fair to say, for the Egyptian people as a whole. But ""The Square,"" while it records the gruesome collision of utopian aspirations with cold political realities, is not a despairing film. It concludes on a note of resolve grounded in the acknowledgment that historical change can be a long, slow process. It suggests that the Egyptian revolution, after a glorious birth and a blighted infancy, is still at Square 1."
The Square (2013),One of my favorite documentaries of the year,"The Square follows the Egyptian revolution of 2011 from the perspective of the ones that started it. The revolutionaries occupy Tahrir square in a strikingly peaceful protest and inspire the downfall of regimes ranging from a brutal military dictatorship to the muslim brotherhood, who manipulated voters using religion to gain unprecedented political power. This is a story that not many understood, it is a story behind the violence and turmoil that we've seen broadcasted briefly on the television. Egypt has been in constant political flux for most of the past decade. This film provides not just a comprehensive follow, through the events of the past three years, but also demonstrates an extremely intimate look at the revolutionaries responsible for what eventually became the biggest demonstration in history. These very modern political activists give a human face to the struggle of democracy in Egypt. The fact that these things happened very recently and are happening now make this film have a sense of urgency and extreme emotional impact. The goal of the revolutionaries is to create a government with a conscience, to replace the extremely repressive governments that come to power consecutively even as the people force the removal of old regimes. In summary this is not just the best documentaries of the year but one of the best movies of the year. It provides a wonderfully immersive look into egyptian culture and the problems facing it today and will leave you too demanding the fall of the regime."
The Square (2013),Incredible On the Spot doc of the Light that Failed in Egypt in 2013,"Viewed at Los Angeles Preview, Dec. 2013: ""The Square"" (Al Meidan). a new documentary thriller straight from the barricades in Cairo, has received the Best Documentary of the year award and has turned out to be one of the hottest film events of the tail end of calendar year 2013. PHOTO: Ahmad Hassan, young protester rides atop a triumphant crowd in Tehrir Square ""The Square"" (Tehrir Square in Cairo, scene of all the major Egyptian protest demonstrations of the past two years) a two hour long documentary on the Nightmarish 'Arab Spring' in Egypt, is an astounding personal summary of the events in Egypt from the fall of the Mubarak dictatorship in early 2011 to the rise and fall of the Moslem Brotherhood under ""legally elected"" Islamist president Morsi just a few months ago. Intrepid female director, Jehane Noujaim, an American Egyptian filmmaker went to Cairo in January 2011 to witness the historical events taking place in her home town with no such ambitious film project yet in mind .. The reality on the ground in front of her eyes in the very neighborhood where she grew up — with cataclysmic political changes already underway — prompted her to set up a team to record these unfolding events in proper professional style. She and her team stayed with the ongoing insurrection for two years, through thick and thin, focusing on the personalities of three central impromptu revolutionaries, while placing themselves directly in the line of fire. What emerges is a you-are-there documentary that is more cinema vérité than classical documentary — like news flashes from the front lines with a Hollywood thriller plot line to boot. Basically she followed three regular Tehrir protesters around, both on the street during life- threatening situations, and off the street in private interviews reflecting on the events in progress. One, Ahmed Hassan simply speaks straight from the shoulder with no pretensions whatsoever. Ahmed is an average guy who is convinced that the time for the common people to regain their dignity after decades of humiliation and oppression under Mubarak has finally come. He just happens to have the disarming charm and charisma of a Leonardo Di Caprio. Khalid Abdallah is a professional British actor of Egyptian background with a Cambridge degree. In 2006 he played the leader of the Arab hijackers in Paul Greengrass's 9/11 drama ""Flight 93″. In Jehane's Square he plays himself — an ordinary Egyptian with a conscience crying out for democracy. Khalid takes a more intellectual view than the others but is every bit as committed and willing to put his body on the line. His father back in England is also a longtime advocate of democracy for Egypt. We see Khalid talking to his father via SKYPE in UK to keep him abreast of happenings on the front line in the Square. The battle lines swing back and forth. After Mubarak is toppled an interim military junta takes over. Finally the Junta agrees to hold ""free elections""' however, as Hassan points out with surprising political savvy, the democratic minded opposition in The Square has no cohesive structure, so the choice becomes one between the fundamentalist minded Moslem Brotherhood, or a continuation of Mubarak style Military rule — in other words not much of a choice at all for the democracy minded activists who represent the bulk of the Egyptian populace. The Botherhood — the ""Akhwan"" — win by a slim majority and Morsi takes over — as a ""legally elected"" president. At first even Washington supports him, but it soon becomes clear that Morsi wants to install an Islamic Dictatorship. Watching Morsi attempting to assume dictatoriaĺ powers on television Ahmed Hassan remarks wryly, ""He's digging his own grave"" — and then leads another charge into The Square. This time Hassan is hit by live ammo and hospitalized, but he recovers quickly and the Moslem Brotherhood regime is also toppled. But what is the new alternative? The third central figure is Magdy, a personal friend of secular Ahmed but a committed Moslem Brotherhood believer. As events progress we witness his final disappointment and disillusion with the brotherhood in spite of his deep religious feelings. His own son is now an active demonstrator against Brotherhood oppression. At the end of the film, completed just two months ago, the military is back in the drivers seat and the nation is in limbo. In a final sequence the three main figures agree that the opposition is too unstructured and that what is needed is a new constitution — and a new consciousness — but this will take time to work out. As the year 2014 opens the situation in Egypt is still up in the air with the military cracking down severely, much as was the case under Mubarak. The question now is what is worse?– the military or the Islamists — and will democracy in some form still have a chance? On very limited release in November 2013 this amazing film was seen by almost nobody because NETFLIX who own the rights, allotted Zero publicity budget. However, The power of Jehane Noujaim's film is such that, if it gets an Oscar in March on top of the Best Documentary distinction already earned it may become an international cause celèbre and may then reach enough people to make a real difference on the ground — not only in Egypt but elsewhere as well. In any case this is a film absolutely not to miss simply as a cinematic adventure that is sure to become a landmark if and when the final chapter of the Arab Spring is ever written."
The Square (2013),Relic!,"First hand footage of the one of the most important political events in these times. All I can think is that we're very lucky to have these images that reconstruct such a story: kids start an important revolution that is hijacked by an organized religious group and see, in front of their eyes and their martyr-like effort shattered dreams of a democratic forward-looking country. With many countries following suit and falling in the same traps, this is a history lesson being unfolded in front of our eyes. The flickering and bad cameras cannot minimize the pure gold that comes from the screens. It's like having footage from the bastille or of the Russian revolution. A must see. A cautionary tale for all revolutionaries."
The Square (2013),inspirational Movie,"Most importantly, ""The Square"" brings cohesion and clarity to the story of Egypt's ongoing revolution since the Arab Spring that began nearly 4 years ago today. The film is structured into chapters of each power- shifting protest that has made its way into western media over the past few years, and we follow a few revolutionaries to get their perspectives on the reasons of each protest movement and their thoughts on the aftermath. Their words are as perceptive and inspirational as the footage shown of their fellow Egyptians, and by the end this documentary makes a cautionary and exciting case for both the future of Egypt and of ours as a global community. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""You will never be what you ought to be until they are what they ought to be."""
The Square (2013),Reel Look: 'Al-Midan' (The Square),"""The leaders play on top. The people pay the price for everything. The people always pay the price."" To commemorate the one-year anniversary of the political uprising and tragic bloodshed of an African nation demanding a justified revolution, this review will cover the inspirational, immersive and intense film known as 'Al-Midan' (The Square). However, did this documentary exceed in truly capturing the essence of a nation in one of its most dire eras? Let's take a look. Directed by Jehane Noujaim (Control Room), this 2013 Egyptian-American documentary depicts the ongoing roller-coaster ride of tumultuous political affairs, deriving from its roots back in 2011 in Tehrir Square to the summer of 2013. Casting its ballot of a budget at only $1.5 million, the unfortunate outcome was a return only slightly more than a tenth of that at the box office. However, the film did receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 86th Academy Awards and was the first film through Kickstarter (crowd-sourced) to do so. That may have been thanks to the five editors who worked on the film as well, not to mention the five ""additional editors"" and six assistant editors mentioned in the end credits, but who's counting? The Revolution in Egypt has been a continuing political drama over the past two and a half years. For most people, the news will only provide a glimpse of one of the bloodiest political battles, an election and a million man march. The handful of characters we do meet at the start of the uprising revolution discuss covering their own footage with cameras, as the news will only show so much. These maneuvers and a number of YouTube videos are our main characters' only windows of the outside world around them gone hellishly awry; ravenous for rightful restitution amidst streets slathered with rioters, tanks and tear gas. The characters we are introduced to are only a fraction of the tens of hundreds of thousands fighting for their voices to be heard in claiming their rights, including actor Khalid Abdalla (United 93) during the reign of the corrupt Muslim Brotherhood and the leering presence of the threatening Revolutionary.  At the beginning of the film, we witness the deposal of the fourth president, Hosni Mubarak, after his nearly two-decade long term. Now, political unrest has arisen and the people demand a new leader. When President Mohamed Morsi wins the election as the fifth president of Egypt, his abrupt term is halted after he grants himself unlimited powers on the pretext that he will ""protect"" the nation from the Mubarak-era power structure. He also gives himself the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts. In late November, he issues an Islamist-backed draft constitution and calls for a referendum, an act that his opponents call an ""Islamist coup"". These issues, along with complaints of prosecutions of journalists and attacks on nonviolent demonstrators, brings hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets in the 2012 Egyptian protests. It is these actions that erupt the nation into frenzy, with protesters by the millions calling for the resignation of Morsi. He is later tried for charges of incitement of murder and violence, along with espionage. As of now, the nation is hopefully awaiting a new leader who will indefinitely bring about peace and rest once again to the nation of Egypt. 'The Square' indeed does this daring documentary justice in capturing the raw, uncut footage and bringing it to vivid life not only as a picture of grueling chaos but also as an art form. Like the cuts to the mural of the wall in the film being painted every now and then, so too are the voices of the people in Tehrir Square in all of their varying colors. Many voices, one plea. Many colors, one portrait. Together the people forget their differences and stand as one by the thousands upon thousands to form their own ""wall"" that stands against the powers polluting their precious homeland. No matter how many ""bricks"" are lost from their wall, the people are all the stronger in their fight. The shots of a man's stretched, distorted face upon it being run over from a panzer or a young man assassinated for attending the protest without informing his parents first are daunting and grotesque, but they emphasize the desperation of a people seeking freedom. Even one of our main characters, Ahmed Hassan, gets a gash in his head from some rocks thrown at him. Some up-close shots in the film show the paint running in the heat down the wall, paralleling the people in the street sacrificing their blood for a dream they so desperately believe in. With each stroke of a brush, they too are painting the way on a path toward a democratic society and a brighter future. Like the mural, though unfinished, the revolution is a process, and getting there will be a long journey. Astonishingly intimate, courageous, complex and relentlessly gripping, Noujaim succeeds in risking a few years of her life to chronicle a giant mark in world history that is shown as deeply upsetting as it is yet ultimately hopeful to the viewer amidst an ever-shifting political culture. The two-year look at history in less than two hours is hard to digest at first but satisfactorily sums up a truly complicated and twisted predicament that one can only applaud afterward."
The Square (2013),The Square Review,"The Square is about an Egyptian Uprising. They want a new government with a new President. People should watch this to learn about what's happening around the world that a lot of us don't know about. The Square is about Egyptians living in Poverty, Injustice, and Corruption. What happens is the public protests in Tahrir Square (you don't have freedom of speech in Egypt) and is able to have President Mubarak step down. The public has completely filled Tahrir Square and the Military steps in to try and control it and then all heck breaks loose. I liked how dedicated these people are for fighting for what they believe in. I recommend this documentary to anybody who cares about what's going on around the world."
The Square (2013),The Square,"The Square was hard to watch. I could never imagine living somewhere, where the people in power are able to leave everyone poor and only provide for themselves. I could never imagine being uneducated for being poor. I could never imagine my country punishing me for speaking my mind and standing my ground. I could never imagine my Dictator having the military kill innocent people.This is a good example of when America should step in and do something to fix what they've allowed other countries to do.I was amused when they had an election to make others think they were changing to a democracy country. I would recommend this documentary to any one that is a revolutionary."
The Engineer (2013),El Salvador's shame,"El Salvador is ruled by two gangs . MS-13 and 18 street . Murder is an every day occurrence but there is a truce . Or is there ?
The truce is a smokescreen because all it means is instead of killings on the street the people are now going missing and being buried and there is only one man in El Salvador who retrieves these bodies and that's Israel Ticas -""The Engineer"".
This documentary is as draw dropping as they come . El Salvador is an horrendous place . This film shows just how death is just taken for granted. It seems only the parents and grandparents suffer . It's probably one of the most graphic films I've ever seen . You are witness to some horrific scenes including dismembered bodies and dead woman and children I want expecting that at all .
The Engineer himself is a likeable guy and takes death in is stride and that's probably what is the most shocking . How can these murders be the norm ?
As documentary's go it definitely very memorable but not recommended for anyone with a squeamish disposition."
Root Cause (2019),A documentary that EVERYONE needs to watch,"This is a documentary that everyone needs to watch. I can whole heartedly say that I am someone who has personally experienced the health issues and suffering from a toxic situation in my mouth which was then root canalled for it to continually breed bacteria and cause. It has caused catastrophic health complications a list as long as my arm. I was very fit, ate home cooked organic food, went to gym, ran 3 times a week, don't use chemicals on my body, loved hiking, yoga and the list goes on. Within 24 months of this infection I can barely get out of bed and now have nerve damage on my face inches away from the epicentre of my face and tongue to which I'm told my never recover. Mainstream medicine kept telling my the infection was fine and could not cause any illness. Yeah. That's what they said to me. Doctors, dentists and even the Werribee Mercy hospital. I wish I found this documentary sooner. Thankyou Frazer for bringing this to light."
Root Cause (2019),"Of course, this is a good movie, and finally something highlights the danger of one of the most pointless surgical procedures out there.","Anyone who voted this one, is definitely an endodontist or a dentist., And we know there are a lot of them out there. The people who gave it a 10 are all the patients who have been damage by root canal or leaving a dead tooth that is festering bacteria in the body. I have known hundreds if not, thousands of people who have had a but bad side effects from a root canal, and sometimes it goes on forever like in this story, and nobody even knows what's going on until they go to someone who understands the whole body, and how these dangerous toxic teeth stay in the mouth. It's actually not saving a tooth. It's leaving a dead tooth in the head. For any other organ in the body, we remove it when it becomes diseased. I know it's hard to lose a tooth, but this movie provides a real life example of what can happen, leaving down a path of auto immune diseases, and other sicknesses. At one time everybody was using mercury and teeth, and everyone said, it's perfectly safe, the dental industry said oh, mercury is the best thing, now no one uses mercury Because it's toxic. Why did we ever put mercury in teeth? I think one day and endodontist will be a thing of the past. A root canal will no longer be something that anyone will want any longer. Endodontist make at least $2000 per root canal tooth, and they don't give informed consent to the people who get them. I really could relate to what this movies message was saying. And it says a lot when they try to remove it from Netflix. Why silence someone? Where did free-speech go? I guess it goes to the special interest of the endodontist and the dentists. Don't silence the truth. Watch this movie, because it is a good representation of what thousands if not millions of people have endured."
Root Cause (2019),Give it a chance,"America is commercialized society. Companies will sale anything for profit. That also includes medical field. They fight off with great lawyers but after many decades and deaths things get banned by FDA. I have a mother With Neurological disease ALS. Doctors can't figure out cause of it. No medication at all for most of the nuro diseases. In commercialized society things slowly start shifting to non natural way. What we are using and eating some point in the future will be either changed or banned as we discover side effects. The words like Rare, un significant etc in medical field would make you believe that it is all okay to use it. Trust me I am dealing with paralyzed mother that breaks my heart every single day for last several years. My goal is to make people aware about toxins that play major roll in our lives. Go natural."
Root Cause (2019),Misogyny!,"I have been a dental professional for over 30 years. Dentistry is a male dominated field,laden with sexual harassment and ageism of female assistants and hygienists. The blond, sexy, assistant who looks like she is stripping, with the music to match, objectifies women. Yet, the males are portrayed as respectable professionals, of course with a token female dentist. We also see a half nude woman in bed who's only intent is to have intercourse, and our hero's redemption is complete when he is finally able to ""get it up"" to have sex with her. This stereotypical hypersexualization demonstrates the participants do not value people but are only interested in hype to sell their money making agenda. The rest of the content is bs, I am holistic but I can tell you this had to be backed by the new cone beam manufacturers (which are very expensive and not covered by insurance) and the new ceramic implant companies. Further, a bonded bridge will not hold and is subject to ingesting,choking, or aspiration. Every time you undergo any procedure (including removing a tooth) you are subject to infection, adverse reactions, and operator error. To invoke people to undergo additional surgery, rampant testing, infusions, etc, is just plain malpractice. The dental boards of each state need to investigate the dentists in this film. These people are looking for alternative ways to make profits from desperate people. My suggestion would be to ask for a guarantee if the ""treatment"" doesn't work."
Root Cause (2019),A movie by people who think they understand science,"This is a bunch of holistic pseudoscience bs. Get your medical advice from credible real medical professionals. By the way, I'm not a dentist so I'm not part of some conspiracy to discredit this movie."
Root Cause (2019),Follow Dr Joe Mercola,He referred me to this movie and supports the thesis. Science only advances by challenging outdated ideas. Dentists make big money out of toxic Mercury fillings & expensive root canal work and are slow to accept any concerns that may reduce their incomes. Today my dentist recommends ceramic fillings. Tomorrow he should recommend extraction rather than root canals🤞. The sooner the better.
Root Cause (2019),Very well made and eye opening,"The documentary is very well directed and is very eye opening. Every one deserves to watch this. Do get scared away by the bad reviews, they are part of a censorship."
Root Cause (2019),Solid expert analysis of the problems with industry of dentistry,"I found this documentary particular brilliant not only due to the content but also due to the fact that my own family have a long history in dentrisry and I know first hand that it is not an honest industry at all (it is all about profit) , which is precisely why I took the divergent path away from it, and it's no surprise to me that this film gets rated either 1 star or 10 stars by most other reviewers on here simply because its shining a light on a controversial matter and those that are working within the industry itself don't like the light to be shining on them in this manner."
Root Cause (2019),The spectrum of ratings should trigger you to watch this wether you agree or disagree.,"If you look at the rating you see about 49% lowest rating possible and the other 49% highest possible. That is enough reason to have a look at it because both ratings are incorrect. Simple excuses as ""no literature"" or ""there is no evidence"" do not trigger me at all because I know for a fact that the majority of pharmaceutical research is sponsored by parties that benefit from the results and there is enough data to be selective and manipulate the outcome. I watched the video because a have root canal treated tooth which is changing it's color, and I want to get it out anyway, it really looks like something is wrong there. The video gave me an extra reason to do this."
Root Cause (2019),Be aware of your dental health.,"People who call this movie provably never had serious health issues, but when you do have - you do everything and pay all the price to heal. I totally agree with the author story. I had root canal procedure only to find out 2 years later I developed 'infection' and teeth has to be removed. When they removed it - it appeared to be granuloma which could grow into cyst and seriously damage the jaw bone. Unfortunatelly it did not resolve my health issues, because ... I had another root canal which was missed by several dentists, because it didn't show on regular xray! And I had 7 of them!! I had serious problems with sinus infection, ear infection, pulling eye pain, trigeminal nerve pain and muscle spasm. Then developed chronic autoimmune condition out of 'nowhere' and mast cells activation syndrome ( which many dentists link to bacteria that appears in root canal infections, namely streptococcus aureus ). It appeared the root canal was causing sinus infection and chronic inflammation to the left side of my face. I excluded all other medical conditions, visited hundred specialists, been in hospital several times. The only thing left I did not treat - was the root canal. I had MRI scan 3 years ago and it showed maxillary sinus infection near the tooth root, 3 years later it developed into polyp ( with chronic pain on the left side of my face). So if you're 'mysteriously' sick and want to stay this way or spend thousands looking for the diagnosis - ignore this movie and move on with your life. But if you want to feel finally good - please check your root canals."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),"Typical Noam Chomsky fare, not necessarily a bad thing.","There's a lot of interesting information in there, but nothing truly new if you are familiar with Chomsky. If you are not, and are inclined to listen to his viewpoint, you will get some pretty good tidbits to think about. However if you fall on the opposite side of the spectrum there is not much in there you might find of interest. And that is why I am not giving a higher score here. While I am 100% in line with his views, objectively this documentary only offers Chomsky's one-sided analysis and commentary on how we got here and why things are the way they are without any kind of proposal on how we could fix the situation. Still a recommended watch."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Critique of the socioeconomic landscape of the USA,"This remarkable documentary is taken and ispired from the last long interview to the activist, thinker, historian, linguist Noam Chomsky in which he describes the socioeconomic landscape of the USA. The ideas that Chomsky systematically addressed in the documentary were compiled in the book ""Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth & Power"". This text, examinates the 10 principles of wealth and power concentration and reveals the elite and powerful minority, who thinks of their own interests. An unprecedented inequality in history. Tracing half a century of policies aimed at favoring the richest at the expense of the majority, the elimination of the American worker, the disappearance of the living wage, the collapse of the dream of owning a home, the skyrocketing costs of higher education that they make possible advancement unattainable or cause students to be chained to suffocating debts, and the loss of solidarity."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Absolutely stunning.,"Chomky is such an adept communicator. He diagnoses the problems with America as a country with pinpoint accuracy and shows how they've led to the chaos we're enduring now. What's so fascinating about this documentary is how simply it explains a lot of complicated philosophy and political economy by grounding the explanation in the current context. For example, Chomky doesn't explain Marx's idea of a class struggle or of the state being a tool for capitalists, but instead *shows* how that's the case in America today. He doesn't explain the anarchist idea of eliminating hierarchy or of justifiable power, but instead explains it in the context of Americans' average experiences. As someone who's read the theory, I was not only able to understand where he was drawing from, but also gained numerous new insights into it. This is powerful stuff."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Way out,"Certain things in society seem quite unfair. And the documentary does shine a light on things that can be described as inhumane or not considered for the overall population! Yes this focuses on America, but we know it is true for the rest of the world too. Now when it comes to solutions, you may be or feel a bit dissapointed ... but it would have been way too good if we had an answer for econimic inequality and all that. Those in power, at least most of them, are not interested for things to change ... and those below are either too indifferent, too preoccupied or plain too powerless to change anything ... it'll be interesting to see if anything changes in my lifetime ... I highly doubt it."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),A must see,"A must see to understand why most U.S. citizens are trapped and cannot pursue the ""American Dream"""
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Really? This is the brain trust intellectual?,"I was led to believe Chomsky was intelligent, this film showed that was a lie. Yes, i watched every second hoping for some redeeming aspect. Most of his logic had no track to a cohesive conclusion beyond money=bad. He glorifies some of the worst civil rights offenders, and vilifies others by tearing quotes from context. The cogent points he does make are likely by accident. Most everything else he says is self contradictory within the documentary, or has been radically redefined five years later to fit the morphing agenda. Maybe I need to go back a few decades before dementia clouded his judgment? Best part is how an anti capitalist hit piece is totally funded by interruption ads. Go ahead and down vote me; I've seen what you cheer."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Noam Chomsky for better or worse,"This movie will not change the minds of most people, you either like him or don't, so this feels a bit like preaching to the choir. Nevertheless he is a fascinating character and it's always a delight to hear him speak, even if I don't agree with everything being said."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),A resounding success,"Now, this is more like it. The filmmakers of REQUIEM FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM take a back seat and keep a low profile and simply let their subject speak, what with Mr. Chomsky being fascinating enough to carry a documentary on his shoulders. Granted, some of what is discussed here can be a bit circumlocutory and abstractive for the average person, but for the most part it makes perfect sense and important points are made. For decades now, this especially discerning and cerebral secular sage -- a man who has spent much of his life scrutinizing and comparing newspaper editorials, and commenting on the influence of Big Media upon the masses -- has been emphasizing just how propaganda functions within a democratic society. This exceptional talkfest is one that I would recommend to anyone not already familiar with Chomsky's work. We learn, for instance, what the power elite or global Plutonomy think of us commoners: as know-nothing plebeians and ignorant peasants, whose only purpose for living is to consume. Chomsky talks about the injustices that have occurred as a result of U.S. foreign policy, of wage slavery, monopolies and conglomerates, economic exploitation, stage-managed elections, how things like professional sports are somewhat designed to distract and keep the have-nots from thinking, as well as his views on free association and the importance of the alternative media. This is not a long documentary, nor does it need to be. In certain respects, it works both as a fine introduction as well as a fitting conclusion."
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Ameriu policies explained in a nutshell,"Through this documentary i learned so much about a lot from economy to politics , and the way the professor Noam Chomsky explains it ,it just great!"
Requiem for the American Dream (2015),Capitalism and economic equality - absolutely relevant right now,"Intellectual Noam Chomsky gave interviews for over four years to explain his views on capitalism and economic inequality. U.S. politics are dominated by wealth, which furthers the corporate agenda. He had relatives involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union that exposed him to many tragic, political truths. In this documentary, Noam explains how in America, people have been directed to superficial things as a way to ""keep the rabble in line."" Rather than encouraging people to make rational choices, consumerism creates uninformed consumers who will make irrational choices. I leaned in to soak in Noam's Ten Principles of corporate wealth and power that explain the history of the corrupt American socio-economic-political systems. It's not new information, but it's clearly presented. I planned to rewatch and take notes since there is much of importance to digest during this election cycle, but I don't have time right now. I recommend this excellent movie. *Noam's Ten Principles* 1) Reduce Democracy
2) Shape Ideology
3) Redesign the Economy
4) Shift the Burden
5) Attack Solidarity
6) Run the Regulators
7) Engineer Elections
8) Keep the Rabble in Line
9) Manufacture Consent
10) Marginalize the Population The lawyer Alan Dershowitz called Chomsky a ""false prophet of the left."" Chomsky called Alan Dershowitz a complete liar"" who is on ""a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),Fascinating and well made,"The inside look at activist groups fighting the AIDS crisis told with archival fly on the wall footage and remarkable access. It's hard to watch at times and doesn't always put the players in the best light, but it's a very worthwhile look at what happened for anyone not alive then."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),A good snapshot of an earlier era,"This U.S. documentary exposes the history of ACTUP (AIDS Committee To Unleash Power), an activist group that began in 1987 to fight against government apathy towards people suffering with AIDS. This subject has shown up in documentaries rather frequently lately including ""We Were Here"" and ""Vito"". Those other documentaries were very powerful in getting to the viewer's heart; this new film gets down and dirty and shows, via recorded camcorder footage, the extreme anger that was needed to get government action to get drugs that could prolong life for those living with the disease. Tensions within the movement are also exposed. Such anger would be dismissed in modern times as going too far. But considering the many who were ill, dying, and losing eyesight in those difficult times, the in-your-face approach was needed for true action especially when prejudice was also a factor. Sadly though, there are very uncomfortable moments when members of government institutions are being directly confronted and accused of murder. This seems very unfair yet one wonders if it was the only approach left to try to get the drugs to prolong life - drugs that became available in the mid-1990s. This rhetoric would later morph into the extremes of political correctness that also arose in the early 1990s. It became a royal pain as it was used by many other people and groups who exaggerated their victim-hood if they had any to begin with. Perhaps, this will be the subject of a future documentary. Most effective in this film was interviews with the surviving activists and their outlook on what happened in the nine years of that movement before better drugs were invented."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),Inspiring,Film record of New York activists' momentous struggle to have AIDS drugs made available while they and those around them were dying from the virus. Incredible and important documentary footage. But also heartbreaking personal stories of the devastation caused by the disease. Ultimately uplifting so don't be put off by the subject. It is left till near the end to reveal who actually survived the plague as they sum up those terrible years till '96/'97 and the difference their activism made. Inspiring.
How to Survive a Plague (2012),The beautiful story of a movement to save homosexual men and women's lives...,"How To Survive A Plague beautifully captures the story of young gay women and men as they fight against AIDS. The movie follows two groups, ACT-UP (Aids Coalition To Unleash Power) and TAG (Treatment Action Group) as they fight to bring awareness and find a cure for AIDS.  Through interviews, home movies and footage of the protests, you meet multiple gay men and women who have contracted AIDS and are fighting for their lives. They organize and attend multiple protests to bring awareness to the AIDS epidemic while also trying to find a cure. Without any scientific training or experience, they educate themselves on the dangers of AIDS, how the disease works and their treatment options. Many begin to sell, buy and use drugs not approved by the FDA in an effort to save their lives. While at the same time pushing the FDA and pharmaceutical industry to test and approve new drugs at record time.  Throughout the time this film covers, you get a true insight to the discrimination they faced, the fear they felt, and their struggle to stay alive. Many of those featured in the movie end up dying after contracting the disease, very accurately capturing what those in the homosexual community were facing. You can truly see the passion and effort these men and women put into finding treatment for AIDS.  However, the footage of the protests begins to become repetitive and boring. I also would have preferred if there was more of an explanation of how the medications work. The explanation you get is very brief and seems out of place in respect to the rest of the movie. Overall, this movie does a wonderful job highlighting the work done by ACT-UP and TAG to advocate and find treatment for AIDS. It's a must see for anyone looking to educate themselves on the AIDS epidemic in America."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),PBS Telecast: The Good and the Bad,"This documentary was shown by PBS, in my area, on Monday 12/30/2013. That was GOOD, since otherwise, I would not have watched it, because I didn't even know this 2012 documentary even existed. The BAD part of it, is that PBS showed it from 11pm to 12:30pm, therefore they showed a close to a 1:30 hours documentary and the running time of it is 1:50 hours. That's 20 minutes of footage missing from the original documentary, which was filmed with a running time of 110 minutes. Documentaries are usually well edited, that's why there is always a lot of ""extras,"" deleted scenes and so on. GOOD for PBS for showing it, but BAD (very bad) for cutting 20 minutes from it."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),Staggering,"David France's documentary following a small group of gay activists relies heavily on archived videography to capture the essence of what we know today to be the most efficient drugs in the halting of the HIV virus. Starting in 1986, a group of homosexual men (including Peter Staley and Mark Harrington) are recently diagnosed with the HIV virus, along with many of their peers, and actively protest the government – and specifically the FDA – to come up with a drug. Or better still, a cure. The group becomes known as ""Act Up!"" and quickly – some may say even like a virus – spawns a lot of active participants as they lose their jobs (health insurance), mortgages (ironic, considering the first four letters of that word) and future (i.e. none), rustle up enough cash and embark on the biggest battle against the oncoming zombie-like apocalypse. This plays like a movie, with its requisite three acts. The final plot point is staggering – and too late for many of our journeymen who die along the way. The mostly historical footage comprises to make this seem as if we're in a time machine; digging out old VHS tapes and revisiting the past. We suspect many of these youngsters won't make it, but will go down with a fight. George Bush Snr, Jessie Helms, all try their best to don the antagonist's shoes. It's like a Michael Moore propaganda piece, but this time, Mr. Moore's affected. And not central stage. That final twist (occurring as it does around 1995) is gobsmacking, but exemplified into the curiously hitherto-unseen narrators of the movie. After absorbing death, illness, frailty – a future promised to our visual on screen protagonists – France wisely saves his best trick for the last twelve minutes. It's a triumph of storytelling through the documentary medium. The postscript here is bittersweet. Once you've won the fight, and fought for your future – where do you stand, now? And yes, there's the old ""but the Catholics don't advocate contraception"" but wisely this is kept to a minimum. How to Survive a Plague wisely circumvents the religious debate – a tactic employed by Act Up, and then by its sister offset TAG, and actually garnered results for many. But for some, not soon enough."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),Great and extremely sad film. Glad that I stumbled upon it.,"What a great documentary.  Such incredible people. Their courage and strength will be imprinted on others forever. I watched it last night and I can't stop thinking about it today. So beautiful how the community came together to try and save each others lives and so sad that so many died and so many were left with grief. I think Iris was hugely instrumental in the whole take off of the movement. Good on her for caring enough to do something about it. Very well put together story. Glad that I watched this, I am going on a trip to New york this year and it will give the visit a bit more meaning for me."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),"If my rating was based solely on the people in this documentary, I'd give them all a 10 for their courage and perseverance","Seeing this title I was expecting something of an apocalyptic, end-of- the-world zombie type film. In fact, this documentary was far truer, exploring a disease which has cost many lives. One might say I have an interest in LGBT causes and maybe this is why I decided to see this documentary, but AIDS is not exclusive to any community. This documentary starts in the early 80's in New York where young men and women are dying of AIDS. There is no treatment and they are even refused in the hospitals. Each with their individual pain couldn't do much so they organized and created ""ACT UP"" whose main focus was to be an activist group, which through civil disobedience would bring attention, awareness, and most importantly a cure to AIDS. The documentary retraces some of their fights and quarrels mostly through archives but also with some more recent interviews. It covers some of the darkest hours before the discovery of the lucky combination that would prolong the lives of many, but would come too late to save those of many more. I think the topic is one of the most important there is. It feels so distant but I can actually remember hearing about a treatment to AIDS back then. It meant very little to me at the time. I can't say that I really loved the way the documentary was going about things but I liked the substance very much. It is very scary to think back and imagine those people taking whatever medication that was on trial simply because at that point it couldn't have done more harm. While I think activism is double-edged blade and can sometimes backfire, it seems that this very activism has saved many lives and the alerted politicians who at first refused to talk about how many lives AIDS had taken. There are some very emotional personal stories here, and if my rating was based solely on the people in this documentary, I'd give them all a 10 for their courage and perseverance through this tremendous pain. I liked: The topic. Historically important. I disliked: The shaky archive footage, the constant shouting and confrontations. It had only one sequence to explain the actual biological/chemical aspects, which I felt were important and deserved more screen time.  74/100 A little over 20 years ago, there were presidents who would go on television and say that AIDS has behavioral causes that should be looked at. This documentary could definitely teach them a thing or two."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),not very interesting,"After having been very surprised and impressed with the AIDS documentary We Were Here, I thought I'd check out this one too. Unfortunately I found myself very disappointed. The documentary follows the political activism of ACT UP and TAG, and doesn't stray very far from that main track. The filmmakers took a clear political stance on the side of the activists, and much of the documentary smacks of ""preaching to the choir."" Serious issues are not always taken seriously, and public figures such as George Bush Sr. and Jesse Helms are openly mocked by both the people in the documentary and also the filmmakers themselves. My main disappointment involved the documentary's focus, which fixed unwaveringly upon the activists. To be fair, this might be a good thing if you happen to be interested in ACT UP and TAG. But some websites (e.g. wikipedia) misleadingly suggest that the documentary also discusses more generally the early period of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. In fact, rarely do the filmmakers show us anything beyond the activism itself. It does not delve into any serious scientific issues, nor does it help us understand the early development of attitudes and expectations people had regarding HIV and AIDS. Also note that it only covers the years from 1987 onward. So we don't get to see anything at all about the beginning of the epidemic in 1981-1986. Maybe others would appreciate this film, but I did not enjoy it at all. Even for those who are interested in the subject matter, it's hard to imagine this being a compelling documentary. But for those of us who aren't already interested in this particular thread in the history of AIDS, it falls even flatter. It's not as bad as some documentaries, but I certainly don't recommend it either. Sorry to be so negative, but that's just how I see it."
How to Survive a Plague (2012),"In some cases, words and actions can save a million lives","""How to Survive a Plague"" takes real footage from the 1980s and 90s fight for health among the homosexual community and allows us to accurately re-live the tragedy of the rise of AIDS worldwide and the political incompetence to do anything about it. Part of the excellence of this documentary is allowing the actual events to speak for themselves. These activists had the foresight to record their conversations and protests, and these filmmakers had to foresight to know how to edit it to leave the power in the hands of those fighting. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) was formed in New York in 1987. Establishing Larry Kramer as its spokesperson was one of the many smart moves this advocacy group made. He's well-spoken and he knows his facts. Approximately half-way through the film, Larry stands up and delivers a speech so Earth-shatteringly accurate, simple and poignant that the entire audience in the room and the entire audience for the film are left speechless. There are times during this fight where the group dissipates and internal disagreements arise, and even though a separate group formed, this community stuck together and the emergence of TAG (Treatment Action Group) just doubled their efforts and accomplishments. AIDS patient and homosexual activist Peter Staley was one of the heroes of the film and is likely a personal hero to many. At the beginning, he was young, passionate and out-spoken but he knew his facts and could beat any politician in a debate. Just because he was gay, dying of AIDS and inexperienced doesn't mean he doesn't know what needs to get done and doesn't mean he doesn't know how to do it. Although these struggles took place 20 years ago, it's still inspiring.  They fought against the Catholic Church and judging by the look on the Bishop's face, they won. They fought against the FDA, and won. They fought against the NIH, and didn't really win. They fought against President George H.W. Bush, and the result was basically pounding their head against a brick wall, but at least they made out on his golf course lawn. They fought against President Bill Clinton, and at least they learned their lesson about debating a Rhodes Scholar. More importantly, they learned that it doesn't have to be a fight, and all advocacy, political and governmental groups worked in harmony. But by this time, it was indeed a plague and survival was the only option. The film had some fascinating facts but unfortunately they were written with a flickering green font on a grey cityscape background and were barely legible. But listen to what they have to say, and ACT UP and TAG will teach you ""How to Survive a Plague""."
Four Horsemen (2012),Melodrama & hyperbole matched with stock images & stock music,"Four Horseman is painfully dated, now (2023), in content and style. It suffers from the inherent sense of self-righteousness behind the motive and efforts. The 'analyses', such as they are, obviously (per the title) come from a Euro-Christian privileged perspective, thus the narrative - usually backed by melodramatic music - hides it's stridency in an annoying near-whisper; he sounds almost too tired to continue. There are several genuinely insightful and important thinkers and ideas presented here, but few if any lines are followed in depth. Four Horseman portends to profundity, but is actually a documentary version of the teenaged kid on the street corner, pushing pampletized solutions to the world's problems on every passerby. They think their epiphany and received wisdom is unique in world history, and they feel compelled to share every superficial idea with gravity of earth-shaking impact. There are better treatments of each of these basic ideas, with much less hyperbole and far better analyses. Four Horseman is really just a bit of candy for the outraged: it offers no real solutions and predetermined conclusions in place of analysis. Though dated, it's still fair to recognize that it's a wasted opportunity."
Four Horsemen (2012),Not a socialist treatise on the iniquities of capitalismp,"I do wish I'd watched this five or six years-ago - but maybe I wouldn't have appreciated it then. It's a little bit like 'Zeitgeist' except that it's all real, with genuine experts who - bar one, are cart carrying capitalists, so it isn't some socialist treatise on the iniquities of modern capitalism - it's a capitalist treatise on the iniquities of modern capitalism. It explains our parlous predicament very clearly, and suggests how we might be able to survive it and prepare ourselves for the future that we all sense is coming."
Four Horsemen (2012),"Negatives aside, it's totally worth watching.","FOUR HORSEMEN is an interesting documentary, well worth a watch for most..  As reviewers have mentioned, yes, it does try to cover a few too many topics in just over 90 minutes. But for the average person, a lot of the longer, more conspiratorial, more biased 'world order' YouTube documentaries are far too long and convoluted. Stylistically, it won some plus points with me for the smooth, easy to understand narration, but lost some for, as others have said, the slight lack of cohesion between sections, points and arguments. One last downside - on reflection, although I enjoyed the upbeat tone of the conclusion in that 'all is not lost, we can actually change things', I agree with others that the solutions put forward are potentially not viable. That said, I think some reviewers denigrate it unfairly, a documentary is meant to document the truth and put forward observations, a narrative - the documentary makers (especially these who are not huge mainstream corporates) do not make the policy, and are not even influencing those who do, so I think it's acceptable for them to put forward suggestions, right or wrong, for the viewer to look into. FOR THE POSITIVES! Overall, this documentary should probably be, in part at least, viewed by 90% of western civilisation who are not in finance or government and have no idea that this is going on. Those of you watching this or planning on it probably already have an idea, but think of how many around you really believe what their politicians tell them - we all know plenty. Whether you agree with every opinion demonstrated or not, it's an eye-opening and worthy use of 90 minutes."
Four Horsemen (2012),Unnecessary critic made above... Documentary was average but...,"They are also the guilty ones for terrorism: They make farmers poor, that justify them to be terrorists.  --> You have a well known Najma Sadeque; a researcher and prominent women's rights activist ""From the World Bank and IMF, and made from grounds from western countries, they;ve all gone (the finances) to benefit the elite and feudal classes. They have not benefited the ordinary people.  Experts from nations who are an authority should be accepted to a certain degree to accept the claims made by John Perkins.  Another example is that of terrorism: Lord Ahmed of Rotherham -First UK ; & Kaiser Bengali an Economist and Adviser to the Chieft Minister of the Government of Sindh.  If they really wanted to flush them out (the terrorists), there was no need for a huge military operation in Swat causing the entire district to become internally displaced persons. The population of Swat is (now) 1.8 million and 2.3 million refugees in the country. If they really want to get the terrorists then they should have carried out a clandestine operation ""... Well said... This is the height of evidence you can get from any average documentary."
Four Horsemen (2012),"good description of the problems, flawed solutions","This is worth watching more for it's cautionary value than it's message. It does a good job describing what has become of America since the Great Depression, but bases it's viewpoint on the naive idealism of the libertarian - blaming the problem on straying from ""classical"" economics and advocating a return to the gold standard and demonizing debt as the root of all evil. At least it admits that regulation is a good thing. It does do a good job of pointing out that libertarians and progressives share a fair amount of common ground, and might make a reasonably functional coalition against the establishment neocons and neolibs, who have already started becoming very friendly with each other, as evidenced by the current primary election shenanigans."
Four Horsemen (2012),more solution,"This is a well done, top notch documentary on the problems of the world, specifically the American Culture. There have been other docs made as well equally as informative. However, like the others is just more about the problem. Ah Media, when you all realize how much power you have to influence, you will begin using that power for the betterment of us all. Spend time on the problem and you perpetuate that. Spend time on the solution and you perpetuate that. I challenge you, now, to spend just as much time if not more on a documentary showcasing the solution because right now we have way too much momentum going in the ""woe is me"" direction. Oh Media, you also must realize that YOU are The Solution. It is up to us only to continue to make you aware of that power, for you are after all, the Voice of the People. Until you realize and act on such power, all we can do is focus on the solution as it applies to our own small, tiny, individual universe. For I can only affect my life and my world, your life and your world are your responsibility. It's just the way its meant to be. Alas Media, we call you to step up and use your mighty strength for all that positive and good."
Four Horsemen (2012),Wrong in one crucial aspect - GOLD,"Truly impacting statements from people who have been in, or close to, positions of power, +great thinkers,denouncing the way things work up-top and the deficits and unsustainability of our global financial and political constructs. BUT - I certainly frowned at about 10% of the movie. Yes, fiat money is baaad. But do these reborn visionaries really suggest, we should go back to the gold standard? Because of the predictable grow mining of gold? REALLY? WTF? Civil society in my country just dodged a bullet, stopping big-money corporate interests, political corruption, etc that comes with opening up ""the biggest gold mine in Europe"". Vast landscapes destroyed, a cyanide lake for centuries to come, broken up communities, increased health risk in the area is what gold mining leaves behind. I invite the readers, and ""visionaries"" in this film to google the images of a few gold mines. Does his f*** up planet need more goldmines just to store yellow metal in vaults? Is this the forward-thinking way you suggest? An e-currency like Bitcoin, if regulated, can achieve exactly the same predictable economical stability effect like mined gold. So really, dig on that a bit, and welcome my rating of 3, that would otherwise have been a nine. This aspect is simply unforgivable."
Four Horsemen (2012),"Weak -- same format, no originality--","The Corporation-- seen it, End of Poverty --Seen it. Inside Job--seen it This social conscious genre is starting to all having in the same exact people saying the same exact things done the same exact tired way. Even the cover art is like the Corporation. How many more films on Sub-prime immorality?  The Voice over and the script for the narration is solid but let down by the format. And the same face contribute very little to the story to make this unique. The best themes seem under explored. The old ones over explored (again).  Someone said it was shot on a budget, but you do not need much money to shoot talking heads on a black background. How many times will this try cookie cutter filmmaking format visit us?"
Four Horsemen (2012),The real Zeitgeist,"This movie captures the real spirit of the time. Without conspiracy theories, Illuminati and even without radical ideas it presents the causes and solutions to the problems we're facing today. It is like the Zeitgeist movies but much more logical and insightful. Instead of provoking fear it provokes thought - going as far back in time as the collapse of the Roman empire and as far in the future as the collapse of the Western global empire. Which is actually just around the corner. There are no secret societies, aliens, demons or specific ethnic groups that are to blame. The problem is in the system and if we remove its head it will just grow another one. The problem is in all of us and all of us are to blame for tolerating the system. And change is not so difficult. The movie offers classical, realistic and tested solutions like the gold standard of money and taxation based on consumption and resource extraction instead of income. And there's optimism in the end. Just like Guthenberg changed the world and ended so much suffering with a simple invention - the printing press, another invention is now causing a new Reformation and Enlightenment. The internet is the new printing press and neoclassical capitalism is the new feudalism and the new Inquisition it is fighting. In the end ideas prevail over greed. Perhaps this time it will happen with less bloodshed."
Four Horsemen (2012),A must see!,"A really good and worthwhile documentary that scratches the surface and point out directions. It's all over the Internet by now so take your time and rewind and dig deeper on your own. The gold standard and abolishing of income taxes might be areas that can be further explained, and the terrorist section needs to take religious fanatism into account.  It's most important message is that we all need to understand the current unsustainable economic system and collectively take responsibility and start the changes from beneath.  And as a side note: I don't know what film user ""rune-andresen"" have seen, but it can't have been this one."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Terrible Production,"The score is for the very poor production of this movie. It is truly unfortunate that the style of film completely detracts from the essential information being covered. Constant music. Jumpy editing,. It all translates too much like a small conspiratorial youtube production. This is a huge mistake! If the movie wants to be taken seriously. Cover the information seriously! The movie completely lets down the book. If this had been put together properly if would have had a chance of reaching a mainstream audience but this simply is not good enough. This should be remade. There is enough information for a series . I was truly angered by the conspiracy style chosen to convey this information. Read the book, forget this below par movie."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Everyone needs to open their minds!,"We have been so programmed in believing what we are told without doing our own research that we as a society have been dumbed down & blinded by the real truth. These kinds of documentaries are also being touted as ""conspiracy theories"". It's time for everyone to really take this information to heart. Tragedy & Hope & The Committee of 300 (either reading the books or listening to the YouTube audiobooks) have opened my eyes to how we are being lied to. Thank God some of us want to fully hear all the information possible on these subjects so we can actually learn both sides & make our own decisions. In my opinion Fauci should be charged for crimes against humanity. I hold him personally responsible for the death of my best friends husband with AZT!"
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),one of the most important documentaries of our lifetime,"This doco is one of the most distributing and enlightening films I have ever seen. The courage it takes to make a film like this cannot be overstated. I hope anyone who wants to know what happened to medical bio ethics during the pandemic watches this films and learns just how rotten and corrupt the WHO, fauci, bill gates and the vaccine companies and the mainstream news and big tech are and how they actively colluded with eachother in lock step to deceive and censor the truth about these harmful vaccines. They have had more injuries and deaths from the covid vaccines then all other combined!!!"
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Fauci never should have been able to continue,"Many who were not alive to remember the 80s will call this conspiracy or call this a money scheme but the documentary was free for anyone to watch for weeks. Purchase optional. I purchased, I remember the 80s Fauci has blood on his hands from The AIDS epidemic. He never should have been allowed to continue. I remember hands across America, I remember the quilt, same playbook different decade. Dallas buyers club will explain how it was the same squash down the therapeutics push the expensive drugs that kill people. This man should never have been allowed to continue. So many lives broken or lost, so many families broken. If you give this a low review and throw a tantrum I will pray for you, you need light not darkness. Conspiracies are only theories until they are backed by facts. Then they become just Conspiracies. Definition of Conspiracy and definition of theory. You will find it isn't so much a slur when it is backed by fact and proven true with evidence."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),"How Pig Farmer Tony ""beelzebub"" Fauci is not as nice as he looks","These conspiratorial, unhinged, I'll have two extra downie ones Mike, directors are really something. They raise money from the dim believers and make a comedramocumentary that shows only that they have really gone off the rails. This conspiracy theory flick is based on the tired paranoia of the right and is so improbably stupid that even the braindead incels lining up to gie it 10/10 can't save it from the ceulluloid sewage farm that will inevitably recycle it into a biopic about MJT or a puff piece day in the life movie about Matt Gaetz. The story: Bill Microsoft, tired of pushing his money around in his fleet of solid gold diamond encrusted wheelbarrows decides to infect the world with a killer virus with his evil buddy Fauci (pronounced Far -key) and the help of BIg Pharma, BIg Tech, Big Trans and Big Government. Lucky there is Big Conspiracy backed up by Big funding from the rich shadow donaters to the GOP. But enough, we're not size queens, lets cut to the chase: Is the real Anthony Fauci likely to win an Oscar? Not likely if BIg liberal Hollywood has anything to do with it. Like the sore losers hawking the big lies, you can be sure that anything but wholesale acceptance of this crock of crap will be blamed on BIG cancel culture, big jewry, the illuminati's secret hand signs and Soros Panda Express Hilary all your kids are belong to the liberal trans Europe express snip and tuck all your bits cos we coming to 'sition y'all humanity....and that means they will be saying they were robbed by Joe ""where's my uppers, no not the teeth, the pills"" Biden.. Whatevah, its just another grift."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),A sweet taste of truth,"Although some people may be eating their hearts out, liars, cheaters, manipulators and mass-murderers always come out sooner than later. Thank you to all of the great cast of hosts (can I say that?) that made this happen. And unlike the Moon landing, you don't need to fabricate and manipulate video clips. It is all public domain, anyone can see what Dr. Fauxy has said and done in his own words. Joe Rogan and Russel Brand who somehow survived the censorship and attacks from the left, boldly went when most men don't go today, which is publicly exposing their true views on today's most important issues of the material world......which is not so important after all. But, if good men do nothing, snotty children will take over and send us all to the fireslide of extinction. Now I want to see a documentary, Fauxy's last days in prison. Thank you,
God is Beautiful."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),A Real Eye Opener,"A very well researched documentary about Anthony Fauci. This documentary is not only about Covid-19 and the pandemic, it is about how big Pharma, the government, Bill Gates, Fauci colluded with the media to hide facts to the American people. It also gives a history of our government's involvement in handling infectious disease from the days of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s to the present. There is so much to this story and most people are naïve and ignorant about what is really going on. I highly recommend this documentary for its in-depth, eye-opening, exposé of an individual and the groups it serves I. E. Big Pharma, Bill Gates, etc."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Hilarious,"Do you like conspiracy movies? Then you would love this. This movie has all the unintelligent paranoia you are looking for. It's like watching Loose Change with less logic. It's not as funny as 2000 Mules, but more paranoid with even less substantial connections somehow. I think the movie is funny, and it is worth a watch for that, but if you're looking for information, which you aren't, I don't see why you would watch this. This is the perfect movie to watch if you want to turn off your brain and laugh to yourself that there is people who believes this stuff as you slowly turn into baffled that people actually believe this stuff. Fun movie if your smart, scary movie if you're not?"
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Fantastic Documentary,"Brave men and women speaking out about not only the injustices of the past 2.5 years but also the atrocities committed during HIV/AIDS epidemic, everyone should see this and share it far and wide, maybe it will make more people question the narratives that have destroyed so many peoples lives. I am amazed Anthony Fauci is still walking the streets after what he and his colleges have done over the years, its a massive wake up call for anyone who has been following the narrative over the past 2.5 years and will hopefully wake up the masses to the thousands who have been seriously injured and killed by some of these decisions, I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't want this documentary to get out and you can see that in some of the comments."
The Real Anthony Fauci (2022),Frightening,"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Is a fighter in the tradition of old style muckrakers. He worked tiredlessly to clean up the Hudson River in my home state of New York. He has successfully sued numerous polluting companies and has now turned his furt towards big pharma. With extensive interviews with real scientists such as Dr. Robert Malone, MD and Dr. Peter McCullough, MD, we are shown the deep corruption within the WHO and the incredible deception from studies withheld from the public as to the side effects from the vaccines. This is in no way a political film taking either side in the ongoing debate concerning our medical system. I highly recommend this great film. Bobby, JR is a national treasure."
Racing Extinction (2015),Extremely informative and eyeopening,"Racing Extinction is a powerful and informative documentary film that tackles the issue of mass extinction and the devastating impact that humans have on the environment. The film is both engaging and thought-provoking, using stunning visuals and compelling storytelling to raise awareness about the urgent need for conservation efforts. The story is both captivating and alarming, drawing attention to the fact that we are currently in the midst of a mass extinction event, the sixth in the history of the Earth. The documentary features several species that are on the brink of extinction, including the majestic manta ray and the elusive pangolin. The film also exposes the dark and illegal trade of endangered species, highlighting the efforts of activists and scientists to uncover and expose this illegal activity. The production of the film is phenomenal, with the script providing a well-structured and informative narrative that is easy to follow. The use of stunning cinematography and breathtaking shots of nature and wildlife provides an immersive experience for the audience. The lighting, colors and editing are all expertly done, creating a sense of urgency and drama throughout the film. The sound and music are also noteworthy, with a haunting and powerful soundtrack that complements the visuals and adds depth to the emotional impact of the film. The acting, costumes, makeup, and styling are not applicable in this type of documentary, as it features real-life people and events. Overall, Racing Extinction is a deeply moving and impactful documentary that shines a light on the urgent need for conservation efforts and the impact of human activity on the environment. The film is an important reminder of our responsibility to protect and preserve the natural world for future generations. It is a must-see for anyone who cares about the future of our planet and the species that call it home."
Racing Extinction (2015),"Eye opening, Heart touching, Stunning Document.","Very Very Good Documentary with great message. Me and my family and some friends are like it very much. I recommend to everyone to watch this beautiful document. But problem is that some criminals and criminal supporters are watch this. And definitely they're dislike and hate this as their character and personality. And they give low rating about this documentary. But no problem, we good people from around the world are definitely beat them and beat their evil thoughts, Mind and works...
Love and support this beautiful document......."
Racing Extinction (2015),"Propaganda, from ignorant, self-hating Humans","First off, I am NOT here to make any kind of statement or argument, I am reviewing a film. In doing so, I am justifying my 1/10 rating. Now, the film itself is well done and of high quality - except 90% of it is either lies or incorrect information, and for me, a documentary that is ANTI-FACTUAL is a crime against film and very nefarious and disrespectful to the viewers. Perhaps it's even dangerous. The purpose of a documentary is to bring facts and/or historical documentation in an educational, informational and enlightening fashion. In the case of this ''documentary'', it manipulates the trust that people have when watching a documentary, believing that they are being taught the facts. In some cases, there is fact in this film, but most of it is nonsense. There is in fact, a demographic of this world, about 2%, who actually hate the Human race, and believe that we all should die, even themselves. These people parade themselves around with a label most commonly known as 'Vegan'. These people, in their delusion, completely ignore the fact that 94% of all animal species on Earth eat other animals as part of - or all of their diet. They actually think that somehow Humans are evil and all other animals are gentle, cuddly little critters that should never be consumed as food. What a baffling ideology of contempt and sheer delusion. These people blame Humans for all the planet's issues, like the extinction of species and global warming, and predominately they blame anyone that eats meat. In this film they make many absurd claims. One is that there are 1+ billion cows on Earth being farmed. That is a lie. The real number is below 800 million. They claim that these cows release so much methane that they are causing global warming and mass extinction. This claim is laughable. Just a few hundred years ago, over 1.5 billion buffalo, wild horses, wild cattle, and other large animals roamed the land. Most of them consumed even more plants than today's cattle. A full grown American Bison releases 300% more methane than a domestic cow. Together this means that the total amount of methane being released was higher than it is today by a magnitude of 3 to 5. Even more ironic, is that the manure of livestock is used for fertilizer, which raises crop yield by 2 to 4 times over. Meaning the use of manure fertilizer reduces the amount of land needed, meaning what would normally take several acres to produce, can be produced in just 1 acre by using livestock manure. They also exclude the fact that a large portion of livestock - cows, goats, sheep, bison, etc, produce milk, which is packed full of nutrients and is used to make a wide variety of food. Chickens produce eggs as well, which account for a HUGE source of protein and nutrients. They also make the claim that the all the land being cut to make fields are used for growing food to feed livestock. This is completely ABSURD! 90% of land cleared for farming is used for foods that are staples of vegan and vegetarian diets - soy, oats, palm, sugar beets, sugar cane, and nuts, as well as corn used for biodiesel and ethanol to reduce the demand for oil. See, an animal like a cow is extremely important to feeding the world.... it turns wild or planted grasslands with virtually zero nutritional value to humans, into calorie dense, nutrient rich beef and milk. A Human can live an entire life of 90-100 years, and be very healthy and free of disease from eating only beef and milk, and use the manure to grow vegetables, grains and fruits, from just 1 cow every 5 years. If we stopped raising cattle, we would have to increase the amount of farmed land BY A FACTOR OF 10 TO 12, and then start to cope with a variety of illnesses and diseases that are now being found with vegetarians and vegans at alarming rates, 900% higher than a vegan diet after 20 years,
We would need 3 PLANET EARTH'S to support 7 billion vegans. There is far more nonsense in this film, but I chose only one topic to debunk. I would have to write a 3,000 page book to debunk all the claims made in this film. FACTS>FEELINGS!"
Racing Extinction (2015),Nice film,"Much needed look at the 6th mass extinction. Very sad at times, it should be a wake up call. We can do better."
Racing Extinction (2015),Eye opening film to change your perspective on the world,"The movie ""Racing Extinction,"" directed by Louie Psihoyos is a documentar/adventure about our planet reaching extinction. More specifically, they believe that we are entering our sixth major extinction event in history. An extinction event occurs when a large number of species die out in a relatively short period of time. A few past extinction events would be the end of the Triassic-Jurassic Period, and the end of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Period. This sixth extinction event would be classified as the end of the Anthropocene Era (Age of Man). This documentary brings a lot of good information to the table and opens up many questions for us as humans to answer. The main questions that came to me when watching this documentary were, ""who is to blame for this,"" ""do people even want to see change,"" and ""what would come about if things continue as normal. Not only does the film make you think about questions on your own, it presents you with a few questions as well. One of my biggest issues with this film though is the way it's presented to us. In society we are often blamed for all of the causes of climate change, extinction, and many other worldly problems. And that's just the issue, these are worldly problems, not single societal problems that have a simple solution to it. Also, this has been going on for a long time, the end of the last extinction event was 65 million years ago and that gave humans a very long time to rise and fall. The sad thing is that the ones that are most affected by it will have it the worst, and they weren't the cause of the problems. The film has many valid points but one thing I did not like was the focus on remote locations to blame for what is going on. They should not go on being able to do what they do, but we need to focus on the bigger picture and what we as a society can do. We need to stop blaming others first before we fix our own problems. The film mentions many other things that cause more species extinction than the selling of exotic animals on the blackmarket. Animal agriculture, habitat dead zones, and ocean dead zones are all the leading causes in species extinction, and while it was addressed in the film, it wasn't focused on nearly as much as it should have been. Killing these exotic animals is wrong, and it's sad that this is the only way for these people to make a living, but we need to take a lot of the focus the film had on that, and put it on the leading causes for extinction. When the blame is not on the leading causes, I feel as though it's an excuse to take the focus off of our own issues. Despite the shortcomings with this film, I believe it to have a very strong message, with the right factual information to back it up. It makes you care more about the planet and our species as a whole, and that is exactly what it was meant to do."
Racing Extinction (2015),Racing Extinction Movie Review,This is the best movie I've ever seen because it shows how much we see the nature of the planet. From what I see god created our beautiful world. Why would want to destroy it. It's something big that we can't get back. Nature is so pretty. It would suck if we all came out and the world looked all dark. It also showed us if we all cleaned up and didn't pollute there wouldn't be any pollution. Not to mention the saddest part of the movie was when the species were killed. It was so hard seeing those poor animals suffer.
Racing Extinction (2015),"An eyeopening film about our past, present, and future!","Racing Extinction is one documentary that will never quite leave your mind. This is probably because it deals with issues we see every day. Now when I use my car or go to the beach I'm going to think about how this is affecting the environment, my environment. Since I'm a very worried person this will most likely stay present in my mind for far longer than I'd like to admit but that's the point of documentaries like this. To change the way people think about their lives. Racing Extinction was an incredible documentary in the aspect that it did its job. ""65 million years ago, there was an asteroid that struck, and caused the dinosaurs to go extinct.. humanity has become the asteroid."" This was the first sentence that struck me. As children, we grow up around the stories of dinosaurs but we never knew the full extent of extinction. Extinction to its definition is the termination of a kind of organism or a group of kinds, usually a species. Extinction is when a whole species dies. Just let that sink in. A whole species, gone. Racing Extinction uses Blue Whales as an example of this at the beginning of the documentary. The pre-whaling population of this species was over 350,000. Now there are as few as 10,000 blue whales in existence. About 340,000 blue whales have been killed by humans. Whaling is an industry that started as early as the 11th century. This was when whales we killed and traded from country to country. This industry is one main reason why whales are so defunct. The documentary continues to a more controversial topic in the destruction of our environment; fossil fuels. I learned that the mass increase in carbon dioxide is a common factor in all 5 mass extinctions which is unsettling considering we produce carbon dioxide ourselves every time we breathe out. This means that just to survive we are slowly destroying our environment. But this documentary focuses mostly on oil companies. And although I agree this is an issue and it will continue to affect our environment poorly, they never talked about an alternative for this. I mean if we just got rid of all oil companies and pollution we would no longer be able to live our lives. The fact is we use fossil fuels way too much to just get rid of it. Watching the environmentalist travel all over the world and getting themselves into dangerous situations just to prove their point was very inspiring. I learned that just in this last decade, about over 800 environmental activists lost their lives to the cause. As this documentary expressed every life has a meaning and losing a life is so much more than simply one life. This documentary was an eye-opener to the horrific things happening around the world. Some of these things we can change but others are too important to change, in my opinion. I believe this documentary relates to two of the 7 revolutions which are population and resource management. With the increase in population comes the increase in carbon dioxide which we learned harms our environment greatly. While Resource Management is applied when talking about climate change in Alaska. Overall this documentary was an amazing watch. It introduced many topics that the media sometimes is reluctant to share. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the world we live in."
Racing Extinction (2015),It starts with one to make a change !,"This movie was very eye opening and educating to me. I would strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie no matter who you are. It gives you great insight on the massive problem we have regarding extinction and how our generation can save these endangered animals. Now, If you haven't watched this movie and you don't want spoiler alerts then do not continue to read after this point! However, If you have already watched this movie and want to continue learning about it just in case you missed something during the movie then continue to read my review. Also, If you haven't watched this movie yet but want to just read about it then you can also continue to read my review. This movie included many facts and clips of certain ocean species that are going extinct due to fishing for selling/trading and also the massive problem with carbon dioxide, oil, and methane. Some of the many species they showed and talked about were whales, sharks, manta rays, and plankton. People hunt whales to use for food, they use sharks and their fins for food, and they use rays for their gills because in China they use it by crushing them down to make glycerin sulfate pills. With plankton, 40% of it's productions has been lost in the last 50 years. The problem with this is, phytoplankton produces half of the air that we breathe! Just to put into perspective at how damaging humans are to this world, here are some facts to think about. There are five major extinctions in the entire history of the planet which have been the ordovician, late devonian, permian, triassic-jurassic, and the cretaceous tertiary. With that being said, sixty five million years ago a asteroid had killed all of the dinosaurs, but now humanity is the asteroid that is causing extinction now. Humanity is the main cause of this massive extinction problem, but just as we are the problem, there are also a ton of people trying to fix this issue. For example, 800 environmental activists have been killed just in the last decade which is crazy! What you also see a lot in the movie and also in the environmental activist community are photojournalist. Photojournalist's jobs are to document a time and a place that may not be there in the future which is extremely beneficial because it helps spread awareness around the globe which a lot of people have successfully done. During this movie, it shows a lot of the selling, trading, and fishing part of extinction, but what it also shows is the environmental side of it as well. Such as climate change, and what us human cause just by doing our daily tasks. Such as driving, using our air conditioners, and so much more. The movie explained some facts such as that 1/3 and 1/2 of carbon dioxide enters the ocean, also that if humans changed their diets to vegetarian then it would make a massive change as well. Throughout this entire movie, it shows how harmful humanity really is. Everyone around the world makes decisions that benefit them but don't think about how they are affecting and damaging the world for the long run. I encourage you to watch this movie and educate yourself as well as share with others about the huge problem we face today and our sad race to extinction."
Racing Extinction (2015),Everyone should recommend this documentary,"This documentary was outstanding. It had a lot of information that really captivates the main message that the documentary was trying to get across, that message being that we as people are destroying our own planet at an alarming rate. Whether that be by polluting our ocean or even the air we breathe, we have to figure out ways to stop the inevitable. Throughout the documentary, many examples were shown of how our society has been blind to its very own extinction. What I mean by this is that over the history of the Earth there have been five major extinctions. Starting with the Ordovician, the Late Devonian, the Permian, the Triassic-Jurassic, and the Cretaceous-tertiary Extinction. All of these extinctions were caused by a catastrophic event that couldn't have been prevented, however, we are now in the Anthropocene period or in other terms ¨the time of humans¨ and we are in the middle of destroying our planet every day. We as people are doing more harm every day more than when the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico happened. Another example that was shown in the documentary was that habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change are some of the main factors of extinction. All of these terms go hand in hand with one another because habitat destruction and fishing contribute to climate change. Climate is controlled by the ocean, but now the ocean is slowly changing due to the wildlife trade. It all starts with countries allowing the hunting of endangered species. I mean even the legal wildlife trade was so open about selling and trading endangered animals and at the time even the Obama administration was in agreement with the Japanese to start whale hunting again. Things like this cause so much harm to our planet and we somehow continue to struggle with this problem. These examples that the documentary shows aren't just problems across the world because restaurants in the United States sell endangered animals for us to eat as well. There are a bunch of animals being hunted into extinction such as sharks. The documentary showed how sharks have been on the Earth for a long time, even before the dinosaurs, and now that it is the time of the humans 250 sharks were being caught every single day bringing them closer to extinction. Regardless if they brought down the numbers of sharks that were being captured they are still being hunted for their fins and then being left to die just for soup. All in all, the documentary is a must-watch and it is very sad to see how we as people treat our planet and animals because at some point our future generations will not be able to witness or see the same things we had when we were around. All it takes is for one person to help spread the message and let others know, so we can do something to prevent our actions along with the inevitable that is yet to come."
Racing Extinction (2015),Really useful documentary that should be watched,We all know how we humans are responsible for the extinction of most of the species and this movie is about that. The film is actually an eye opener for us. These types of documentaries should come more and should be watched.
We Were Here (I) (2011),My Eyes...,I didn't know my eyes could produce this many tears. It's the most effective talking-heads documentary I've ever seen. Forget the cloying trash that they make today about the AIDS epidemic. This is the real deal.
We Were Here (I) (2011),A very powerful film,"This U.S. documentary chronicles the severe effect of AIDS on San Francisco 's gay community from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. The main structure of this film is interviews with four gay men and a lesbian who lived in San Francisco during the tumultuous period. One of the interviewees is HIV positive. All interviewees are very likeable and eloquent. There are moments of fighting back tears while recalling sad times. These moments were very genuine and did not seem manipulative by the filmmakers. The recollections begin in the 1970s when sexual liberation brought many gay people to San Francisco . It continues with the disease of AIDS when its causes were unknown, the onslaught of illnesses and deaths, the changes within the community along with the prejudices of the extreme right, and a new activism followed by drug cocktails that could prolong lives of those living with HIV. This documentary is blessed with great footage. There were several photographs and archived film footage of the past including those of the interviewees at much younger ages. This footage also included details of skin lesions and extreme thinness of AIDS patients before they died. A before-and-after image of a man who was vibrant and muscular before the disease is shocking as is a San Francisco magazine that listed several pages of photographs of those who died of AIDS in one particular year in the 1980s. The film is not all grim despite its content. The interviewees show lightness and humour when appropriate. While the occurrence of AIDS deaths has significantly decreased since the 1990s, this film is a solid reminder of a very dark period in recent history. The bad memories return quickly. - dbamateurcritic"
We Were Here (I) (2011),Moving testament to the resilience of the human spirit...,"Beautiful documentary gamely attempts to tread through the chaotic AIDS crisis of the 1980s using only a handful of survivors as commentators. Co-directors David Weissman and Bill Weber pull it off, however, and ""We Were Here"" is surprisingly absorbing and moving as a result. The celebration of sexual freedom for homosexual men in the 1970s ground to a halt at the end of the decade by what was initially being referred to on the street as the Gay Cancer. These wonderful men who survived to tell their individual, intimate stories are marvelous to listen to, painting a portrait of an era that was, by turns, frightening and challenging, yet one that brought out a number of true heroes. ***1/2 from ****"
We Were Here (I) (2011),na,"Kate Menz Riggs/Welte Humanities II 5 March 2016 We Were Here Review This documentary has powerful insight about LGBT rights and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is a very heart touching documentary of four gay men who lived and survived through the entire HIV/AIDS epidemic and are here now to share not only their stories, but all of their friends' and families' that died from this horrible, extravagant disease. In the 1970's, San Francisco was the place all gay men wanted to go. There were streets dedicated to them such as Castro Street and gay sex was highly encouraged, it was a place for gay people to really live, and these four men and directors, David Weissman and Bill Weber give a phenomenal look on what it was really like. When the ""disease that hit the gays"" hit San Francisco it hit hard. The four men will say ""people dropped like flies,"" and the depth and detail their stories provide people with a true visual of the catastrophe. One step at a time, the sense of community grows larger and larger in not only the gay people that were getting sick, but the thousands of volunteers spending their time to help them. This film gives you a real perspective of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and really how the LGBT community was affected by it. We Were Here will offer the true inside look on the AIDS epidemic."
We Were Here (I) (2011),"The power of words, images, people","As I listened to this small group of people talk about their experiences through the AIDS crisis in San Francisco, and I watched the images flow by, I was distraught, reflective, amused, angry, inspired and always in rapt attention. I moved to SF when I was 22 in 1984. I remember the B.A.R. obituaries. Seeing the sometimes shockingly short lifespans was sad, but you also read beautiful passages written by survivors to affirm and celebrate their friends' lives, and not just mourn their deaths. Spoiler Alert!  What I love about this movie is what's brought home by one of the narrators at the end: The title of the movie, ""We Were Here"", refers to all of us who were here during that time - the living and the dead, who are still missed."
We Were Here (I) (2011),'How to find meaning while battling an illness that confounds it',"The AIDS Epidemic first reached San Francisco and its vibrant gay community in the late 1970s. A mystery to doctors, both in form and how it was being transmitted, the disease that would come to be termed the 'gay plague' spread rapidly. By the start of the 1980s, men were rapidly presenting with symptoms of both Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia. With treatments having little effect, nothing could be done but to help them die. Weissman and Weber's 'We Were Here' is not an exploration of the impact of the AIDS epidemic per se, but of a chapter in American social history. Do not expect any reflection on the ongoing African epidemic for example, the focus is the effect on individuals and the community in San Francisco that went beyond that simply of illness and death. How does one retain moral strength when friends and loved ones are dying of an illness that is not only untreatable, but for a long time, simply unknown? In as much, the directors should be commended for finding a cast of people both so involved in the crisis, yet affected in such different ways by the devastation wrought. The inclusion of a lesbian nurse who worked in the city's first specific-AIDS ward and later helped organize a number of clinical trials is a notable touch given the hostility between the gay and lesbian communities at the time. The manner in which the epidemic brought the two communities together, with lesbians holding blood banks to exploit their immunity, is one of the film's most tender and poignant moments. Ultimately, what all the voices share are lives so deeply intertwined with the period that it is impossible not to get emotional listening to their recounting. Given the added context of the isolation and ostracision of the gay community during the period, one's admiration for the strength and perseverance shown by the men and women (one of whom is indeed HIV-positive) cannot be overstated. Do not fear a kitsch, overly-sentimental eulogy to those who died. 'We Were Here' is as much about life-affirmation as it is death. The many who died would be proud to see how their loved ones have managed to move on and enjoy fulfilling lives, without ever forgetting them. Concluding Thought: How to even begin to comprehend life as a homosexual in San Francisco at the time? The interviewees do their best to describe it, but I think even they know there are limits to what they can put across in words."
We Were Here (I) (2011),essential viewing,"This is a really fine piece of work. The BBC screened it on BBC4 in Febrary 2012 and made it available via i-Player also. Anyone who lived in the Bay Area during the eighties will be moved, informed and educated by this documentary. As a young gay geek in San Francisco in those years, I was overwhelmed by the deaths and suffering I saw and often could not make sense of it. This documentary really helps. The tales of the attacks on civil liberties by the bigots, and the personal tales were emotive and powerful.  Now I salute those survivors and hope their stories will stimulate others in future onslaughts."
We Were Here (I) (2011),Tragic but Excellent,"I was 18 years old when I went to Greenwich Village in 1985 to attend school at NYU. Before that, I had never been acquainted with the gay community and only knew closeted and frustrated gay people. My eyes were opened when I got there, in a wonderful way. But AIDS had beat me there and I remember the profound fear and controversy that was unfolding at the time. This movie made me think of those days like I hadn't for years. It is an incredible, moving story which shows how much of a Holocaust the epidemic was. It is heartbreaking and poignant, with personal stories and compassion shown by the individuals involved which are heroic and inspiring. I found this movie to be an important contribution to a period of American History that musn't be forgotten. I found myself shocked all over again by how widespread and devastating the epidemic was, how it was ignored and feared by a homophobic nation. I wonder how different our world might be today if we hadn't lost so many wonderful, creative young people to this plague? AIDS survival has come a long way, but the disease is not gone. People really should rent this movie, it's like lighting a memorial candle of sorts. You will remember someone who is gone that touched your life in a special way."
We Were Here (I) (2011),"Insightful documentary about the first years of AIDS, and how it affected people","I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. At the time of this story (the 80's) the AIDS epidemic was something we read about in newspapers and magazines, at a safe distance so to speak. What I remember most was the long time it took before the underlying causes became clear. There were several theories at first, because no one could find a common denominator for two target groups that suffered most: hard drugs addicts and homosexuals. Nowadays, it is easy for us to see the connection as being obvious. What we easily overlooked at that time was the impact it had on people that were hit, in combination with the hopelessness of their situation in the absence of a cure. Two quotes I can't wipe from my mind: [1] ""Can't go on like this"" at a moment that many friends and acquaintances died, without any effective remedy in sight. And quote [2] ""Don't want to come out of this war like my father came out of the war he fought in"", as if wondering how the world would be after this bad interval was over, and whether residual trauma's were to be expected. Not only quotes like these, but also the honest stories told by survivors that were interviewed, certainly left an impression on us. All in all, I could do nothing more than giving the maximum score (5 out of 5) for the audience award when leaving the theater. We saw a very comprehensive overview of how people (re)acted on the disease, presented by all sorts of people involved. It also makes us think about possible new diseases that may befall on us. For example bird flu (H5N1) springs to mind, due to a recent publication about related work in Rotterdam (NL). While imagining that such a virus breaks loose, either this one or a new one for that matter, it is difficult to suppress post-apocalyptic visions about what may happen."
We Were Here (I) (2011),I was there,"I went to see ""We Were Here"" today at the Cinéma-Village theater in New York. I was afraid it would disappear before I got the chance to see it. This movie was recommended by a friend who is a producer at KQED in San Francisco as being the ultimate resource on San Francisco during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. Along with Randy Shilts's seminal book, ""And the Band Played on,"" he was certainly right. One great element of ""We Were Here"" is that it gives several quite different perspectives on what the HIV epidemic in San Francisco was like at that time: Ed, the misfit who found his place in the gay community by volunteering with people with AIDS early in the epidemic; Daniel, the Jewish artist who felt he had found his true family among San Francisco's gay men and then lost them all within a few painful years; Paul, the high-profile political activist; Guy, the big-hearted, philosophical black flower vendor; and Eileen, the lesbian nurse who served at ground zero of the epidemic and stuck with it with grit and compassion to the end. Like Ed, I didn't fit in well in the ""gay community"" during my years in San Francisco. So disconnected was I that I did not know a lot of what was happening in the early and mid-1980s, although I remember Guy the florist, who always had a smile for every passerby on the street corner where he worked, and I remember James Harning, a beautiful young man who died a hard death in 1992. ""We Were Here"" helped me understand much of what was going on all around me in those days. It will do the same for others who weren't ""there,"" for reasons of either age or geography, and it will be a moving, bittersweet reminder for those who did survive those difficult years in San Francisco."
The True Cost (2015),Well-made documentary about the clothing industry.,My Rating : 7/10 If you've ever wondered what 'sweatshops' mean then 'The True Cost' will truly give you the inner details of the industry which makes the world's garments along with the sad reality of the workers. Must-see for consumers and eye-opening for sure!
The True Cost (2015),Definitely worth a watch.,"""The True Cost"" is a documentary that has definitely left an impact on my views on the world of fast fashion. The director, Andrew Morgan and producer, Michael Ross bring light to the devastation and inhumane practices that are a result of our selfish shopping practices. The documentary follows a mother who is a garment worker, and her son who are both located in Bangladesh, as she takes us through her everday life and uncovers the terrible working conditions she endures everyday in hopes that her son will some day live in better conditions than what they currently were in. It later covers the Rana Plaza disaster that left over thousands dead and included actual footage from the day of the disaster. I appreciated the raw footage that was included because it showed the severity of the disaster and how many lives were lost because of the irresponsible and unsafe conditions of that factory. After seeing the terrible conditions that these workers endure, I find it hard to go back to shopping with fast fashion brands without feeling extremely guilty. It's hard to justify supporting modern capitalism when others who are less fortunate are doing worse off for our benefit. Not only does the documentary cover the conditions of working in a sweat shop, but Morgan and Ross also make sure to take account of the environmental repercussions that we as a society will endure as a result of fast fashion. The water ways we are polluting, the pesticides and chemicals that we are emitting into our air ways, the piles of clothing landfill we are creating, it's hard to not want to implement change into your lifestyle and everyday being after watching this documentary. Learning about how pesticides and the cotton industry is also contributing to world wide pollution, especially when cotton is deemed as an ""organic"" and ""clean"" resource was so eye opening. It is so surprising to learn that many things deemed good and safe for our environment are actually harming our ecosystems and water ways. It was very disheartening and almost angering learning about how such well known brands and companies are completely taking advantage of people in third world and developing countries who desperately need a job. It made me feel so differently towards big name companies that claim to be treating their workers ethically and humane, when in reality they're not. Overall I really appreciate how this movie is not shoving a certain lifestyle in your face, begging you to change your ways and telling you how terrible of a person you are for buying retail. It does a great job at sharing these workers' stories and amplifying their voices, while also visiting locations closer to home and explaining how we ourselves can make a difference. I learned a lot about consumerism and how more recent generations have turned shopping into a hobby rather than going out of necessity. This documentar has definitely opened my eyes and has made it very difficult to go back to the hyper-consumerism I was used to taking part of."
The True Cost (2015),Compulsory Consumption,"I live in Turkey and there are many ""cheap"" textile factory in terms of their work conditions and quality of their products. People buy more items than they actually need and this behaviour causes textile industry growing day by day. 
Any kind of shoe production costs approximately 2$ - 5$ dollars,
Any kind of t-shirt, sweater, shirt costs 1$ - 3$ dollars,
Any kind of hat, sock, belt costs 0 - 1$ dollars, 
Nike, Adidas, H&M, Zara, Pull & Bear, 21 Forever, Gucci, Berschka ect. doesn't matter where you buy your clothes, they are all produced very cheap and sold for five times more expensive than they worth. 
Why do you pay extra money for famous brand logo? 
Being minimalist is similar to being vegan & vegetarian and it means sacrificing luxury for the long term benefit."
The True Cost (2015),Must Watch -,"This documentary clear shows the exploitative methods used by Big companies and owners and how the slavery has been outsourced to 3rd world countries. This documentary also invokes the responsibility of an average citizen towards our environment. Being a citizen of a 3rd world country like India, i completely understand the situation of the workers in india and the neighboring countries and how our people are being exploited in every industry. One thing we need to understand is our role in the society. Everyone's role is being reduced to a role of ""consumer"". Think about it. Don't worry about the Metascore and Critics reviews. They don't understand how important this film is."
The True Cost (2015),Makes you think about your choices,"Great documentary about the real price we pay (people and the planet) for fashion and overbuying clothing. At times it seemed that it was repeating and dragging, but overall worth the time. I can no longer justify my clothing donations to charity."
The True Cost (2015),The true cost: human progress,"A primitivist stance in which the losers of their markets (film production, fashion, journalism) gang against what they call ""big business"". Meaning the workers in poor countries would be far better crouched in the rice paddy under the Sun, than having a wage. Yet somehow, the entitlements on which the Western losers live are NOT to be sent to the poor workers. This is yet another refined argument for protectionism and closed borders."
The True Cost (2015),PLEASE WATCH THIS FOR RAISING QUESTIONS... AND THEN FIND ANSWERS YOURSELF...,"I have seen many documentaries, but when it comes to human exploitation this is by far the most question arising docu i have ever seen. what is development? social justice? basic humanity? when companies in order to reduce their cost prices and increase profits employ destitute people who doesn't have any alternate career other than being a laborer for a meager salary in sweatshops, and supporting their act by claiming that they are providing livelihood to these wretched lives as if they were not living before these companies came. what do you call it if not social exploitation? The words spoken by the environmental activist are cent percent true. Fertilizers and seed business in an epidemic in INDIA that is not there before the 1950s. They affected the generations of Punjab region both medically and economically. Many might think this docu to be an anti-capitalistic propaganda. But developing capitalistic economies at the cost of what? companies might not feel empathy with argument, but a consumer should feel it before falling in the craze of ""Brands"". They have to remember those hands that suffered for producing the clothing that you're buying at ""discounted"" prices and festive sales. The least as an audience should you do is give this a higher rating so that the problem is addressed and more people become aware of what ""REAL SLAVERY"" would look like in the modern world."
The True Cost (2015),Everyone should see this.,"I've seen people complaining about being a propaganda, anti capitalism documentary. And because of that you rate the documentary low? Shouldnt' you be worried about the main message of the documentary? Rate it low and people won't see this. So we won't change and everything stays the same. You could at least put your ideologies aside and help spread the worth about this problem."
The True Cost (2015),Truth mixed with Ideology and Propaganda,"I gave it a five since it exposes the true ugly and dark underside of the clothing industry. With all but the very high end clothing produced offshore in the West, a massive industry of unregulated, nonunion dangerous sweatshops in the lowest labor cost nations produces most of our clothing. Think of that next time you buy a 100 dollar shirt and see that it was made in Vietnam probably for about $2.00 cost. However the movie takes a hard left turn in the second half. They have the requisite video segment from a Fox News talking-head about sweatshops and how they might really serve a purpose. Then they interview Marxist economic Richard Wolf who blames the problem on not on idiot consumers or corrupt governments in producer nations, but on capitalism and calls for a new system. What new system? Socialism of course. Every useful idiot academic these days is in love with socialism. Capitalism is not the problem. It is brain dead materialistic consumers who turned shopping from necessity into a weekly hobby and became addicted to cheap overseas products. Generations X and Y who consume like fools. Look at the ages of those waiting in line on Black Friday and in front of an Apple Store when Tim Cook announces the newest $1200 iPhone. These are all younger Americans charging in to buy the products of sweatshops. Change their minds and you solve a great part of the problem. The other issue not addressed is the fault of the governments of the producer nations. No unions, labor laws, decent wages or environmental controls. The movie implies that these governments has no power against these corporations. Sure they do. This was the situation in the US 100+ years ago and we solved it. But somehow the third world is not at fault. In this film. The Western capitalists are at fault in the logic of the producers and writers. Worth watching with a critical eye."
The True Cost (2015),Passionate and compassionate account of fast fashion's social and environmental impacts,"The True Cost documents filmmaker Andrew Morgan's efforts to understand the world of fast fashion (with it's ""fifty two seasons a year"" marked by $5 shirts and $20 pairs of jeans), a world that's only existed for a few decades and has had enormous impacts on people's lives in both high- and low-income economies. It's a well-traveled and wide-ranging film, sometimes so much so that you get a bit lost for it's jumping from one place to another. But the economic systems that connect garment workers in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia to North American, European, and Asian consumers are complicated, often intentionally obscure, and they affect people and ecosystems all over the globe, so the film's wide angle view makes sense. To covers so much means that the film sometimes jumps quickly from topic to topic, without digging very deeply into any one issue for long (towards the end of the film, for example, its critique of consumerist / materialist capitalism follows logically from all we've seen, but the discussion can't do justice to the complexity of the questions posed). But for a documentary meant to introduce the topic, that's a reasonable directorial choice to make. Beautifully filmed, with passionate, informed, and compassionate interviewees, The True Cost is worth watching."
Santa Camp (2022),Santa's that make it about themselves instead of the magic of Santa,"This was an interesting documentary, I liked the perspectives. I don't care if Santa is trans or non traditional, just don't make it about you. Your take on Santa should still be rooted in the magic of Santa for the kids, not showcasing your personal life. The documentary had an agenda vs showing more of a wholistic view of this Santa camp. It was well done and engaging, but the overall self involved nature of the individuals and tilt earned this a 2. When I head out with my kids to see Santa, I don't care what Santa's personal life is, just looking for a fun picture keepsake and the magic of Santa and Christmas."
Santa Camp (2022),Wow. SO Good!,"Wow, this surprised the hell out of me. One of my favorite modern Christmas movies is a documentary titled, ""Becoming Santa,"" which follows one man who decides to go to Santa training school and be a ""mall Santa"" for the first time (except he goes to just about everywhere except a mall). This one is sort of like a modern sequel, focusing on the lack of diversity with mall Santas and how the Old School Santas feel about it (some are open and some are not). It's a tear-jerker if you can empathize with what some of these newbies have to put up with. Too many people in our country want to live and die in the past, it's pretty pathetic. In the end, the message is a positive one and I highly recommend it for everyone who loves Christmas and has an open mind (and I also recommend it to those who don't, actually)."
Santa Camp (2022),Santas for All.,"A good balance of the unsettling awfulness of bigotry, and the magical excitement of what Santa truly represents. The the smiles of children and adults is a sturdy backdrop that makes small the hate and apprehension shown to these brave Santas, and by one bad santa. It really is a love triumphs over hate movie, that has a light touch where it needs to and does not skimp on all things festive. I was impressed with how honestly the movie showed how people learn to accept, exercise that acceptance to make it stronger, and how even if things make you feel uncomfortable at first, you realize it is simply because it is something you are not used to. Trans Santa meeting non binary kids brought tears. These children feeling free and open with their Santa broke a tension in me that I didn't know I needed breaking. Kid friendly (though it might lose their interest) and very intriguing to adults. A soulful and hopeful doc. Happy holidays to all and to all a good watch!"
Santa Camp (2022),There's a new Santa in town!,"The importance of this movie and this community can not be stated enough. I was truly touched by the bravery in these people, and the impact they have on others. I was also disgusted by phobic and racist people claiming to be sent by God, and that the Holy Spirit spoke through them and chanting that they were saving Santa. News flash guys- Santa isn't even in the Bible and Christmas is not about hatred. I want to say so much more about this amazing documentary and the amazing people it evolves around, but that would spoil too much, so please watch it and experience the true Christmas spirit."
Santa Camp (2022),A Magical Exploration of Being a Better Santa,"I highly recommend this documentary. It's an easy to watch heartfelt tale of Santa's working towards becoming better Santa's by helping a new generation of Santa's and imparting their ever growing book of Christmas cheer. Although not every Santa has learned how to cope with their white haired, white beard, white faced image of Santa, this rag tag band of Christmas misfits seeks out new diverse members to join ""The Brothers in Red."" While this documentary often times felt too literal and somewhat forced in its exploration of current social themes, it managed to bring it together in the end and the result is a beautiful exploration of what it means to be Santa in todays society."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Caution: Baby Witches At Play,"What did I watch? Women who are hitting middle age acting like high school girls as they discover witchcraft. So where do they go for training and ghost hunting? Why, the biggest tourist attraction in the world! Salem, MA! And they spend an entire week training! Any pagan went through the baby witch phase, but most a good bit younger than Vanessa and GG. But they seem to not be more evolved than teenagers. Ladies, if you can't follow the directions to bake Toll House cookies, your would be really amusing to watch trying to cast spells. Learn to follow a recipe first. Yes, this is a disaster. The viewer gets no information about paganism, or even about ghost hunting. There is no rational side offered either. Oh, voices in the basement of a liquor store? Is there a basement of another building adjacent to the store, with voices carrying through the pipes? Hearing people on the street, or upstairs? Nah, it has to be ghosts. It is amusing to watch these two scare themselves, so they should have just gone with that angle. Instead, we get style over any modicum of substance."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Disappointing,"It's more about looking cute in goth attire than showing respect to spirits of any kind. High school slumber party where they hold fake seances and light as a feather stiff as a board comes to mind. The young women are lovely and engaging, but perhaps they watched The Craft one too many times. The history of the place and tours of the old buildings were informative and interesting, and the viewer is introduced to people genuinely involved in the study of spiritual matters like communication with the dead and witchcraft. And, as has become the norm in paranormal shows, they forget that those who died as a result of the Salem trials were not practicing witches."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Lacking in every sense,"Why does a movie like this exist? It has no director and no writer, i.e. There literally is no script, meaning they just randomly chose what to film and then edited it together. Any other persons appearing are not even credited, they seem to be either locals or personal acquaintances of the two actresses, who literally play themselves for crying out loud. Apart from absolutely nothing significant happening, there's neither a dramatic arch or character development. And of course there isn't - there is no script! The base message of ""be yourself"" is so forced in through overlay monologues that it loses all meaning. Any franchise tie-in with the sole purpose of keeping up the license has more substance and, most of all, reason to be made in the first place. It just feels like Hudgens and Magree were bored, so they made a movie, expenses paid by the producers. This feels like some random, very subpar Youtube documentary about two teens with the paranormal as a hobby, it's full of either bland or forcefully polemic babble and all in all has nothing redeeming whatsoever."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Unbearably awful.,"I didn't expect a scholarly exploration of The Salem Witch Trials, but I expected what little bit that was referenced to be accurate. It was not even close. They didn't even mention that there were men who were also victims in Salem. I didn't expect a deep dive into the various paths of witchcraft, but I thought there might be some information that some might find useful. This giggly, inebriated, over-accessorized attempt by two vapid fluffy-bunnies to find ... something ... was painful to watch, disrespectful to the victims of the Salem Witch Trials, had more in common with GHOSTBUSTERS than anything to do with real witchcraft, and I found myself hoping some evil spirits would scare some sense into these two."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),The single stupidest thing I've ever seen,"Absolute total stupidity...nearly unspeakably stupid. This is what 2 obnoxious attention seeking adolescents become when no one sufficiently shuts them the FU or puts them away for treatment resistant borderline personally disorder. This entire ""film"" is just...I mean it would be comedic if they weren't actually taking themselves seriously. The interjection of catch ""spiritual "" language ups the viewers nausea as the ""girls"" then attempt to identify as both victims and spiritual trailblazers. The Wiccan/Craft/Pagan communities are terribly reflected here, leaving the viewer with the sense that these traditions are accurately represented by these giggling morons."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),She's 35,"The entire time I watched this movie, I assumed Hudgens was in her late teens or that the movie came out 15 years ago. The more I watched her disturbingly childish behavior, and the more I started to put together in my mind the fact that it's been decades since those High School Musical movies came out, the more I realized that I was watching a 35 year old woman with the demeanor of a 13 year old child. That is the really scary thing about this movie, not the ghost hunting part. I have friends her age who have teenage children in junior high who behave more maturely than her. At one point in the movie she complains how people only acknowledge her role in HSM. Perhaps if she grew up and acted like an adult she might get cast as an adult in something."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Void of ANYTHING pertinent or informative,"This ""movie"" documents the journey Vanessa Hudgens and GG Magree undertake to discover true witchcraft and enter the spirit world. Yeah, right. Whilst wearing negligees and appearing always slightly intoxicated, they giggle and prance around Salem. It's a ridiculous farce. Then, Vanessa gets to the ""serious"" part where she reads from a journal about her growth and discoveries with braid extensions and lots of candles. Again, yeah right. It's laughable and cringy. You'll learn nothing. It's these two blathering idiots discussing the women tried as witches ...and female empowerment. It's shockingly distespectful to those women who suffered and died. There is no way anyone could possibly sit through it all the way through. I did it for you. Save yourselves...choose ANYTHING else."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),so insignificant it can't even be described as fluff - 1/10,"Imagine two grown women who have the combined IQ of a single schoolgirl. Imagine a string of failed relationships. Imagine an unhealthy interest in wicca and witchcraft because it's a safe-space and its somehow cool to tap into potentially malevolent forces. Take these ingredients and send Vanessa Hudgens and Georgia Magree down to Salem to do some ghost-hunting. Add in various colorful Salem residents, let the pot boil for 98 (long) minutes and watch these two gullible characters become reborn and reinvigorated thanks to the accommodating business-people of Salem (who in no way profited with Ouija Board tuitions, book sales, wine sales, spiritual guidance, etc). Watch two grown women bake cookies and over-share about how broken they are whilst dressing like they're 16. It's a truly inspiring tale that grinds The Patriarchy into the dirt and cannot be described as self-publicizing fluff for a Z-list actress and an obscure Australian-DJ. Look out for the sequel next year where they set up a coven in LA where hi-jinks are aplenty. If there's no Oscar nod next year for this masterpiece, I'm going to demand answers."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),STUPID,"This is sooooooo dumb and my question is why? Vanessa huges shame on you - why? I just saw this and thought to myself - is she become irrelevant to firce her to do this? Oh my goodness WHAT A DUMB WASTE OF TIME! I like VH
No more
Shame on you to show your true colors and just become dumb. This is sooooooo dumb and my question is why? Vanessa huges shame on you - why? I just saw this and thought to myself - is she become irrelevant to firce her to do this? Oh my goodness WHAT A DUMB WASTE OF TIME! I like VH

Shame on you to show your true colors and just become dumb - urgh Hollywood trasg."
Dead Hot: Season of the Witch (2023),Dead Not? Hot Mess? Take Your Pick,"This ""reality"" show fiasco is exactly what one would expect from a show runner, a camera operator, and a bunch of other TV errand boys & girls whose previous gigs were the Lizzo show, Haunted Highway & Keeping up with the Ks. There is nothing hot here. Both girls slather on two pounds of pancake foundation (and not enough powder) & slip into Demonia vinyl platform boots to tell us about their personal journey into witchiness. They throw in some terribly bad acting, fake ghost detections, a hoaky graveyard set (Peter Killer, really?) & an embarrassingly naïve revisionist take on the Salem Witch trials, which are blamed on the Patriarchy, despite the original accusers being young girls. Judging from the sleep-over style presentation, young girls aged 10-11 years old are indeed the obvious target audience here, despite both Hudgens & Magree being close to 35 years old. All of these factors result in a femdom empowerment roadtrip to Snoresville. Save your 90 minutes & watch The Craft instead."
4K Fireplace (2015),Immersive,"""I can almost feel the heat coming off that thing"" - first words out of my mouth after about 10 minutes. The snaps and crackles are captured with surprising alacrity. The conflagration is nothing short of actual steadfast unflinching realism. It watches like 'found film' but inexplicably because the viewer finds oneself in the perspective that an omniscient being would assign a finite viewer. Understated brilliance in the old stone setting with ironwork grate. My only criticism is in the lighting which is aspirational in its muted technique, but for that same reason this is where one sees the artist's hand and thereby a hint of the artifice behind the art. Or perhaps that element is intentional, in which case the medium may transcend the content."
Morning of the Earth (1972),A significant Australian cultural artifact with a universal message about what it means to be truly alive and free.,"This work of art has not aged at all, if anything after fifty years its message has become even more important as we pass through a time of overbearing government and interference in our lives. The film depicts a very Australian appreciation for freedom and direct communion with the universe. There is a particularly Zen flow to it as the footage capture surfers in ""the now"" during their pilgrimages to ride great waves. It is simultaneously so very down to earth and unsophisticated yet it still stands as a spiritual statement as profound as any mysterious gnostic text. The images are paired with a soundtrack that points out the message for you, just in case you didn't just tune in and ""get it"" directly. May we return to those halcyon days, and never allow them to be taken from us again."
Morning of the Earth (1972),An Absolute Must-See Classic,"Transcends its genre. Shot on gorgeous 16mm film, this is a one-of-a-kind meditation on the beauty of the earth through the lens of surfing. Looking back from 2010 with the industry's obsession with sponsorships, competitions and tricks, this film now seems a powerful echo from a different era. All the corruptive layers fall away and the viewer is invited into the mesmerizing spectacle of humans balanced on the edge of powerful oceanic forces in between living simply in the woods and building their own surfboards. The soulful original soundtrack is the icing on the cake, and reinforces the notion of surfing as no mere sport, but rather an art, a dance, and an attitude towards life."
Morning of the Earth (1972),"""Seeing everything as nothing but the soul...""","I was surprised to see that one Australian online DVD store had this movie categorised under 'Sport'. Certainly 'Morning of the Earth' is a surfing movie, showing footage of many famous 70s surfers going through their paces, but it is also much more than that... 'Morning of the Earth' is a beautiful and artistic movie about the counter-culture of the late 60s and early 70s, which took the form of an alternate lifestyle of simplicity and self-sufficiency in the warm tropics of Australia, Bali, and Hawaii... 'a fantasy of surfers living in three unspoilt lands and playing in nature's oceans', the booklet enclosed with the DVD says... and it goes on to say... 'see everything as nothing but the soul and the soul in everything you see'. ""Morning of the Earth' has no dialogue and there is an excellent soundtrack of Australian music from the early 70s, featuring artists such as Brian Cadd, G. Wayne Thomas, and Taman Shud. One of the classic songs is 'Open up your Heart'... which says... 'It's a start, when you open up your heart, give your love to others, they become your brothers, when you open up your heart'. The surfing footage in 'Morning of the Earth' is stunning, full of mesmerizing blues, greens, yellows, and reds; including sunsets and sunrises. But as I say this is a movie that is about much more than surfing. Get the picture?"
Morning of the Earth (1972),Brilliant Surf Movie,"Wonderful pictures of surfers in Australia, Indonesia and Hawaii. The cuts are not very fast like the today most used MTV-style but slow. The feeling of this movie is really psychedelic. Some pictures showing the surfers outside the water, but not too much of it. Most of the movie shows surfin' and that's what we buy surf movies for. Best surf movie I have ever seen."
Morning of the Earth (1972),"fantastic, worthy of multiple standing ovations","as cliche as it may sound, words cannot describe the beauty in which morning of the earth embodies. it is a story without words, of a group of surfers walking away from it all to live a rich and fullfilling life, surfing, growing crops, building surfboards, and smoking grass... morning of the earth was made during what is generally regarded as hostile time. vietnam was in full swing and many a young man feared being drafted into the military. albie falzon has reminded us that the earth is good, but all in all you have to make it on your own. just like the song says. highlights of the film include, michael peterson getting barreled off his nut at kirra (before the high rises, and only a few other blokes out), whoever the guy is in jean shorts ripping it up at angourie after he builds his own board, and the scene where the two aussies get the indonesian men stoned as. a tru classic."
Morning of the Earth (1972),visual/tone poem to the surfer lifestyle,"This film depicts, in a languorous mood, the special connection surfers and other performance artists have with nature. The overall feel of the movie is mellow and mesmerizing, with long shots of wafer-thin wave faces and hypnotic tube rides. An absolute blast, this is for everyone who has ever ridden a wave or simply wished they had."
The Kardashians: Reality Royalty (2020),They call themselves reality royalty be they really are running the world,"This show is such good tv. These girls really are running the reality business, shaping fashion and beauty, as well as social media culture. To say these girls work hard is an understatement. They all run very successful business and have capitalised very cleverly on every opportunity ever given to them. I'm not saying they weren't given a head start in life, but so were many other people and you don't see them turning it into a multi billion dollar empire. So excited to see what they are up to, how their businesses are going and what their next move will be."
The Kardashians: Reality Royalty (2020),If only there was some way to give this a MINUS 10.,They are just as fake as their plastic implants. Don't waste your time. As for their plastics implants I have to laugh at how they all claim not to have had surgery. Lol.
"My Mum, Your Dad UK (2023)",Not wonderful,"Entertaining in the broadest least critical sense. An attempt to cram meeting , courtship and progression into a two week isolated jaunt is a predictable sequence and result. Inevitably you will get nice people and awful people in the mix as they interact. You will also get people who will automatically hit it off in there or in the queue at the supermarket deli. The ""experts"" brought in for the sessions were at times cheesy and cringe worthy with the overall situation messing with peoples minds whilst the ones who would have hit it off anywhere sail on oblivious. The only reason I've awarded 2 instead of 1 is the full time ""expert panel"" who kept watch over them. That was inspired. I won't be bothering with any of series 2 when it arrives, even if it's the only alternative to watching paint dry."

Dark Web: Mystery Box (2020),Highly enjoyable and chilling quarantine anthology,"A series of random vignettes about people who receive mystery boxes from the dark web which turns deadly for all involved. There was a lot to like here. The random zipping around to the various performers which happen in the midst of their introductory segments offers plenty of fun segments here where it opens a fun style without getting bored with the segments. Opening on the couple who get murdered while watching internet videos gets this going nicely and then turning into the segments about the film collector and the spiritualist gives a great introduction. The film really gets going with the in boxing couple, where the continuous discoveries they make about the strange box and its contents shout out a bad idea and not going further. Their pressing on to discover the potential inherit of the box has a creepy air about it which is nicely enhanced by the follow-up video of the user offering to showcase safety and security measures for these kinds of videos which is a fantastic transition. That this one quickly becomes s obvious about the dangerousness of the VHS tape they receive turns this one up further. As each recipient receives the tape in various methods and packages with the common trope of satanic objects and trinkets, there's a rowing intensity to the segments shifting around to the various personalities removing the contents and getting unnerved about finding the tape. Once it shows them reacting to the tape, the chilling images serve this one well. The intensity level carries on with the final reactions and outcomes featured here. Bolstered by the genuinely creepy images shown in brief flashes, their physical and verbal breakdowns from where this one started build up from each individual shown. The editing style is a little weird here where it tends to favor some more than others at select points so some performers disappear for long stretches while some have stacked sections with several parts close together, but that's not a detriment here. Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language."
Dark Web: Mystery Box (2020),Great film,I thought this was a good original idea for the Quarantine. Due to the fact no one can really work on/finish their indie projects due to lockdown. The acting was spot on. Not to mention amazing cast. My favorite segment was Dane and the Druggy Bunny.
Star Trek: Picard: The IMAX Live Series Finale Event (2023),Paramont+ is so bad that they bundle their service with Pluto which is reruns from the 1950s and with Showtime another defunct app that is going nowhere!,"This subscription service, which launched in March 2021, blends a premium on-demand content library with live TV elements from CBS. And if it looks familiar to you, that's because it is a revamped and rebranded version of the now-defunct CBS All Access streaming platform. It's going for five dollars a month and I don't suggest you waste the five dollars that's how bad it is. For this review, I downloaded the app on my personal devices and subscribed to the service to find answers. The Paramont app is so bad it drove T-Mobile and to downsizing and laying off staff. Select T-Mobile customers may not want to buy services due to poor reviews. Active students are eligible for a 25% discount on your subscription plan of choice. But be prepared: I clicked through to check in on this option and found that Paramount Global will verify that you're actually a student before granting the discount.

Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes (2018),Extraordinary documentary based on Ali and Cavett's friendship,"This documentary pulls from more than a dozen of Muhammad Ali's appearances on the Emmy winning Dick Cavett Show between 1968 and 1979. At one time, Dick Cavett said Ali was his best friend; their affinity barrels through the screen. Cavett's respectful, sophisticated, witty and honest conversations about life, race, religion, and political injustice with Ali highlight the goodheartedness and intelligence of his guest. Ali's entertaining boosting and light and serious poetry give us a glimpse of the remarkable conscientious objector who embodied his moral code. ""There are probably no great compliments that I can pay my next guest that he hasn't already paid himself but I happily join him and millions of others. He is without a doubt one of the greatest sports figures the world has ever known. Just in case he can hear me, he is the greatest sports figure-charming, good looking and a heck of a nice guy."" Dick Cavett introducing Ali. ""They seemed to go to the edge of the racial debate in this country,"" recalls Reverend Al Sharpton of the interviews. Extraordinary footage of Ali in and out of the ring, having sleepovers with Dick Cavett, and speaking at events, gives a powerful snapshot of his life. Ali, said by some to be a mouthpiece for the Nation of Islam, challenged the U.S. government's attempt to draft him. In June 1967, Ali was convicted of violating the Selective Service Act and was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $100,000 for objecting to fighting in the Vietnam War. ""I ain't got nothing against them Vietcong."" ~ Muhammad Ali After he won his gold medal, Ali went to a diner in his hometown and was denied service. After that, he spoke up potently, insistently, and often poetically for civil rights. Ali told Cavett how much Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X meant to him. Cavett, concerned about the government claims against him for objecting to be drafted, asked if Ali was ready to go prison; he was. President Johnson's three member Presidential Draft Board ruled Ali's objection to be invalid and that he was not entitled to conscientious objector status as a minister of the Islamic religion. In April 1966 Ali wrote his local draft board protesting that two years of military service would cause him serious financial loss in being unable to pursue his livelihood as a boxer. He was stripped of his boxing license by the State of New York and title by the World Boxing Association when he converted to Islam. The World Boxing Council, however, recognized him as champ throughout his battle with the Government. When, trembling from Parkinson's disease, he carried the Olympic torch at the 1996 games in Atlanta, Ali, a legend, represented strength in hard times and a beacon of light who stood for his convictions of freedom and equality. ""But I think it almost had nothing to do with boxing. It had to do with him. He was this beautiful, charismatic, dynamic person who could've done anything."" Cavett on Ali Cassius Clay, who took boxing lessons after a bully stole his bicycle as a kid, was 29 and 0 when they took his title away. Nobody ever hit him or knocked him down. When he came back after over three years away in his prime, his fight with Joe Frazier was dubbed ""The Fight of the Century."" Frazier won in fifteen rounds. Ali ended his career being 56 - 5, but still the greatest. Some quotes by Ali ~ ""You can't hit what you can't see; I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!"" ""The hype was part of my job, like skipping rope."" ""Cassius Clay is a slave name. I didn't choose it, and I didn't want it. I am Muhammad Ali, a free name, and I insist people using it when speaking to me and of me."" Mohammad Ali received the Otto Yamaoka peace medal for his ""life-long engagement in the American civil rights movement and the global cultural emancipation of blacks, as well as his work as a UN Goodwill ambassador."" Well deserved. I already respected Muhammad Ali, but came away from this film with the highest admiration of the man. I highly recommend this movie."
Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes (2018),Needed More Focus And Less Re-Hashing,"When focusing on a documentary subject like Muhammad Ali, who has been picked apart by storytellers and journalists almost ad nauseam and will continue to be until the end of time, it is easy to fall into the trap of re-hashing all the classic stories and losing focus on the uniqueness of the concept that may have prompted the new doc on him. While ""Ali & Cavett"" isn't bad by any means, it does spring that trap far too much to be considered ""great"". Ostensibly, the angle on Ali that this documentary takes is examining The Greatest via his appearances on the popular 1970s TV talk show hosted by Dick Cavett, who was able to get some candid and genuine moments from the gregarious Ali when others failed at the task. Those interview clips are indeed fascinating, and in terms of the info this doc presents on Ali's involvement within the Nation of Islam (and how he was very likely used as their puppet/mouthpiece), it did provide me with some interesting information to chew on. To be honest, I wish the entire runtime would have simply focused on those two concepts (Cavett & Ali's religion/politics). Had that happened, this probably would have received a higher star ranking from me. As I said in the opening, though, ""Ali & Cavett"" spends too much time re-hashing Ali's boxing exploits and showing the same clips or sound bytes we've seen over and over already. Ali's larger-than-life status likely renders this too irresistible for the film makers to avoid, especially if roping in casual viewers is important (and it always is). For someone like myself who has ""seen them all"" when it comes to Ali docs, though, a solid 70% of this one is ""old news"". So, while I can't say this is a bad documentary by any stretch of the imagination, the amount of fresh, new material is relatively small within in. As such, your enjoyment of it overall may be determined by your previous Ali knowledge level."
Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes (2018),A whole lot more about Ali than it is about Cavett,"""Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes"" (2018 release; 95 min.) is a documentary centered around Muhammed Ali's frequent guest appearances on The Dick Cavett Show. As the movie opens, we see a multitude of short clips where Cavett introduces Ali, while a voice-over reminds us how big the show was in that era (late 60s-early/mid 70s), taking it ""to the edge of the racial debate in this country"". We then go back in time, understanding how these two met in the early 60s when Cavett was working on the Jerry Lewis show, and we work our way up in time from there. At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary. Couple of comments: the documentary is the directing debut of Richard S. Bader, the long-standing Dick Cavett expert who has produced a number of Cavett-associated releases. He co-wrote the script with Cavett himself for this film. While the movie's title indicates equal billing for Ali and Cavett, in reality this movie is a whole lot more about Ali than it is about Cavett, to the point where it seems Cavett is mere background dressing, and providing a convenient entrance angle to look at Ali's fascinating, if complicated, life as an athlete, political activist, and all-around global mega-star. ""Ali is much smarter than he lets on"", observes Cavett, but I don't know if that is the case, as the many clips ooze with Ali's savvy and smarts. ""Was Ali a racist? a mouthpiece for the Nation of Islam?"", someone ponders, and that is a darn good question, and one that is impossible to fully answer. Certainly Ali said things that, if there were spoken by a white person, would immediately be condemned as racist. But one thing that nobody can negate or deny: Ali (as demonstrated in his many appearances on the Dick Cavett Show) was a magnetic personality and an amazing boxer. We can only wonder how much more he would have accomplished in the boxing ring had he not been banned for 3+ years in the prime of his boxing career. Back to Cavett: it is clear from the clips and from Cavett's own comments taped for this film that his affection for Ali is genuine and runs deep. ""Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes"" originally premiered 2 years ago at SXSW and then... nothing. But it started showing earlier this week on HBO and is now available at HBO On Demand and other streaming services. I quite enjoyed this documentary, and if you have any interest in Muhammed Ali, I might suggest you check it out and draw your own conclusion."
Ali & Cavett: The Tale of the Tapes (2018),"An Amazing Lost Treasure Reveals the Story of the ""Greatest""","Ali & Cavett was enthusiastically welcomed in its world premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was introduced by film critic Leonard Maltin who interviewed Dick Cavett afterwards. The documentary was made with recovered footage of more than a dozen appearances that Muhammad Ali made on Dick Cavett's talk show. Ali was electrifying. When he was at his height his speech was mesmerizing and he was really a force of nature. The film beautifully captures Ali as a sports figure, but more importantly as a cultural figure who broke barriers to challenge barriers of race and religion. He challenged the U.S. government's attempt to draft him and although he won, he paid a very heavy price. It shows him with his friend Dick Cavett and brings the politics and social conflict around Ali into clear focus. These tapes are a lost treasure. The director skillfully edits the tapes with other footage to provide a mini-biography of ""The Greatest."" The film would fit together well with the Oscar-winning documentary ""When We Were Kings"" about the Ali- 1974 ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with George Foreman. I hope that the film gets distribution, because it can help bring this larger than life figure a new generation that came of age when he was well past his prime. Highly Recommended."
